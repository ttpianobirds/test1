LESSON 1

PERSEVERANCE

坚持不懈


1．"Will you give my kite a lift?" said my little nephew to his sister, after trying in vain to make it fly by dragging it along the ground. Lucy very kindly took it up and threw it into the air, but, her brother neglecting to run off at the same moment, the kite fell down again.

2．"Ah! now, how awkward you are!" said the little fellow. "It was your fault entirely," answered his sister. "Try again, children," said I.

3．Lucy once more took up the kite. But now John was in too great a hurry; he ran off so suddenly that he twitched the kite out of her hand, and it fell flat as before. "Well, who is to blame now?" asked Lucy. "Try again," said I.



4．They did, and with more care; but a side wind coming suddenly, as Lucy let go the kite, it was blown against some shrubs, and the tail became entangled(1) in a moment, leaving the poor kite hanging with its head downward.

5．"There, there!" exclaimed John," that comes of your throwing it all to one side. ""As if I could make the wind blow straight," said Lucy. In the meantime, I went to the kite's assistance(2); and having disengaged(3) the long tail, I rolled it up, saying, "Come, children, there are too many trees here; let us find a more open space, and then try again."

6．We presently found a nice grassplot(4), at one side of which I took my stand; and all things being prepared, I tossed the kite up just as little John ran off. It rose with all the dignity(5) of a balloon, and promised a lofty flight; but John, delighted to find it pulling so hard at the string, stopped short to look upward and admire. The string slackened, the kite wavered, and, the wind not being very favorable, down came the kite to the grass. "O John, you should not have stopped," said I. "However, try again."

7．"I won't try any more," replied he, rather sullenly. "It is of no use, you see. The kite won't fly, and I don't want to be plagued with it any longer. ""Oh, fie, my little man! would you give up the sport, after all the pains we have taken both to make and to fly the kite? A few disappointments(6) ought not to discourage(7) us. Come, I have wound up your string, and now try again."

8．And he did try, and succeeded, for the kite was carried upward on the breeze as lightly as a feather; and when the string was all out, John stood in great delight, holding fast the stick and gazing on the kite, which now seemed like a little white speck in the blue sky. "Look, look, aunt, how high it flies! and it pulls like a team of horses, so that I can hardly hold it. I wish I had a mile of string: I am sure it would go to the end of it."

9．After enjoying the sight as long as he pleased, little John proceeded to roll up the string slowly; and when the kite fell, he took it up with great glee(8), saying that it was not at all hurt, and that it had behaved very well. "Shall we come out to-morrow, aunt, after lessons, and try again?"

10．"I have no objection, my dear, if the weather is fine. And now, as we walk home, tell me what you have learned from your morning's sport. ""I have learned to fly my kite properly. ""You may thank aunt for it, brother," said Lucy, "for you would have given it up long ago, if she had not persuaded you to try again."

11．"Yes, dear children, I wish to teach you the value of perseverance,(9) even when nothing more depends upon it than the flying of a kite. Whenever you fail in your attempts to do any good thing, let your motto(10) be,—try again."



EXERCISES. —What is the subject of this lesson? Why was John discouraged in his attempts to fly his kite? What did his aunt say to him? What may we learn from this? What should be our motto if we expect to be successful?

1．“能不能给我的风筝助个力？”我的小侄子对他妹妹说。之前他在地上拖着风筝，试着让它飞起来，但是失败了。他的妹妹露西热心地举起风筝，将它抛向空中，可是哥哥没有在同时起跑，于是风筝又摔了下来。

2．“哎呀！你怎么这么笨手笨脚的！”小家伙说。“这全都是你的错。”他妹妹反驳道。我说：“孩子们，再试一次。”

3．露西再一次把风筝拿了起来。但这回约翰太心急了，他起跑得过于突然，把露西拿着的风筝扯得脱了手，结果像之前一样以失败告终。“现在是谁的错了？”露西问道。“再试试。”我说。

4．他们又试了一次，这次更加小心了。但忽然从侧面来了一阵大风，当露西松手放飞风筝的时候，它被吹到了一片灌木丛中，尾部一时间缠绕在了一起，可怜的风筝就头向下挂在了树丛中。

5．“看吧，看吧！”约翰叫道，“这就是你把它抛向一边的结果。”“好像我能让风直着吹似的。”露西说。与此同时，我过去帮忙捡风筝。解开了风筝的长尾巴，我一边把它收起来一边说：“来吧，孩子们，这里树丛太多，我们去找个更开阔的地方，然后再试一次吧。”

6．不一会儿，我们找到了一片非常不错的草地，我在草地一边站定。一切都准备就绪，我将风筝高高地向上抛起，约翰开始起跑。风筝像气球一样稳稳地飞了起来，似乎有希望可以飞得很高。但是当约翰发现它在用力地扯动风筝线时，他大喜过望，顿时停下脚步抬头欣赏起来。线一松，风筝开始摇摆，加上风势不太理想，它一下子掉在了草地上。“噢，约翰，刚才你不应该停下，”我说道，“不管怎么说，再来一次吧。”

7．“我不想再试了”，他回答道，“你看到了，这根本没用。风筝飞不起来，我可再也不想让它折磨我了。”“得了，我的小男子汉！之前我们费了那么大劲做风筝、放风筝，难道你想放弃了？我们不应该被一点小小的挫折弄得灰心丧气。来吧，我给你绕好风筝线，现在再来试一次。”

8．他的确又试了一次，这一次成功了，风筝像一片羽毛一样轻盈地被风吹着飞上了天空。当线都用完了，约翰站在那儿兴高采烈地凝望着风筝，手里紧紧攥着风筝杆。这时，风筝在蔚蓝的天空下看上去就像一张小小的白纸片。“姨妈，快看，快看，它飞得多高啊！感觉像有一群马在拉绳子，我都快拽不住了。我多希望绳子有一英里那么长啊，我相信即使那么长，我的风筝也能飞到头。”

9．直到他欣赏够了，小约翰才开始慢慢地收回风筝线。风筝一落地，他就满心欢喜地捡了起来，说它毫发未损，刚才的表现棒极了。“姨妈，我们明天下课后还可以出来玩儿吗？还可以再来一次吗？”

10．“亲爱的，只要天气好，我没有任何意见。现在我们回家。边走边告诉我，你从上午的户外活动中学到些什么。”“我学会了用正确的方法放风筝。”“弟弟，你可得感谢姨妈，”露西说道，“要不是姨妈一再劝你再试一次，你肯定早就放弃了。”

11．“没错，孩子们，尽管还有很多事比放风筝更需要坚持不懈的精神，但我希望能够通过这件事教给你们这种精神的意义所在。以后每当你在遇到挫折时，给自己的座右铭应该是——再试一次。”

LESSON 3

WHY THE SEA IS SALT

海水为什么是咸的


Mary Howitt was born in 1804, at Coleford, England. She wrote many charming stories for children in prose and verse, and also translated many from Swedish, Danish, and German authors. This story is arranged from one in a collection named "Peter Drake's Dream, and Other Stories. "She died in 1888.



1．There were, in very ancient times, two brothers, one of whom was rich, and the other poor. Christmas was approaching, but the poor man had nothing in the house for a Christmas dinner; so he went to his brother and asked him for a trifling(1) gift.

2．The rich man was ill-natured, and when he heard his brother's request he looked very surly. But as Christmas is a time when even the worst people give gifts, he took a fine ham down from the chimney, where it was hanging to smoke, threw it at his brother, and bade him begone and never to let him see his face again.

3．The poor man thanked his brother for the ham, put it under his arm, and went his way. He had to pass through a great forest on his way home. When he had reached the thickest part of it, he saw an old man, with a long, white beard, hewing timber. "Good evening," said he to him.

4．"Good evening," returned the old man, raising himself up from his work, and looking at him. "That is a fine ham you are carrying. "On this, the poor man told him all about it.

5．"It is lucky for you," said the old man, "that you have met with me. If you will take that ham into the land of the dwarfs, the entrance to which lies just under the roots of this tree, you can make a capital bargain with it; for the dwarfs are very fond of ham, and rarely get any. But mind what I say: you must not sell it for money, but demand for it the 'old hand mill (2)which stands behind the door. 'When you come back, I'll show you how to use it."

6．The poor man thanked his new friend, who showed him the door under a stone below the roots of the tree, and by this door he entered into the land of the dwarfs. No sooner had he set his foot in it, than the dwarfs swarmed about him, attracted(3) by the smell of the ham. They offered him queer, old-fashioned money and gold and silver ore for it; but he refused all their tempting offers, and said that he would sell it only for the old hand mill behind the door.

7．At this, the dwarfs held up their little old hands, and looked quite perplexed(4). "We can not make a bargain, it seems," said the poor man, "so I'll bid you all a good day."

8．The fragrance(5) of the ham had by this time reached the remote parts of dwarf land. The dwarfs came flocking around in little troops, leaving their work of digging out precious ores, eager for the ham.

9．"Let him have the old mill," said some of the newcomers;" it is quite out of order, and he don't know how to use it. Let him have it, and we will have the ham."

10．So the bargain was made. The poor man took the old hand mill, which was a little thing not half so large as the ham, and went back to the woods. Here the old man showed him how to use it. All this had taken up a great deal of time, and it was midnight before he reached home.

11．"Where in the world have you been?" said his wife. "Here I have been waiting and waiting, and we have no wood to make a fire, nor anything to put into the porridge pot for our Christmas supper."

12．The house was dark and cold; but the poor man bade his wife wait and see what would happen. He placed the little hand mill on the table, and began to turn the crank. First, out there came some grand, lighted wax candles, and a fire on the hearth, and a porridge pot boiling over it, because in his mind he said they should come first. Then he ground out a tablecloth, and dishes, and spoons, and knives and forks.

13．He was himself astonished at his good luck, as you may believe; and his wife was almost beside herself with joy and astonishment. Well, they had a capital supper; and after it was eaten, they ground out of the mill every possible thing to make their house and themselves warm and comfortable. So they had a merry Christmas eve and morning.

玛丽·豪伊特，1804年生于英国科尔福德。她以诗歌和散文的形式为孩子们写下了许多动人的故事，同时还翻译了不少瑞典、丹麦和德国作家的作品。这则故事节选自《彼特·德雷克之梦和其他故事》系列丛书。她于1888年辞世。



1．很久很久以前，有两个兄弟，其中一个很富有，另外一个很贫穷。圣诞节即将来临，穷人家里没有任何吃的可以做圣诞晚餐，于是他去找他的兄弟，希望能从他那里得到一点微不足道的小礼物。

2．那个富人生性恶毒，当他听说了他兄弟的请求时，他看起来异常粗暴。但是由于在圣诞节时连最坏的人都要送出礼物，他便从烟囱里取下一块正在熏制的上好火腿，扔给了他的兄弟，并命令他赶快滚开，再也不要让他看见。

3．穷人将火腿夹在胳膊下就上路了。回家路上需要穿过一大片森林，当他到达森林最深处时，看到了一位留着长长白胡须的老人正在伐木。“晚上好，”他对老人说。

4．老人从劳作中直起腰，看着他回答道：“晚上好。”“你拿的这块火腿看起来很不错。”于是，穷人把有关火腿的事源源本本地告诉了老人。

5．老人说：“遇到我是你运气好。如果你带着火腿去矮人国，你可以用这个跟他们大大地讨价还价一番，因为他们非常喜欢火腿，可是很难弄到。去那里的入口就在这棵树的树根下面。但是请记住我的话：你一定不能为了钱去卖火腿，而是要交换‘门后面那台老旧的手工磨粉机’。等你回来后，我会告诉你如何使用它。”

6．老人指给他看树根下的大石头，石头下面就是通向矮人国的大门，穷人谢过了他的新朋友，顺着这个门走了进去。当他的双脚刚刚踏上矮人国的地盘，火腿的味道把矮人们全都吸引了过来，他们蜂拥而至，把他团团围住。他们想用很多奇异的古老钱币以及金银宝石来交换火腿，但他拒绝一切诱人的条件，说他只想用火腿换门后的那台老式手工磨粉机。

7．矮人们看起来对他的这一举动感到非常困惑不解，纷纷举起他们饱经沧桑的小手。穷人说：“看来我们没法达成一致了，祝大家都有愉快的一天。”

8．此时此刻，火腿的香气已经飘到了矮人国的深处，矮人们迫不及待地想得到火腿，全都丢下手里正在挖掘的珍贵宝石，成群结队向他簇拥过来。

9．一些刚刚到达的矮人们说：“把那台老磨粉机给他吧，反正也不能用了，况且他也不知道怎么用。给他吧，这样火腿就归我们了。”

10．交易就这么完成了。那台老旧的手工磨粉机非常小巧，还没有火腿的一半大。穷人拿着它回到了森林里，他的那位新朋友告诉了他如何操作。整个过程花费了很长时间，他回到家时已经是后半夜了。

11．“你到底上哪儿去了？”他妻子问道，“我在家里等啊等，既没有木头生火，也没有任何食物能下锅熬粥准备圣诞晚餐。”

12．屋子里又黑又冷，但穷人让他妻子再等一会儿，看看会发生什么。他将那台小小的手工磨粉机放在桌上，开始转动手柄。首先出现的是一些华丽的燃烧着的蜡烛、壁炉里的火焰、一锅沸腾着要流出来的粥，因为在他脑海里，他觉得这些应该最先出现。随后他又不断地磨啊磨，出现了一块台布、一些碟子、勺子和刀叉。

13．就像你想象的一样，连他自己都惊讶于他的好运气；他的妻子又高兴又吃惊，几乎不能自已。于是，他们享用了一顿丰盛的晚餐。用餐完毕，他们又磨出了能使他们的屋子和他们自己感到温暖舒适的各种物品。这样一来，他们度过了一个非常美妙的圣诞前夜和圣诞节清晨。

LESSON 4

WHY THE SEA IS SALT (CONCLUDED)

海水为什么是咸的（结束篇）


1．When the people went by the house to church, the next day, they could hardly believe their eyes. There was glass in the windows instead of a wooden shutter, and the poor man and his wife, dressed in nice new clothes, were seen devoutly(1) kneeling in the church.

2．"There is something very strange in all this," said everyone. "Something very strange indeed," said the rich man, when three days afterwards he received an invitation from his once poor brother to a grand feast. And what a feast it was! The table was covered with a cloth as white as snow, and the dishes were all of silver or gold. The rich man could not, in his great house, and with all his wealth, set out such a table.

3．"Where did you get all these things?" exclaimed he. His brother told him all about the bargain he had made with the dwarfs, and putting the mill on the table, ground out boots and shoes, coats and cloaks, stockings, gowns, and blankets, and bade his wife give them to the poor people that had gathered about the house to get a sight of the grand feast the poor brother had made for the rich one.

4．The rich man was very envious of his brother's good fortune, and wanted to borrow the mill, intending—for he was not an honest man— never to return it again. His brother would not lend it, for the old man with the white beard had told him never to sell or lend it to anyone.

5．Some years went on, and, at last, the possessor of the mill built himself a grand castle on a rock by the sea, facing the west. Its windows, reflecting(2) the golden sunset, could be seen far out from the shore. It became a noted landmark(3) for sailors. Strangers from foreign parts often came to see this castle and the wonderful mill of which the most extraordinary(4) tales were told.

6．At length, a great foreign merchant came, and when he had seen the mill, inquired whether it would grind salt. Being told that it would, he wanted to buy it; for he traded in salt, and thought that if he owned it he could supply all his customers without taking long and dangerous voyages.

7．The man would not sell it, of course. He was so rich now that he did not want to use it for himself; but every Christmas he ground out food and clothes and coal for the poor, and nice presents for the little children. So he rejected all the offers of the rich merchant. The merchant, however, determined to have it; he bribed one of the man's servants to let him go into the castle at night, and he stole the mill and sailed away with it in triumph.

8．He had scarcely got out to sea, before he determined to set the mill to work. "Now, mill, grind salt," said he;" grind salt with all your might!— salt, salt, and nothing but salt!" The mill began to grind and the sailors to fill the sacks; but these were soon full, and in spite of all that could be done, it began to fill the ship.

9．The dishonest merchant was now very much frightened. What was to be done? The mill would not stop grinding; and at last the ship was overloaded, and down it went, making a great whirlpool(5) where it sank. The ship soon went to pieces; but the mill stands on the bottom of the sea, and keeps grinding out "salt, salt, nothing but salt!" That is the reason, say the peasants(6) of Denmark and Norway, why the sea is salt.



EXERCISES. —How did the poor man find the way to the land of the dwarfs? Do you think the old man would have told him if the poor man had not been so polite? How did the poor man treat his rich brother in return for his unkindness? How was the greed of the dishonest merchant punished? What is meant by " strangers from foreign parts"? Where are Denmark and Norway?

1．第二天，当人们去教堂路过他家时，他们简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。他家窗户上不再是木头窗板，而是装上了玻璃。人们看到那个穷人和他妻子穿着体面的新衣服跪在教堂祈祷。

2．每个人都说：“这其中肯定发生了非常奇怪的事。”“的确有奇怪的事发生，”有钱人说道。之后第三天，他接到了那位曾经一贫如洗的兄弟发来的请柬，邀请他去享用一顿盛宴。那是怎样的一个盛宴啊！餐桌上铺着雪白雪白的桌布，餐具不是金的就是银的。即便是在有钱人的大房子里，倾其所有，也准备不出这样一张餐桌。

3．“你是从哪里弄到这些东西的？”他大叫道。他兄弟源源本本地告诉了他和矮人们做的交易的事，并把磨粉机放在桌子上转，转出了靴子和鞋子，衣服和披风，还有长袜、女士长袍和毯子。穷人让妻子把这些东西分给那些围观的穷人们，他们聚集在房子周围，想来看看穷兄弟为有钱人准备的大餐。

4．有钱人非常嫉妒他兄弟的好运气，想要借走磨粉机——由于他是一个不讲诚信的人，他根本没打算归还。他的兄弟没有答应，因为白胡子老者曾经告诫他不要把磨粉机借给或卖给任何人。

5．许多年过去了，磨粉机的拥有者终于为他自己建造了一座很大的城堡。它坐落在紧临海边的岩石上，朝向西方。每当夕阳西下的时候，窗户上便会反射上金色的余晖，从距离海边很远的地方就能看到，这也就成了水手们眼中的显著标志物。通常有很多外乡的陌生人慕名而来，就是想看看这座城堡以及这台出现在最不同寻常的传说故事中的磨粉机。

6．终于有一天，一位外国富商来到这里。当他看到磨粉机时，询问它是否能够用来出盐。得到肯定答复后，他想要买下它。因为他从事的是盐业贸易，想着如果拥有了这台机器，他不用冒着危险远渡涉水就能为顾客供应食盐了。

7．磨粉机的所有者当然不会卖掉它。他现在家境富裕，根本不想为了自己的利益去使用它了，而是在每年圣诞节时用它为穷人们磨出衣服和煤火，为小孩子们磨出漂亮的礼物。因此，他拒绝了富商的一切出价。但富商一心想得到磨粉机，于是他贿赂了富人身边的一名侍从，在夜间放他进入了城堡。他真的偷到了磨粉机，带着胜利的喜悦乘船离去。

8．他坐的船刚到海上，他就打算开始让磨粉机工作了。“磨粉机，现在出盐，”他说，“开足马力出盐喽！——盐、盐、除了盐还是盐！”磨粉机开始不停地出盐，水手们则把盐都装进了麻袋；这些袋子不一会儿就全装满了，尽管所有能做的都做了，但盐还是把整艘船全装满了。

9．这个不诚实的富商现在开始感觉非常害怕了。还能做些什么呢？磨粉机不停地出盐，最后船变得极度超重，整个翻了过去，船沉没时掀起了巨大的旋涡。不一会儿，船身四分五裂，但磨粉机留在了深深的海底，还在不停地出着盐。“盐、盐、除了盐还是盐”，丹麦和挪威的农民常说，海水为什么是咸的，这就是原因所在。

LESSON 5

POPPING CORN

爆米花


1．One autumn night, when the wind was high,

And the rain fell in heavy plashes,

A little boy sat by the kitchen fire,

A-popping corn in the ashes;

And his sister, a curly-haired child of three,

Sat looking on, just close to his knee.

2．Pop! pop! and the kernels, one by one,

Came out of the embers flying;

The boy held a long pine stick in his hand,

And kept it busily plying

He stirred the corn and it snapped the more,



And faster jumped to the clean-swept floor.

3．Part of the kernels flew one way,

And a part hopped out the other;

Some flew plump into the sister's lap,

Some under the stool of the brother;

The little girl gathered them into a heap,

And called them a flock of milk-white sheep.

1．八月夜晚，狂风不断，

雨滴哗啦啦敲打地面，

小男孩坐在厨房的火炉旁，

炉灰里在爆玉米，

他的妹妹头发卷卷，年龄只有三周岁，

坐在他的膝盖边细细观看。

2．砰！砰！玉米粒一个接一个爆开，

炉灰的余烬飞逸出来，

男孩手里拿着一条长长的松枝，

不停地在炉子里拨动；

他碰一碰玉米，更多的玉米粒爆开了，

很快都蹦到了干净的地板上。

3．一部分玉米粒蹦向了一个方向，

还有一部分比它们跳得还远；

一些胖胖的玉米花飞到了妹妹的腿上，

还有的跑到了哥哥的椅子下面，

小女孩把它们集中起来堆成一堆，

管它们叫一群奶白色的绵羊。





LESSON 6

SMILES

微　笑


1．Poor lame Jennie sat at her window, looking out upon the dismal(1), narrow street, with a look of pain and weariness on her face. "Oh, dear," she said with a sigh, "what a long day this is going to be," and she looked wishfully(2) up the street.

2．Suddenly she leaned forward and pressed her pale face against the glass, as a rosy-cheeked boy came racing down the street, swinging his schoolbooks by the strap. Looking up to the window, he took off his hat and bowed with a bright, pleasant smile.

3．"What a nice boy he is," said Jennie to herself, as he ran out of sight. "I am so glad he goes by here on his way to school. When he smiles, it seems like having the sun shine. I wish everybody who goes by would look up and smile."

4．"Mamma," said George West, as he came from school, "I can't help thinking about that poor little girl I told you of the other day. She looks so tired. I took off my hat and bowed to her to-day. I wish I could do something for her."

5．"Suppose you should carry her a handful of pretty flowers some time when you go to school," said Mrs. West. "I'll do that to-morrow morning," said George, "if I can find my way into that rickety(3) old house."

6．The next morning, as Jennie sat leaning her head wearily against the window, watching the raindrops chasing one another down the glass, she spied George with a handful of beautiful flowers carefully picking his way across the street. He stopped in front of her window, and, smiling very pleasantly, said, "How shall I find the way to your room?"

7．Jennie pointed to an alley near by, where he turned in, and with some difficulty found his way to the dingy(4) staircase. Opening the door to Jennie's gentle "Come in," he said, "I have brought you a handful of flowers to look at this rainy day."

8．"Are they for me?" exclaimed Jennie, clapping her hands in delight. "How kind you are," she continued, as George laid them in her lap. "I have not had a flower since we live in the city."

9．"Did you use to live in the country?" asked George. "Oh, yes," answered Jennie, "we used to live in a beautiful cottage, and there were trees and flowers and green grass, and the air was so sweet."

10．"Well, what made you move here?" "Oh," said Jennie, softly, "papa died, and mamma was sick so long that the money was all gone. Then mamma had to sell the cottage, and she moved here to try to get work to do."

11．"Do you have to sit here all day?" asked George, glancing(5) around the bare room and out into the dismal street. "Yes," said Jennie, "because I am lame; but I would not care for that, if I could only help mamma."

12．"I declare, it's too had!" said George, who dreaded nothing so much as being obliged to stay in the house. "Oh, no, it isn't," said Jennie, pleasantly;" mamma says maybe we should forget the Lord if we had everything we wanted, and He never forgets us, you know."

13．"Well, I must rush for school," said George, not knowing exactly what to say next; and he was soon out of Jennie's sight, but had a happy little corner in his heart, because he had tried to do a kind act. He did not know how much good he had done in making a pleasant day out of a dreary(6) one for a little sick girl.

14．"Mamma," said George, that evening, after he had told her what Jennie said, "papa must give them some money, so they can go back to their home."

15．"No," said his mother;" he can not do that, and they would not wish him to do so; but perhaps he can help us contrive(7) some way to assist them, so that they can live more comfortably."

16．"I am going to carry Jennie some of the grapes grandpa sent me, tomorrow," said George, turning over the leaves of his geography. "I will put some of my pears into your basket, and go with you," said his mother;" but there is one thing we can always give, and sometimes it does more good than nice things to eat, or even money."

17．"What is that, mamma,—smiles?" asked George, looking up. "Yes," answered his mother;" and it is a good plan to throw in a kind word or two with them, when you can."



EXERCISES. —What is the subject of this lesson? How did George West make the day pleasant for Jennie? What did his mother suggest? What happened next day? What did Jennie tell George about her life? Relate what happened at George's home that evening. What does the lesson teach?





【中文阅读】


1．可怜的跛脚珍妮坐在窗前，望着外面阴沉、狭窄的街道，脸上写满了痛苦和倦意。“哎呀，”她叹口气说道，“这将是多漫长的一天啊。”她眼巴巴地看着街道的尽头。

2．她忽然探身向前，将苍白的小脸紧贴在窗户玻璃上。这时从街的尽头跑过来一个脸上粉嘟嘟的男孩，手里抓着书包带将书包甩来甩去。他抬头看到窗户，立即摘下帽子，鞠了一躬，脸上挂着阳光般的友好笑容。

3．当他跑出了珍妮的视线，她自言自语道：“他真是个可爱的孩子！我真高兴他每天上学都从这儿经过。当他微笑时，仿佛让人沐浴在阳光里。我希望每个路过的人都能抬头微笑一下。”

4．“妈妈，”乔治·威斯特一从学校回到家就叫道，“我总会不由自主地想起那天我和您说过的那个可怜的小女孩。她看上去疲倦极了。今天我摘下帽子朝她鞠躬行礼。我希望能为她做些什么。”

5．“也许什么时候你去学校可以给她带一捧美丽的鲜花，”威斯特夫人说道。“只要能找到进入那栋老旧危房的路，我明天早上就可以按您说的这么做，”乔治说。

6．第二天清晨，珍妮倦怠地将头靠在窗户上，看着雨点一滴一滴接连不断地沿着玻璃流下去。她忽然注意到乔治手里拿着一捧美丽的鲜花正在小心翼翼地过马路。他在她的窗前停了下来，非常友善地微笑着说：“我怎样才能找到通往你房间的路？”

7．珍妮指了指附近的一条小路。他拐了进去，颇为费劲地找到了昏暗的楼梯。随着珍妮轻柔的一声“请进”，门开了。他说：“我给你带了鲜花，你在雨天里可以看看的。”

8．“它们是给我的吗？”珍妮惊呼，高兴得拍起手来。“你真是个热心肠。”乔治将花放在她膝盖上，她继续说道：“自从搬到城里来住，我还没见过花儿呢。”

9．“你原来一直住在乡下吗？”乔治问道。“是的，”珍妮回答，“我们原来住在乡间小屋里，那里有很多树很多花，还有大片大片的绿草，就连空气都散发着香甜的味道。”

10．“是什么原因让你搬到这里来的？”“噢，”珍妮缓缓地柔声说道，“爸爸去世了，妈妈又一直生病，钱都花完了。后来妈妈不得不卖掉房子，搬到这里来想办法找点事做。”

11．乔治扫了一眼空荡荡的屋子和窗外阴郁的街道，问道：“你必须整天都坐在这儿吗？”“是的，”珍妮回答，“因为我的腿有残疾；但其实我不太在意这个，只希望能给妈妈帮点忙。”

12．“我敢说你已经做到了！”乔治说道。

13．乔治不知下面该说些什么，只好说：“好了，我得赶快跑去上学了。”随后他就一溜烟儿跑出了珍妮的视线。但他内心深处感到非常愉快，因为他在努力做一件好事。但他不知道把一个生病小女孩面对的沉闷的一天变成了快乐的一天是多大的一个善举。

14．那天晚上，在把珍妮的话告诉了他母亲之后，乔治说：“妈妈，爸爸应该给她们些钱，这样她们就能回原来的家啦。”

15．“不，”他母亲说道，“爸爸他没法这么做。而且她们也不希望他这么做。但或许他能帮我们想些援助她们母女的方法，这样她们就能生活得更舒适些。”

16．“明天我打算给珍妮拿些奶奶给我的葡萄，”乔治边翻着他的地理书边说。“我会给你的篮子里放些梨，和你一起去。”他母亲说道，“但有一样东西我们总能给予她们，而且有时候它比好吃的或是金钱更好。”

17．“那是什么呀，妈妈，——是微笑吗？”乔治抬头看着妈妈问。“是啊，”他母亲回答，“而且尽可能地在微笑时说一两句友好的话是个好方法。”

LESSON 7

LAZY NED

懒人奈德


1．"'T is royal(1) fun," cried lazy Ned,

"To coast(2) upon my fine, new sled,

And beat the other boys;

But then, I can not bear to climb

The tiresome hill, for every time

It more and more annoys(3)."

2．So, while his schoolmates glided by,

And gladly tugged uphill, to try

Another merry race,

Too indolent(4) to share their plays,

Ned was compelled to stand and gaze,

While shivering in his place.

3．Thus, he would never take the pains

To seek the prize(5) that labor gains,

Until the time had passed;

For, all his life, he dreaded still

The silly bugbear(6) of uphill,

And died a dunce(7) at last.



EXERCISES. —What did Ned like? What did he not like?

1．“这个非常有意思，”懒人奈德大叫道，

乘坐我全新的高级雪橇去滑冰，

把其他男生都比下去；

但是我受不了去爬，

那累人的山，因为每次

都让我感到越来越不胜其烦。

2．因此，当他的校友们从身边滑过，

兴高采烈地将雪橇拉上山顶，尝试进行

又一次愉快的比赛时，

由于太懒惰而没有加入他们的游戏，

奈德只得站在一旁观看，

在原地瑟瑟发抖。

3．即便这样，他也不愿下工夫

去追求劳动带来的收获，

直到时间流逝，

终其一生，他一直畏惧

那愚蠢的“上山”心结，

最后碌碌无为地死去。

LESSON 8

THE MONKEY

猴　子


1．The monkey is a very cunning(1) little animal, and is found in many parts of the world.

2．A lady once had a monkey, which had been brought to her as a present. This monkey, like all others, was very fond of mischief and of doing whatever he saw others do.

3．His mistress found him one day sitting on her toilet table(2), holding in one hand a little china mug with water in it, and in the other her toothbrush, with which he was cleaning his teeth, looking all the time in the glass.



4．Her little daughter, Maria, had a large doll with a very handsome head and face. She one day left this doll in the cradle, and went out of the room. The monkey came in, took the doll in his arms, and jumping upon the washstand, he began to wash its face.

5．He first rubbed it all over with soap. Then seizing the towel, he dipped it in the washbowl, and rubbed it so hard that the doll's face was entirely spoiled, the paint being all washed off.

6．There have been many tales of monkeys who, armed with sticks, have joined together and made war or resisted(3) their enemies with great effect. These are not true, as it is known that in their native state monkeys have no idea of weapons.

7．The sticks and other missiles(4) said to be thrown at travelers as they pass under the branches of trees, are usually the dead branches, etc. , accidentally broken off, as the monkeys, with the natural curiosity of their tribe, pass along the tops of trees to watch the actions of the people below.

8．They can, however, be taught to use a stick, and to use it well. Some time ago, two Italians together owned an organ and a monkey, by means of which they earned their living. During one of their exhibitions(5), a dog flew at the little monkey, which made its owners very angry.

9．They and the owner of the dog quarreled about it, and at last it was agreed that the dog and the monkey should fight it out; the monkey, because he was smaller, was to be allowed a stick.

10．The monkey was taught what he was to do in the following manner: One of the Italians crawled on his hands and knees, barking like a dog, while the other got on his back, grasped his hair, and beat him about the head with a stick.

11．The monkey looked on with great gravity(6), and, when the instruction(7) was over, received the stick with the air of a man who knew his work and meant to do it.

12．Everything being settled the dog flew at the monkey with open month. The monkey immediately leaped on his back, and, grasping the dog's ear, beat away at his head with such good will that his adversary speedily gave in. The monkey, however, was not content with a mere victory, but continued pounding at the dog's head until he left him senseless(8) on the ground.



EXERCISES. —What kind of an animal is a monkey? Where did the lady find the monkey one day? What was he doing? What did he do with Maria's doll? Do monkeys in their native state know how to use sticks as weapons? Can they be taught to use them? Relate the story of the two Italians. What is the meaning of "etc." in the seventh paragraph?





【中文阅读】


1．猴子是一种非常灵巧的小动物，人们在世界上很多地方都发现了它们的踪影。

2．一位女士曾经有一只猴子，是别人送给她的礼物。这只猴子和它的同类们一样，非常淘气，总喜欢看别人做什么就做什么。

3．一天，它的女主人发现它坐在梳妆台上，一只手里握着一个小瓷杯，里面盛着水，另一只手里举着主人的牙刷，从始至终对着镜子清理它的牙齿。

4．女主人的小女儿玛丽亚有一个很大的娃娃，娃娃的头和脸都非常漂亮。有一天，她把娃娃放在摇篮里，随后出了房间。猴子跑了过来，把娃娃抱在怀里，跳到盥洗池边，开始给娃娃洗脸。

5．它首先把盥洗池里搓满了肥皂，然后拽来一条毛巾，把毛巾在洗脸池里蘸了蘸，拿毛巾用力地擦洗娃娃的脸，使得她的脸上一片狼藉，原来的颜料全部被洗掉了。

6．曾经有很多关于猴子的传说，说它们用木棍武装起来，并肩作战，有效地和敌人战斗或是打退它们的敌人。可这些并不是事实，因为众所周知的，猴子的头脑中生来并没有武器的概念。

7．当游客们经过树下，那些所谓向他们扔下来的棍子和投掷物通常都是些枯树枝之类的东西，偶然间折断了，又由于猴子种群好奇的天性，从树顶上一路跑来想看看人们在树下的活动。

8．当然，人们可以教它们使用棍子，它们可以用得很自如。之前，有两名意大利人拥有一架风琴和一只猴子，这两样是他们谋生的手段。在他们的一次公开表演中，一只狗扑向了小猴子，这让猴子的主人们非常恼火。

9．他们和狗的主人争吵了起来，最后达成一致，狗和猴子要一决雌雄，打出个结果来。因为猴子个头小，允许它使用棍子。

两个意大利人教猴子接下来该怎么做：其中一个人用手和膝盖撑在地上匍匐，像狗一样叫着；另一个人从背后搂住他，用手抓他的头发，用棍子敲击他的头部。

11．猴子非常认真地看着，当演示过程结束，它就接过棍子，神态俨然一个知道自己的任务并准备完成任务的人。

12．当一切就绪，那只狗张开大嘴扑向了猴子。猴子敏捷地跳到他的背后，一把抓住了大狗的耳朵，开始用力地击打它的头部，以至于它的对手很快败下阵来。但是猴子并没有满足于单纯的胜利，而是仍然不停地敲击他的头部，直到大狗被打得躺在地上失去知觉为止。

LESSON 9

MEDDLESOME MATTY

爱捣乱的玛蒂


1．Oh, how one ugly trick has spoiled

The sweetest and the best!

Matilda, though a pleasant child,

One grievous fault possessed,

Which, like a cloud before the skies,

Hid all her better qualities(1).

2．Sometimes, she'd lift the teapot lid

To peep at what was in it;

Or tilt, the kettle, if you did

But turn your back a minute.

In vain you told her not to touch,

Her trick of meddling(2) grew so much.

3．Her grandmamma went out one day,

And, by mistake, she laid

Her spectacles and snuffbox gay,

Too near the little maid;

"Ah! well," thought she, "I'll try them on,

As soon as grandmamma is gone."

4．Forthwith(3), she placed upon her nose

The glasses large and wide;

And looking round, as I suppose,

The snuffbox, too, she spied(4)."

Oh, what a pretty box is this!

I'll open it," said little miss.

5．"I know that grandmamma would say,

'Don't meddle with it, dear;'

But then she's far enough away,

And no one else is near;

Beside, what can there be amiss(5)

In opening such a box as this?"

6．So, thumb and finger went to work

To move the stubborn lid;

And, presently, a mighty jerk

The mighty mischief did;

For all at once, ah! woeful(6) case!

The snuff came puffing in her face.

7．Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth, and chin

A dismal sight presented;

And as the snuff got further in,

Sincerely she repented.

In vain she ran about for ease,

She could do nothing else but sneeze.

8．She dashed the spectacles away,

To wipe her tingling(7) eyes;

And, as in twenty bits they lay,

Her grandmamma she spies.

"Heyday! and what's the matter now?"

Cried grandmamma, with angry brow.

9．Matilda, smarting with the pain,

And tingling still, and sore,

Made many a promise to refrain(8)

From meddling evermore;

And 't is a fact, as I have heard,

She ever since has kept her word.



EXERCISES. —What did Matilda do? How was she punished? What effect did it have on her?





【中文阅读】


1．哦，一个丑陋的把戏是如何毁掉了

最甜美、最好的一切啊！

虽说玛蒂达是个讨人喜欢的孩子，

但她有一个严重的毛病，

就像是天空中的乌云，

遮挡住了她所有的优秀品质。

2．有时候，她会拿起茶壶盖，

偷看里面是什么，

或者将水壶斜过来，如果你

转过身一分钟时间，

尽管你告诉她不要碰，但无济于事，

她爱捣乱的毛病有增无减。

3．一天她祖母外出，

不小心把

她的老花镜和颜色鲜艳的鼻烟盒

放得离小女孩太近了，

“啊，好！”她想，“等祖母一出门，

我来试试它们。”

4．随即，她把又大又宽的眼镜

架在了鼻梁上；

环顾四周，我猜

她也偷偷地看了鼻烟盒。

“噢，这个盒子多漂亮啊！

我来把它打开，”小女子说。

5．“我知道祖母肯定会说，

别碰它，亲爱的，”

但是她现在出门走远了，

这里又没有其他人，

再说，打开盒子看一下

又能出什么差错呢？

6．这样一想，拇指和食指开始一起工作

来扭动紧紧的盖子；

现在，一次小聪明造成

猛烈的一抖；

忽然间，啊！糟了！

鼻烟都吹到她脸上了。

7．可怜的眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴和下巴，

全都是一片狼藉；

当鼻烟飞到鼻子里，

她打心眼儿里感到懊悔，

她想跑一跑能舒服些，不料却无济于事，

她除了打喷嚏啥也干不了。

8．她把眼镜扔到一边，

来擦擦刺痛的眼睛；

她发现祖母回来了。

“嗨！发生什么事了？”

祖母横眉怒目地叫起来。

9．玛蒂达，因为眼睛刺痛而痛苦万分，

嗓子又疼又痒，

她向大家保证以后再也

不捣乱了；

这是一个事实，我听说的，

她从此以后说到做到。

LESSON 10

THE GOOD SON

好孩子


1．There was once a jeweler(1), noted(2) for many virtues. One day, the Jewish elders(3) came to him to buy some diamonds, to put upon that part of the dress of their high priest, which the Bible calls an ephod(4).

2．They told him what they wanted, and offered him a fair price for the diamonds(5). He replied that he could not let them see the jewels at that moment, and requested them to call again.

3．As they wanted them without delay, and thought that the object of the jeweler was only to increase the price of the diamonds, the elders offered him twice, then three times, as much as they were worth. But he still refused, and they went away in very bad humor(6).

4．Some hours after, he went to them, and placed before them the diamonds, for which they again offered him the last price they had named; but he said, "I will only accept the first one you offered to me this morning."

5．"Why, then, did you not close(7) with us at once?" asked they in surprise. "When you came," replied he, "my father had the key of the chest, in which the diamonds were kept, and as he was asleep, I should have been obliged to wake him to obtain them.

6．"At his age, a short hour of sleep does him a great deal of good; and for all the gold in the world, I would not be wanting in respect to my father, or take from him a single comfort."

7．The elders, affected by these feeling words, spread their hands upon the jeweler's head, and said, "Thou shalt be blessed of Him who has said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother;' and thy children shall one day pay thee the same respect and love thou hast shown to thy father."



EXERCISES. —Relate the story of the jeweler and his diamonds. What did the elders say to him, when they heard his reason for not giving them the diamonds at first?

1．曾经有一位珠宝匠，因其身上许多的优秀品质而为人们所熟知。一天，几位上了年纪的犹太长老到他店里来，想要买一些珠宝，用来装饰他们最高级别神职人员的服装，即《圣经》中提到的犹太教大祭司所穿的法衣。

2．他们告诉他需要什么样的珠宝，并且报的价格也公平合理。他回答说目前他没法让他们看珠宝，请他们再打电话和他联系。

3．由于他们当下就需要那些珠宝，不能耽搁，而且他们认为珠宝匠的目的只是为抬高售价，老先生们给他开出了相当于珠宝价值两倍的价格，然后又加到了三倍。但他还是拒绝了，老先生们只得怏怏离去。

4．几个小时之后，他去找他们，将珠宝摆在他们面前，老先生们仍然开出了最后提到的价码。但他说：“我只会接受今天早上你们最初开的价。”

5．“那你当时为什么不立刻和我们成交呢？”他们无比惊讶地问道。他回答：“当你们来时，我父亲保管着金库的钥匙，珠宝都保存在金库里。而我父亲当时正在睡觉，我本应该叫醒他，拿来钥匙。”

6．“但是到了他这个年纪，短短一小时的睡眠都会对他的身体非常有好处；再说，出于对父亲的敬爱，就算给我全世界的黄金，我也不会牺牲任何一点父亲休息的时间。”

7．珠宝匠一番饱含深情的话语深深打动了老先生们，他们用手拍拍他的头，说：“你必感谢那个说过‘尊敬你父亲母亲’的人，你的孩子们也将如你尊敬你父亲这样尊敬你。”

LESSON 11

TOMORROW

明　天


Mrs. M. B. Johnson is the authoress of "Tomorrow," one of a collection of poems entitled "Poems of Home Life."

1．A bright, merry boy, with laughing face,

Whose every motion was full of grace,

Who knew no trouble and feared no care,

Was the light of our household(1)—the youngest there.

2．He was too young, this little elf(2),

With troublesome questions to vex(3) himself;

But for many days a thought would rise,

And bring a shade to his dancing eyes.

3．He went to one whom he thought more wise

Than any other beneath the skies;

"Mother,"—O word that makes the home!—

"Tell me, when will to-morrow come?"

4．"It is almost night," the mother said,

"And time for my boy to be in bed;

When you wake up and it's day again,

It will be to-morrow, my darling, then."

5．The little boy slept through all the night,

But woke with the first red streak of light;

He pressed a kiss to his mother's brow,

And whispered, "Is it to-morrow now?"

6．"No, little Eddie, this is to-day:

To-morrow is always one night away."

He pondered(4) a while(5), but joys came fast,

And this vexing question quickly passed.

7．But it came again with the shades of night;

"Will it be to-morrow when it is light?"

From years to come he seemed care to borrow,

He tried so hard to catch to-morrow.

8．"You can not catch it, my little Ted;

Enjoy to-day," the mother said;

"Some wait for to-morrow through many a year——

It is always coming, but never is here."



EXERCISES. —What is meant by "dancing eyes" in the second stanza? What is meant by "the shades of night," in the seventh stanza? Of what name are " Eddie" and " Ted" nicknames? What troubled Eddie? Can you define tomorrow? What did Eddie's mother advise him to do?

1．一个阳光、快乐的男孩，脸上绽开笑颜，

他的举手投足都风度翩翩，

他不识困难，无忧无虑，

是我们家中的光明所在。

2．他太年轻，这个小精灵，

不会让费解的问题把自己折磨，

但很多天来，一个想法出现，

给他跃动的眼睛蒙上一层阴影。

3．他去找他认为比天底下任何人

都更具智慧的人请教；

“妈妈，”——哦，这个词切中要害，

“告诉我，明天什么时候到来？”

4．“现在已经是夜里了，”妈妈说，

“该是我儿子上床睡觉的时间了；

当你醒来时，就是白天了，

那时就是明天了，我的宝贝。”

5．小男孩整夜熟睡，

但随着早晨的第一缕阳光醒来；

他亲吻妈妈的额头，

轻声问道：“现在是‘明天’了吗？”

6．“不，小艾迪，这是‘今天’；

明天总是要过一个晚上。”

他思考了一会儿，但很快高兴了起来。

这个费解的问题很快过去了。

7．但它随着夜幕的降临又卷土重来；

“等天亮了是不是就是明天了？”

他似乎想要从未来的年月里借记时间，

他试图努力抓住明天。

8．“你是抓不住它的，我的小泰德；

享受‘今’天，”妈妈说道；

“有些人在一年中的每天等待明天

它总是即将到来，但永远无法到达。”

LESSON 12

WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY

有志者事竟成


1．Henry Bond was about ten years old when his father died. His mother found it difficult to provide for the support of a large family, thus left entirely in her care. By good management(1), however, she contrived to do so, and also to send Henry, the oldest, to school, and to supply him, for the most part, with such books as he needed.

2．At one time, however, Henry wanted a grammar, in order to join a class in that study, and his mother could not furnish(2) him with the money to buy it. He was very much troubled about it, and went to bed with a heavy heart, thinking what could be done.

3．On waking in the morning, he found that a deep snow had fallen, and the cold wind was blowing furiously(3). "Ah," said he, "it is an ill wind that blows nobody good."

4．He rose, ran to the house of a neighbor, and offered his service(4) to clear a path around his premises(5). The offer was accepted. Having completed this work, and received his pay, he went to another place for the same purpose, and then to another, until he had earned enough to buy a grammar.

5．When school commenced, Henry was in his seat, the happiest boy there, ready to begin the lesson in his new book.

6．From that time, Henry was always the first in all his classes. He knew no such word as fail, but always succeeded in all he attempted. Having the will, he always found the way.

1．在亨利·邦德大约十岁时，他的父亲去世了。支撑整个大家庭的重任全都落在了他母亲的身上，这让她感到异常的艰辛。但通过不断的苦心经营，她想尽办法撑起了这个家，还送她最大的孩子亨利去读书，给他提供了上学所需要的大部分书籍。

2．然而，有一次，亨利为了参加语法学习班，需要一本语法书，他母亲实在没有钱供他买书。这件事让他非常纠结，晚上躺在床上仍然忧心忡忡，一直在想能做些什么。

3．早晨醒来，他看到外面已经下了厚厚的一层雪，寒风猛烈地吹着。他说：“啊，这场恶劣的寒风让大家都够难受的。”

4．他迅速地起床，跑到邻居家里，提出为邻居的房屋四周清扫积雪。邻居接受了他的提议。当完成了这项工作，拿到了工钱，他又跑到另一处帮人扫雪，然后又去了另一家，直到他赚够了买语法书的钱。

5．等到开学时，亨利坐在他的位子上，等待开始学习新书上的第一课，他是班里最最开心的。

6．从那时起，亨利总是班上到校最早的。在他的心目中，没有“失败”一词，他总能够成功地做好他想做的事。有了意愿，他就总能够找到成功之路。

LESSON 13

PICCOLA

皮克拉


By Celia Laighton Thaxter, who was born at Portsmouth, N. H., June 29,1836. Much of her childhood was passed at White Island, one of the Isles of Shoals, off the coast of New Hampshire. "Among the Isles of Shoals" is her most noted work in prose. She published a volume of poems, many of which are favorites with children. She died in 1894.

1．Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear

What happened to Piccola, children dear?

'T is seldom Fortune such favor grants

As fell to this little maid of France.

2．'T was Christmas time, and her parents poor

Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,

Striving with poverty's patient pain

Only to live till summer again.

3．No gift for Piccola! sad were they

When dawned(1) the morning of Christmas day!

Their little darling no joy might stir(2);

St. Nicholas nothing would bring to her!

4．But Piccola never doubted at all

That something beautiful must befall(3)

Every child upon Christmas day,

And so she slept till the dawn was gray.



5．And full of faith, when at last she woke,

She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;

Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,

'T was plain St. Nicholas had been there.

6．In rushed Piccola, sweet, half wild—

Never was seen such a joyful child—

"See what the good saint brought!" she cried,

And mother and father must peep inside.

7．Now such a story I never heard!

There was a little shivering(4) bird!

A sparrow, that in at the window flew,

Had crept into Piccola's tiny(5) shoe!

8．"How good poor Piccola must have been!"

She cried, as happy as any queen,

While the starving sparrow she fed and warmed,

And danced with rapture(6), she was so charmed(7).

9．Children, this story I tell to you

Of Piccola sweet and her bird, is true.

In the far-off land of France, they say,

Still do they live to this very day.



EXERCISES. —What is meant by "driving the wolf from the door"? In the third stanza, what does " St. "before Nicholas mean? Who is St. Nicholas? What did Piccola find in her shoe on Christmas morning?

西莉亚•莱顿•萨克斯德著。她1836年6月2日生于新罕布什尔州朴茨茅斯市。她的大部分童年时光是在新罕布什尔州海边“多鱼群岛”中的怀特岛度过的。《海岛生活》是她最著名的作品之一。她还曾出版过很多诗集，广受小朋友们喜爱，于1894年去世。

1．可怜的，可爱的皮克拉！你们听说

皮克拉出什么事了，孩子们？

很少有人遭遇的这种不幸，

却发生在了这个法国小女孩身上。

2．现在是圣诞节，她的父母都很贫穷，

不能摆脱困境，

与贫穷的痛苦斗争着，

只为再次活着迎接夏天的到来。

3．没有礼物给皮克拉！他们非常悲伤

随着圣诞节清晨的来临！

他们的小宝贝不快乐；

圣诞老人没有东西带给她！

4．但皮克拉深信不疑

漂亮的东西会

在圣诞日赠给每个孩子，

所以她一直到天快亮才睡着。

5．当她最终醒来，信心满怀，

天空破晓，她偷拿来鞋子；

空气中都充满欢快的声音，

显然圣诞老人来过了。

6．匆忙的皮克拉，内心甜蜜又按捺不住——

从来没见过这么愉快的孩子——

“看看圣诞老人带来了什么！”她叫着，

妈妈和爸爸都往里面看去。

7．现在是我从未听过的故事了！

有一只颤抖的小鸟！

一只小麻雀，从窗子飞进来，

爬进了皮克拉的小鞋子！

8．“可怜的皮克拉一定是多么善良啊！”

她大声叫着，像女王一样欢乐，

饥饿的小麻雀被她喂饱了，温暖着，

她手舞足蹈地跳起舞来，多么高兴啊。

9．孩子们，我告诉你们的

关于可爱的皮克拉和她的小鸟的故事是真实的。

据说，在遥远的法国，

她们今天仍然健在。

LESSON 14

TRUE MANLINESS

真正的男子汉


1．"Please, mother, do sit down and let me try my hand," said Fred Liscom, a bright, active boy twelve years old. Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly(1) about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted.

2．She smiled, and said, "You, Fred, you wash dishes?" "Yes, indeed, mother," replied Fred;" I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me."

3．A look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking-chair. Fred washed the dishes, and put them in the closet. He then swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.

4．Fred's father was away from home, and as there was some cold meat in the pantry, Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.

5．He kept on in this way for two or three days, till his mother was able to resume her usual work, and he felt amply(2) rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, "Well, madam, it's my opinion(3) that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet."

6．The doctor did not know how the "quiet" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection.

7．Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school, and staying to play after it was dismissed.

8．The boys missed him, and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was "wanted at home. ""I'll tell you," said Tom Barton, "I'll find him out, boys—see if I don't!"

9．So he called for Fred to go to school, and on his way to the side door walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was absolutely(4) needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand.

10．Of course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess. "Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes. ""Girl boy!" "Pretty Bessie!" "Lost your apron, have n't you, Polly!"

11．Fred was not wanting either in spirit or courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent(5) these insults and to fight some of his tormentors. But his consciousness(6) of right and his love for his mother helped him.

12．While he was struggling for self mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, "Don't give up! Be really brave!" He knew the teacher had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.

13．The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted or teased in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said; and so the brave little boy had no farther trouble.



（Mrs. M. O. Johnson）



EXERCISES. —Why did Fred offer to wash the dishes? Was it a disgraceful thing to do? How was he rewarded? How did his schoolmates show their lack of manliness?





【中文阅读】


1．“妈妈，求您了，坐下吧，让我来试试。”弗雷德·利斯科姆说。他是一个阳光、活泼的12岁少年。利斯科姆夫人看起来苍白而疲惫，她没精打采地挪动着，打算收拾起她基本上没怎么吃的早餐。

2．她微笑着说：“弗雷德，你，你来洗盘子吗？”“是的，妈妈，”弗雷德回答道，“如果我看您刷盘子看了那么多次还没学会，那我肯定是个差劲的学生。就让我试试吧。”

3．当母亲坐到她的矮摇椅上时，脸上露出了如释重负的表情。弗雷德洗好盘子，将它们放到橱柜里。接着他又打扫了厨房，从地窖里拿上来一些土豆，把它们洗净，准备做晚餐用，然后就去上学了。

4．弗雷德的父亲不在家，家里的储藏室里还有些冻肉，利斯科姆夫人感觉准备晚餐还比较轻松。弗雷德从学校匆匆忙忙回到家，摆好餐具，饭后又刷了碗。

5．他如此执行了两到三天，直到他母亲能够继续她的日常工作。医生某天说道：“唉呀，女士，我认为如果前段时间您没有静养，很有可能会病得很重。”听了这些话，他感到自己得到了极大的褒奖。

6．医生当然不知道“静养”是如何得到保证的，也不知道听到他的话男孩的心是如何狂跳不止。

7．此外，他的脾气和耐心也经历了严峻的考验。过去，他总是习惯于早早到学校，下课后留在学校玩耍。

8．他的伙伴们都很想念他。当他对于“没法早到学校，没法下课后留下玩耍”给出原因仅仅是“家里需要他”时，伙伴们的好奇心被激发了起来。

“我会告诉你们的，”汤姆·巴顿说，“我会找到答案的，孩子们——看我会不会！”

9．于是他打电话约弗雷德一起上学。在往旁门走时，他轻手轻脚地接近厨房的窗户，这一动作绝对是有意为之而非出于需要。向屋内看去，他看见弗雷德站在餐桌边，手里拿着一块抹布。

10．当然，他到学校公布了看到的一切。课间时，可怜的弗雷德收到了各种各样的问候。“嗨，你真有勇气，能待在家刷盘子。”“娘娘腔！”“漂亮的小贝西！”“是不是围裙找不到啦，珀莉！”

11．弗雷德并不是缺乏志气或勇气，而且他对于这些侮辱性的话语表示出强烈的不满，也很有冲动和刺头们打上一架。但正是他的正义感和对母亲的爱帮了他。

12．正当他挣扎着控制自己的情绪时，老师出现在了教室门口。弗雷德与老师目光相对，虽然他的眼神没有说，但至少看起来是要说“不要放弃！要做到真正的坚强”！他知道老师已经听到了那些没头脑的同学们对他的侮辱和嘲笑了。

13．那天，男孩子们被告知，不许以任何方式嘲笑或取笑弗雷德。他们知道老师会说到做到的，所以勇敢的小男孩弗雷德没再遇到任何麻烦。

LESSON 15

TRUE MANLINESS (CONCLUDED)

真正的男子汉（结束篇）


1．"Fire! fire!" The cry crept out on the still night air, and the fire bells began to ring. Fred was wakened by the alarm and the red light streaming into his room. He dressed himself in a moment, almost, and tapped at the door of his mother's bedroom.

2．"It is Mr. Barton's house, mother. Do let me go," he said in eager, excited tones. Mrs. Liscom thought a moment. He was young, but she could trust him, and she knew how much his heart was in the request.

3．"Yes, you may go," she answered;" but be careful, my boy. If you can help, do so; but do nothing rashly. "Fred promised to follow her advice, and hurried to the fire.

4．Mr. and Mrs. Barton were not at home. The house had been left in charge of the servants. The fire spread with fearful speed, for there was a high wind, and it was found impossible to save the house. The servants ran about, screaming and lamenting, but doing nothing to any purpose.

5．Fred found Tom outside, in safety. "Where is Katy?" he asked. Tom, trembling with terror, seemed to have had no thought but of his own escape. He said, "Katy is in the house!" "In what room?" asked Fred. "In that one, "pointing to a window in the upper story.

6．It was no time for words, but for instant, vigorous action. The staircase was already on fire; there was but one way to reach Katy, and that full of danger. The second floor might fall at any moment, and Fred knew it. But he trusted in an arm stronger than his own, and silently sought help and guidance.

7．A ladder was quickly brought, and placed against the house. Fred mounted it, followed by the hired man, dashed in the sash of the window, and pushed his way into the room where the poor child lay nearly suffocated with smoke.



8．He roused her with some difficulty, carried her to the window, and placed her upon the sill. She was instantly grasped by strong arms, and carried down the ladder, Fred following as fast as possible. They had scarcely reached the ground before a crash of falling timbers told them that they had barely escaped with their lives.

9．Tom Barton never forgot the lesson of that night; and he came to believe, and to act upon the belief, in after years, that true manliness is in harmony with gentleness, kindness, and self-denial.



EXERCISES. —Relate the story of the fire. What is meant by " to any purpose," in paragraph four? Did Fred show any lack of manliness when tested? What does this lesson teach?

1．“着火啦！着火啦！”叫喊声划破了寂静的夜空，火灾报警铃声随之响起。报警声惊醒了弗雷德，红色的火光向着他的房间逼近。他立刻穿上衣服，几乎同时敲响了他母亲卧室的门。

2．“是巴顿家的房子着火了，妈妈。让我去帮忙吧。”他用急切而又激动的语气说道。利斯科姆夫人想了一下。虽然他年纪不大，但她相信他能行，而且她也知道他的请求是多么真心实意。

3．“好吧，你可以去，”她回答，“但一定要小心，我的孩子。如果你能帮上忙，那一定要帮；不过千万不要莽撞。”弗雷德保证会遵从母亲的建议，然后匆忙向火灾现场跑去。

4．巴顿夫妇不在家。房子留给佣人们照看。火势以令人恐惧的速度蔓延着，由于风力太大，想保住房子是不可能的了。佣人们纷纷叫嚷着、抱怨着，四散逃窜，任何想办法的事都没做。

5．弗雷德在外面找到了汤姆，他安然无恙。“凯蒂在哪儿？”弗雷德问。汤姆害怕得浑身发抖，看起来他只想着自己逃出来，其他的都顾不上了。汤姆说：“凯蒂在房子里！”“在哪间？”弗雷德问道。“就是那间。”汤姆指向了楼上的一扇窗户。

6．没时间多说了，得马上采取有力的行动。楼梯已经着火了。现在只有一条路能到凯蒂房间，而这条路却又异常危险。弗雷德知道，房子的二楼随时都有可能坍塌。但是他信任那些比他有力气的大人，然后轻声地向他们寻求帮助和指导。

7．人们很快拿来了一架梯子，把它搭在了房子外墙上。弗雷德爬上了梯子，雇来的人紧随其后，先后从窗框冲了进去。他立刻奔向凯蒂的房间，那个可怜的孩子在里面被浓烟呛得几乎要窒息了。

8．他费力地叫醒凯蒂，将她抱到窗边，放在窗台上。她随即被一双强有力的胳膊紧紧抓住并抱下了梯子。弗雷德以最快的速度紧跟其后。他们刚一站到地面上就听到了木头掉落的撞击声，这说明刚才他们差点就没机会逃命了。

9．汤姆·巴顿永远也忘不了那天夜里的一课。在之后的岁月里，他开始相信并且用行动实践这一信念，即真正的男子汉是温柔、善良和自我牺牲的统一。





LESSON 16

THE BROWN THRUSH

棕色画眉鸟


Lucy Larcom, the author of the following poem, was born in 1826, and passed many years of her life as a factory girl at Lowell, Mass. She died in 1893.

1．There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;

" He's singing to me! he's singing to me!"

And what does he say, little girl, little boy?

"Oh, the world's running over with joy!

Don't You hear? Don't you see?

Hush! look! In my tree

I'm as happy as happy can be!"

2．And the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see,

And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?

Don't meddle! don't touch! little girl, little boy,

Or the world will lose some of its joy!

Now I'm glad! now I'm free!

And I always shall be,

If you never bring sorrow to me."

3．So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,

To you and to me, to you and to me;

And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,

"Oh, the world's running over with joy!

But long it won't be,

Don't you know?

Don't you see?

Unless we're as good as can be."



EXERCISES. —What is a thrush? Why was the thrush so happy? Do you think he would have been happy if the little boy or girl had robbed the nest?

下面这首诗歌的作者露西·拉科姆，生于1826年，很长一段时间曾作为一名工厂女工在马萨诸塞州的罗维尔市生活，1893年去世。

1．一只欢乐的棕色画眉鸟坐在树枝上；

“他在对我歌唱！他在对我歌唱！”

小女孩，小男孩，他在说什么？

“哦，世界将一直充满欢乐！

难道你听不见？难道你看不出？

安静！看呐！在我的树上

我要多快乐有多快乐！”

2．棕色画眉一直在唱着，“你看到鸟巢了么？

看到被我藏在杜松树上的五颗蛋了么？

别捣乱！别碰！小女孩，小男孩，

否则世界将会失去一些欢乐！

现在我非常高兴！现在我很自由！

而且我会一直这样

只要你们不给我带来悲伤。”

3．所以欢乐的棕色画眉总在树上歌唱，

向着你和我，向着我和你；

他整天都在唱，小女孩，小男孩，

“哦，世界将一直充满欢乐！

但这并不长久

难道你不知道？难道你看不出？

除非我们能做多好就做多好。”





LESSON 17

A SHIP IN A STORM

暴风雨中的船


1．Did you ever go far out upon the great ocean? How beautiful it is to be out at sea, when the sea is smooth and still!

2．Let a storm approach, and the scene is changed. The heavy, black clouds appear in the distance, and throw a deep, deathlike shade over the world of waters.

3．The captain and sailors soon see in the clouds the signs of evil. All hands are then set to work to take in sail.

4．The hoarse notes of the captain, speaking through his trumpet, are echoed(1) from lip to lip among the rigging. Happy will it be, if all is made snug before the gale(2) strikes the vessel.

5．At last, the gale comes like a vast moving mountain of air. It strikes the ship. The vessel heaves(3) and groans under the dreadful weight, and struggles to escape through the foaming waters.

6．If she is far out at sea, she will be likely to ride out the storm in safety. But if the wind is driving her upon the shore, the poor sailors will hardly escape being dashed upon the rocks, and drowned.

7．Once there was a ship in a storm. Some of her masts were already broken, and her sails lost. While the wind was raging, and the billows(4) were dashing against her, the cry was heard, "A man has fallen overboard!"

8．Quickly was the boat lowered, and she was soon seen bounding on her way over the mountain waves. At one moment, the boat seemed lifted to the skies, and the next, it sank down, and appeared to be lost beneath the waves!



9．At length, the man was found. He was well nigh drowned; but he was taken on board, and now they made for the ship. But the ship rolled so dreadfully, that it seemed certain death to go near her. And now, what should they do?

10．The captain told one of the men to go aloft and throw down a rope. This was made fast to the boat, and when the sea was somewhat calm it was hoisted, and all fell down into the ship with a dreadful crash. It was a desperate(5) way of getting on board; but fortunately no lives were lost.

11．On the dangerous points along our seacoast are lighthouses, which can be seen far out at sea, and serve as guides to ships. Sometimes the fog(6) is so dense that these lights can not be seen, but most lighthouses have great fog bells or fog horns; some of the latter are made to sound by steam, and can be heard for a long distance. These bells and horns are kept sounding as long as the fog lasts.

12．There are also many life-saving stations along the coast where trained men are ready with lifeboats. "When a ship is driven ashore they at once go to the rescue of those on board, and thus many valuable lives are saved.

13．Take it all in all, a sailor's life is a very hard one. Our young friends owe a debt of gratitude(7) to those whose home is upon the great waters, and who bring them the luxuries(8) of other countries.



EXERCISES. —What is this lesson about? When is it dangerous to be at sea? What do sailors then do? In what situation are they most likely to be saved? Relate the story of the man overboard. Tell about the lighthouses. How are vessels warned of danger in a fog? What about the life-saving stations? What is said of a sailor's life?





【中文阅读】


1．你是否曾经在大海里远航？当风平浪静的时候，海面上是多么漂亮啊！

2．若让暴风雨接近，场景就完全变了样。厚重的乌云在不远处出现，给这个水的世界投下一个颜色很深的、死亡般的阴影。

3．船长和水手们很快在乌云中看到了不祥的迹象。所有人手都被派去把船帆收起来。

4．船长对着扩音器广播着，他沙哑的语调在帆索边忙碌的水手们口中重复回响着。如果能在一阵猛烈的海风袭击船身之前将一切都准备妥当，大家都会很高兴地松口气。

5．最后，海风来了，像一座巨大的移动着的空气山，向船袭来。惊人的重量使得船身不断地上下起伏，发出咯吱咯吱的声音。轮船挣扎着想要从冒着泡沫的水里逃开。

6．如果它远航在海里，很有可能经历暴风雨后安然无恙。但若是强风把它吹向了岸边，可怜的水手们将很难逃脱撞上岩石，溺水身亡的命运。

7．曾经有一艘船在海上遇到了风暴，它的桅杆有些已经折断，船帆也不知去向。这时候，狂风呼啸着袭来，巨浪不断地拍打船身，只听一个声音喊道：“有人从船上落水啦！”

8．人们迅速从大船上放下一只小船，它很快就在如山般的巨浪里颠簸前进。在这一刻，小船仿佛被举到了天上，而下一刻，它又沉了下去，好似消失在了巨浪下面。

9．最后终于找到了落水的人，他几乎快要被淹死了，人们把他抬上小船。现在他们开始启程返回大船。可这时大船摇摆得异常剧烈，看起来只要接近它就会必死无疑。此时此刻，他们该怎么办呢？

10．船长告诉其中一名船员，让他站到高处往下扔条绳子。绳子的一端被牢牢系在小船上，当海面稍微平静时，把小船用绳子提了起来。随着一声巨大的撞击声，连船带人一起落在了大船上。这是一种不顾一切的收船方式，所幸没有任何的人员伤亡。

11．沿着海边的险要地点设有灯塔，从海上很远的地方就能看到，它们是船只的路标。有时候，雾霾太过浓重，从远处看不到灯塔发出的光，但大多数灯塔都备有很大的雾钟或雾笛，有些雾笛的声音是蒸汽机发出的，从很远的地方就能听得到。只要雾霾持续，这些雾钟或雾笛就会一直响着。

12．在海边，经常遇到训练有素的人员准备救生艇进行救援的情况。“当一艘船靠岸时，他们立刻冲上船去营救甲板上的人员，拯救了许多宝贵的生命。”

13．因此，总体来说，海员的生活是非常艰险的。我们年轻的朋友们确实应该感激那些常年漂在海上，以船为家的人们，是他们给我们带来了外国的好东西。

LESSON 18

THE SAILOR'S CONSOLATION

水手的慰藉


Charles Dibdin, the author, was born at Southampton, England, in 1745. He wrote a number of fine sea songs. He died in 1814.

1．One night came on a hurricane(1),

The sea was mountains rolling,

When Barney Buntline turned his quid(2),

And said to Billy Bowling:

"A strong norwester's blowing, Bill;

Hark! don't ye hear it roar now?

Lord help 'em, how I pities all

Unhappy folks on shore now!

2．"Foolhardy(3) chaps who live in town,

What danger they are all in,

And now are quaking(4) in their beds,

For fear the roof shall fall in:

Poor creatures, how they envy us,

And wish, as I've a notion(5),

For our good luck, in such a storm,

To be upon the ocean.

3．"But as for them who're out all day,

On business from their houses,

And late at night are coming home,

To cheer the babes and spouses(6);

While you and I, Bill, on the deck,

Are comfortably lying,

My eyes! what tiles(7) and chimney pots(8)

About their heads are flying!

4. "And very often have we heard

How men are killed and undone(9)

By overturns of carriages,

By thieves, and fires in London.

We know what risks all landsmen run,

From noblemen to tailors;

Then, Bill, let us thank Providence

That you and I are sailors."

作者查尔斯·迪布丁1745年生于英格兰南安普敦市。他写作了大量脍炙人口的关于大海的歌曲，于1814年去世。

1．一天夜里，飓风袭来，

大海像摇摆的高山，

巴尼·邦特莱恩咀嚼着烟草

和比利·鲍灵说着话，

“比尔，正在刮着强西北风；

听！现在你听到它咆哮没有？

愿上帝保佑他们，我真为那些正在岸上的人们

感到惋惜！”

2．“有勇无谋的家伙们住在镇上，

他们经历过什么险境，

现在正在他们的床上瑟瑟发抖，

担心屋顶会掉下来；

可怜的人们，他们多么羡慕我们，

我这样想，他们会

祝愿我们在这样的风暴中，行进在海上，

能有好运气。”

3．“但对于每天外出工作的人来说，

从他们的家里外出工作，

晚上很晚才回家。

还要哄哄孩子和妻子；

比尔，当我和你在甲板上，

舒舒服服地躺着，

我的眼睛看到了什么！砖瓦和烟囱帽

都在他们头上飞啊！”

4．“而且我们常听说

人们是怎样被倾覆的马车

伦敦的抢劫和大火

夺去生命，灰飞烟灭。

我们知道住在岸上的人们

从贵族到海员，

面对着怎样的风险，

那么，比尔，谢天谢地，

你和我是海员。”

LESSON 19

TWO WAYS OF TELLING A STORY

两种方式讲述同一个故事




1．In one of the most populous(1) cities of New England, a few years ago, a party of lads, all members of the same school, got up a grand sleigh ride. The sleigh was a very large one, drawn by six gray horses.

2．On the following day, as the teacher entered the schoolroom, he found his pupils in high glee, as they chattered about the fun and frolic of their excursion(2). In answer to some inquiries, one of the lads gave him an account of their trip and its various incidents(3).

3．As he drew near the end of his story, he exclaimed: "Oh, sir! there was one thing I had almost forgotten. As we were coming home, we saw ahead of us a queer looking affair in the road. It proved to be a rusty old sleigh, fastened behind a covered wagon, proceeding at a very slow rate, and taking up the whole road.

4．"Finding that the owner was not disposed to turn out, we determined upon a volley of snowballs and a good hurrah. They produced the right effect, for the crazy machine turned out into the deep snow, and the skinny old pony started on a full trot.

5．"As we passed, some one gave the horse a good crack, which made him run faster than he ever did before, I'll warrant(4).

6．"With that, an old fellow in the wagon, who was buried up under an old hat, bawled out, 'Why do you frighten my horse?' 'Why don't you turn out, then?' says the driver. So we gave him three rousing cheers more. His horse was frightened again, and ran up against a loaded wagon, and, I believe, almost capsized(5) the old creature—and so we left him."

7．"Well, boys," replied the teacher, "take your seats, and I will tell you a story, and all about a sleigh ride, too. Yesterday afternoon a very venerable(6) old clergyman was on his way from Boston to Salem, to pass the rest of the winter at the house of his son. That he might be prepared for journeying in the following spring he took with him his wagon, and for the winter his sleigh, which he fastened behind the wagon.

8．"His sight and hearing were somewhat blunted(7) by age, and he was proceeding very slowly; for his horse was old and feeble, like his owner. He was suddenly disturbed by loud hurrahs from behind, and by a furious pelting of balls of snow and ice upon the top of his wagon.

9．"In his alarm he dropped his reins, and his horse began to run away. In the midst of the old man's trouble, there rushed by him, with loud shouts, a large party of boys, in a sleigh drawn by six horses. 'Turn out! turn out, old fellow!' 'Give us the road!' 'What will you take for your pony?' 'What's the price of oats, old man?' were the various cries that met his ears.

10．"'Pray, do not frighten my horse!' exclaimed the infirm driver. 'Turn out, then! turn out!' was the answer, which was followed by repeated cracks and blows from the long whip of the 'grand sleigh,' with showers of snowballs, and three tremendous hurrahs from the boys.

11．"The terror of the old man and his horse was increased, and the latter ran away with him, to the great danger of his life. He contrived, however, to stop his horse just in season to prevent his being dashed against a loaded wagon. A short distance brought him to the house of his son. That son, boys, is your instructor, and that 'old fellow,' was your teacher's father!"

12．When the boys perceived how rude and unkind their conduct appeared from another point of view, they were very much ashamed of their thoughtlessness, and most of them had the manliness to apologize to their teacher for what they had done.



(Henry K. Oliver)



EXERCISES.—Repeat the boys' story of the sleigh ride. The teacher's story. Were the boys ill-natured or only thoughtless? Is thoughtlessness any excuse for rudeness or unkindness?

1．几年前，在新英格兰一个人口稠密的城市里，一群小伙子坐上了一辆大雪橇，他们都是来自同一个学校的学生。雪橇体积非常庞大，由六匹灰色的骏马拉着。

2．第二天，老师走进教室，发现他的学生们都异常兴奋，还在谈论着前一天出行的逸闻趣事。为回答老师的询问，其中一个小伙子给他描述了他们的行程和一些小插曲。

3．当他快讲完时，忽然大声说道：“对了，先生！我差点忘了一件事。我们快到家时，看见前面路上有个非常奇怪的东西。后来证实那是一个锈迹斑斑的旧雪橇，被绑在了一辆有篷马车后面，行进速度特别慢，把整条路都挡住了。”

4．“发现马车的主人并没有让路的打算，我们决定一起朝他扔雪球，一起大叫起哄。这些确实起了作用，那辆不正常的马车陷在了厚厚的积雪里，那匹干瘦的老马开始小跑起来。”

5．“当我们赶超前面马车时，有人朝那匹马打了个响指，使得它比之前任何时候跑得都快，我敢保证。”

6．“马车里坐着一名老者，整个脸几乎都掩藏在一顶旧礼帽下。这样一来，他高声斥责道：‘你们为什么吓唬我的马？’‘那你为什么不让开路？’后面的驾驶员说道。所以我们又给他起了三次哄。他的马又受到了惊吓，朝着一辆满载货物的马车冲了过去。我想肯定把那个老头弄翻了——然后我们就驾车走远了。”

7．“好了，孩子们，”老师回答道，“你们都坐下吧”，我来给你们讲个故事，也是关于一次雪橇出行的。昨天下午，一位非常德高望重的老牧师从波士顿赶往塞伦，去他儿子家过冬。为了准备明年春天的旅行，所以他驾驶着自己的马车，同时为了适应冬季的需要，还带上了雪橇，并把它绑在了马车后边。

8．“岁月的风霜使他的视力和听力都变得不再敏锐，他走得非常缓慢，因为他的马和主人一样，已经年老体衰。突然间，吵闹的叫嚷声、猛烈的雪球和冰块击打马车顶篷的声音从后面传来，惊扰了老人家。”

9．一阵惊慌间，缰绳脱手了，他的马开始乱跑。就在老人家陷入困境时，一群男孩子乘坐着六匹马的雪橇从他身后急速冲过来，大声喊着‘靠边！靠边，老家伙！’‘给我们让路！’‘你花多少钱买的小马啊？’‘麦子多少钱啊，老头子？’，类似的叫喊声传到了他的车里。

10．‘请不要吓到我的马！’年迈的车夫叫道。得到的回答却是‘那就靠边！靠边！’，接着是‘大雪橇’上的长鞭发出的不断抽打的声音，一阵阵的雪球如雨点般砸过来，男孩子们大喊了三声。

11．“老人家和他的马受到了更大的惊吓，马儿带着他不停地奔跑，给他的生命带来了极大危险。但是他设法让马停下来，避免了撞上一辆满载货物的马车。离那里不远的地方就是他儿子的住处了。孩子们，那个儿子，就是你们的老师，而那个‘老家伙’正是你们老师的父亲！”

12．当意识到他们的行为从另一个角度看来是多么粗鲁和冷酷时，孩子们都为自己的无所顾忌感到羞愧。他们中的大多数人都很有担当地去找老师道了歉。

LESSON 20

FREAKS OF THE FROST

霜之奇想


By Hannah Flagg Gould, who was born at Lancaster, Vermont, in 1789. She published several volumes of poems (one for children) and one collection of prose articles, entitled "Gathered Leaves." She died in 1865.

1．The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,

And whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight;

So through the valley and over the height

In silence I'll take my way;

I will not go on, like that blustering(1) train,

The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,

Who make so much bustle(2) and noise in vain,

But I'll be as busy as they."

2．Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest(3);

He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed

In diamond beads; and over the breast

Of the quivering(4) lake, he spread

A coat of mail, that it need not fear

The downward point of many a spear,

That he hung on its margin(5), far and near,

Where a rock could rear its head.

3．He went to the windows of those who slept,

And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;

Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,

By the light of the morn were seen

Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;

There were bevies(6) of birds, and swarms of bees;

There were cities with temples and towers, and these

All pictured(7) in silver sheen(8).

4．But he did one thing that was hardly fair;

He peeped in the cupboard, and, finding there

That all had forgotten for him to prepare,

"Now just to set them a-thinking,

I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,

"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three;

And the glass of water they've left for me

Shall 'tchick!' to tell them I'm drinking."



EXERCISES.—What did the frost say? What did he do to the mountain? The trees? The lake? What is a "coat of mail"? What did he do to the window? The pitcher?

1．霜看到一个平静而晴朗的夜晚，

低语道：“现在我要淡出人们视野；

穿过河谷，越过高山，

我会悄悄地出发；

我不会像呼啸的火车那般前行，

风和雪、雹和雨，

枉费了制造出的那么多喧嚣与噪音，

但我会和他们一样繁忙不已。

2．然后他飞到山边，给山峰打上了粉；

他落在树上，给树枝穿上了

钻石般的珠子；在胸膛般起伏的湖面上，

他展开一幅铠甲，再不需要担心

长矛的戳戳点点，

在石头裸露在外的地方，

他将四周全部包裹。

3．他还光顾了人们熟睡的窗子，

在每块窗格玻璃上，像精灵般慢慢爬行；

无论他在哪里呼吸，无论他在哪里踏足，

伴随着黎明的光线看到，

最美丽的东西；那些花和树，

成群的鸟儿和蜜蜂；

拥有神庙和高塔的城市；

这些全都披上了银白的光泽。

4．但他还做了一件不那么公允的事；

他向碗橱中窥望，发现那里

所有东西都忘记为他准备了，

“现在就让他们想一想，

我把这筐水果咬了，”他说道，

“这个价值不菲的水罐我要闯三闯；

这杯他们留给我的水

会发出‘乞’的声音，告诉他们我正喝着。”

LESSON 21

WASTE NOT, WANT NOT

不浪费，不愁缺


1．Mr. Jones. Boys, if you have nothing to do, will you unpack these parcels for me?

2．The two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with good whipcord. Ben took his parcel to the table, and began to examine(1) the knot, and then to untie it.

3．John took the other parcel, and tried first at one corner, and then at the other, to pull off the string. But the cord had been too well secured, and he only drew the knots tighter.

4．John. I wish these people would not tie up their parcels so tightly, as if they were never to be undone. Why, Ben, how did you get yours undone? What is in your parcel? I wonder what is in mine! I wish I could get the string off. I will cut it.

5．Ben. Oh, no, do not cut it, John! Look, what a nice cord this is, and yours is the same. It is a pity to cut it.

6．John. Pooh! what signifies(2) a bit of pack thread?

7．Ben. It is whipcord.

8．John. Well, whipcord then! what signifies a bit of whipcord? You can get a piece of whipcord twice as long as that for three cents; and who cares for three cents? Not I, for one. So, here it goes.

9．So he took out his knife, and cut it in several places.

10．Mr. Jones. Well, my boys, have you undone the parcels for me?

11．John. Yes, sir; here is the parcel.

12．Ben. And here is my parcel, father, and here is also the string.

13．Mr. Jones. You may keep the string, Ben.

14．Ben. Thank you, sir. What excellent whipcord it is!

15．Mr. Jones. And you, John, may keep your string, too, if it will be of any use to you.

16．John. It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir.

17．Mr. Jones. No, I am afraid not, if this is it.

18．A few weeks after this, Mr. Jones gave each of his sons a new top.

19．John. How is this, Ben? These tops have no strings. What shall we do for strings?

20．Ben. I have a string that will do very well for mine. And he pulled it out of his pocket.

21．John. Why, if that is not the whipcord! I wish I had saved mine.

22．A few days afterward, there was a shooting match, with bows and arrows, among the lads. The prize was a fine bow and arrows, to be given to the best marksman(3). "Come, come," said Master Sharp, "I am within one inch of the mark. I should like to see who will go nearer."

23．John drew his bow, and shot. The arrow struck within a quarter of an inch of Master Sharp's. "Shoot away," said Sharp; "but you must understand the rules. We settled them before you came. You are to have three shots with your own arrows. Nobody is to borrow or lend. So shoot away."

24．John seized his second arrow; "If I have any luck," said he;—but just as he pronounced the word "luck," the string broke, and the arrow fell from his hands.

25．Master Sharp. There! It is all over with you.

26．Ben. Here is my bow for him, and welcome.

27．Master Sharp. No, no, sir; that is not fair. Did you not hear the rules? There is to be no lending.

28．It was now Ben's turn to make his trial. His first arrow missed the mark; the second was exactly as near as John's first. Before venturing the last arrow, Ben very prudently(4) examined the string of his bow; and, as he pulled it to try its strength, it snapped.

29．Master Sharp clapped his hands and danced for joy. But his dancing suddenly ceased(5), when careful Ben drew out of his pocket an excellent piece of cord, and began to tie it to the bow.

30．"The everlasting(6) whipcord, I declare!" cried John. "Yes," said Ben, "I put it in my pocket today, because I thought I might want it."

31．Ben's last arrow won the prize; and when the bow and arrows were handed to him, John said, "How valuable that whipcord has been to you, Ben. I'll take care how I waste anything hereafter."



EXERCISES.—What is this lesson designed to teach? Which of the boys preserved his whipcord? What good did it do him? What did the other boy do with his? What was the consequence? What did he learn from it?

1．琼斯先生：小伙子们，如果你们没什么事做，能不能请你们给我打开这些包裹？

2．两个包裹一模一样，都系着上好的鞭绳。本将他手里的包裹放在桌子上，开始检查绳结，然后把它解开了。

3．约翰拿着另外一个包裹，最开始试图从一角解起，后来又换到从另一边拉绳子。但是鞭绳系得太牢固了，他反而是把绳结越拉越紧。

4．约翰：我真希望这些人不要把他们的包裹系得这么紧，就像永远不打开似的。本，你是怎么解开你那个包裹的？你包裹里是什么？我在想我这里有什么。我真希望能把绳子弄开。我来剪开它。

5．本：哦，不，约翰，别剪！看，这是一条多好的绳子，你的那条也一样好。剪断太可惜了。

6．约翰：哎呀！一小截线段有什么大不了的？

7．本：这可是鞭绳啊。

8．约翰：好吧，鞭绳就鞭绳！一小截鞭绳有什么用？三美分就能买条相当于这个两倍长的鞭绳。谁会在乎三美分啊？比如我就不在乎。那么，现在开始。

9．于是他拿出小刀，将绳子剪成了几截。

10．琼斯先生：好了，孩子们，你们把包裹给我打开了吗？

11．约翰：是的。包裹在这儿。

12．本：爸爸，这是我打开的包裹，绳子在这儿。

13．琼斯先生：本，绳子你可以留下。

14．本：谢谢您！多好的鞭绳啊！

15．琼斯先生：约翰，如果你的那条绳子对你有用，你也可以留着。

16．约翰：它对我来说没什么用处，谢谢您。

17．琼斯先生：不，如果是剪成这样的，恐怕确实没用了。

18．几周之后，琼斯先生给他的两个儿子每人一只陀螺。

19．约翰：这个怎么玩，本？这两个陀螺没有鞭子。我们拿什么当鞭子啊？

20．本：我有一条非常合适的绳子。然后他从口袋里拿了出来。

21．约翰：哦，这不是那条鞭绳嘛！我希望当时完整地留下了我的那条。

22．之后又过了几天，有一场射箭比赛，参赛的小伙子们手里都拿着弓和箭。比赛的奖品是一副上好的弓箭，会奖励给最优秀的神箭手。“来吧，来吧，”夏普大师说，“我射出的箭落在了距靶心一英尺内。我要看看谁会射得更接近靶心。”

23．约翰拿起他的弓，开始射箭。他的箭射到了离夏普大师的落点1/4英尺的地方。“再射一次，”夏普说，“但是你们一定要知道规则。我们在你们来之前就已经射完了。你可以用你自己的箭瞄射三次，任何人不许借用或出借自己的弓箭。好了，再射一次。”

24．约翰拿起他的第二支箭。“但愿我运气好点，”他说。但是，就在他说出“运气”这个词的时候，他的弓弦断了，箭从他手中掉落。

25．夏普大师：啊！你的比赛结束了。

26．本：拿我的弓给他，来吧。

27．夏普先生：不，不，先生，这不公平。你刚才听到规则了吗？不允许借弓箭。

28．现在轮到本来试试身手了。他的第一箭脱靶了，没射中；第二箭射得和约翰的第一箭不相上下。在大胆射出最后一支箭之前，本小心翼翼地检查他的弓弦，就在他把弓张开准备试试它的弦是否绷紧时，弓弦啪地断了。

29．夏普大师拍拍手，高兴得跳起舞来。但他的舞蹈突然停下了，细心的本从口袋里拿出一条上好的鞭绳，开始将它绑在弓上。

30．“我知道，那是不朽的鞭绳！”约翰叫道。“是的，”本说，“我今天把它放在口袋里，因为我想我没准会需要它。”

31．本的最后一箭赢得了奖品。当把弓箭递到他手上时，约翰说：“本，那条鞭绳对你来说可是太珍贵了。将来我要是再想浪费东西可要当心了。”

LESSON 22

JEANNETTE AND JO

珍妮特和乔


By Mary Mapes Dodge, who was born in New York City in 1838. She is the editor of the "St. Nicholas" magazine, and has written many stories for children.

1．Two girls I know—Jeannette and Jo,

And one is always moping;

The other lassie, come what may,

Is ever bravely hoping.

2．Beauty of face and girlish grace

Are theirs, for joy or sorrow;

Jeannette takes brightly every day,

And Jo dreads each to-morrow.

3．One early morn they watched the dawn—

I saw them stand together;

Their whole day's sport, 't was very plain,

Depended on the weather.

4．"'T will storm!" cried Jo. Jeannette spoke low:

"Yes, but 't will soon be over."

And, as she spoke, the sudden shower

Came, beating down the clover.

5．"I told you so!" cried angry Jo:

"It always is a-raining!"

Then hid her face in dire despair,

Lamenting and complaining.

6．But sweet Jeannette, quite hopeful yet,—

I tell it to her honor,—

Looked up and waited till the sun

Came streaming in upon her.

7．The broken clouds sailed off in crowds,

Across a sea of glory.

Jeannette and Jo ran, laughing, in—

Which ends my simple story.

8．Joy is divine. Come storm, come shine,

The hopeful are the gladdest;

And doubt and dread, children, believe

Of all things are the saddest.

9．In morning's light, let youth be bright;

Take in the sunshine tender;

Then, at the close, shall life's decline

Be full of sunset splendor.

10．And ye who fret, try, like Jeannette,

To shun all weak complaining;

And not, like Jo, cry out too soon—

"It always is a-raining!"

玛丽·梅普斯·道奇著。玛丽1838年生于纽约市，曾任《圣尼古拉斯》杂志编辑，写作过很多儿童故事。

1．我认识的两个女孩——珍妮特和乔，

其中一个总是愁眉苦脸；

另一个小姑娘，无论发生没什么，

永远是坚强地忙碌着。

2．无论快乐或悲伤，

她们都拥有美丽的面庞和纯真的姿态；

珍妮特每天都过得神采奕奕，

而乔对明天总是唉声叹气。

3．一天清晨，她们看着黎明的到来，

我看见她们站在一起；

她们整天的活动，

完完全全，要视天气而定。

4．“暴风雨要来了！”乔大声喊道。珍妮特低声说：

“是啊，但是一会儿就停了。”

她正说着，突然间暴雨袭来，

压弯了三叶草。

5．“我告诉过你吧！”愤怒的乔大声叫道。

“肯定会下雨的！”

然后掩藏起脸上极度绝望的神情，

不住地痛惜和抱怨着。

6．但是可爱的珍妮特，仍然充满希望——

我能看得出来——

她仰起头等待着，直到太阳出来

照耀在她身上。

7．阴晴不定的云彩成堆地漂移开去，

越过了壮丽的大海。

珍妮特和乔欢笑着奔跑起来，

我叙述的简单故事也到此结束了。

8．快乐是上天的恩赐。来吧，暴风雨，来吧，太阳光，

永怀希望之心将是最快乐的；

孩子们，怀疑和忧虑的思想认为

一切都是最糟糕的。

9．在清晨的时光中，让青春明亮耀眼；

吸纳温和的阳光；

在行将告别之际，生命的谢幕

将充满落日的光辉。

10．烦恼的人们，试着像珍妮特一样吧，

规避所有无力的抱怨；

并且不要像乔那样，太急于大声叫喊——

“肯定会下雨的！”





LESSON 23

THE LION

狮 子


1．The lion is often called the "king of beasts." His height varies from three to four feet, and he is from six to nine feet long. His coat is of a yellowish brown or tawny color, and about his neck is a great shaggy mane which gives his head a majestic(1) appearance.

2．The strength of the lion is so great that he can easily crush the skulls of such animals as the horse or ox with one blow of his paw. No one who has not seen the teeth of a full grown lion taken out of their sockets can have any idea of their real size; one of them forms a good handful, and might easily be mistaken for a small elephant's tooth.

3．The home of the lion is in the forests of Asia and Africa, where he is a terror to man and beast. He generally lies concealed during the day, but as darkness comes on he prowls(2) about where other animals are accustomed to go for food or drink, and springs upon them unawares(3), with a roar that sounds like the rumble(4) of thunder.



4．The lion sometimes lives to a great age. One by the name of Pompey died at London, in the year 1760, at the age of seventy years. If taken when young the lion can be tamed, and will even show marks of kindness to his keeper.

5．In a menagerie(5) at Brussels, there was a cell where a large lion, called Danco, used to be kept. The cell happened to be in need of repair, and the keeper, whose name was William, desired a carpenter to come and mend it. The carpenter came, but was so afraid of the lion, that he would not go near the cell alone.

6．So William entered the cell, and led the lion to the upper part of it, while the other part was refitting(6). He played with the lion for some time; but, at last, being wearied, both he and the lion fell asleep. The carpenter went on with his work, and when he had finished he called out for William to come and see it.

7．He called again and again, but no William answered. The poor carpenter began to be frightened, lest the lion had made his dinner of the keeper, or else crushed him with his great paws. He crept round to the upper part of the cell, and there, looking through the railing, he saw the lion and William sleeping side by side as contentedly as two little brothers.

8．He was so astonished that he uttered a loud cry. The lion, awakened by the noise, stared at the carpenter with an eye of fury, and then placing his paw on the breast of his keeper, as if to say, "Touch him if you dare," the heroic(7) beast lay down to sleep again. The carpenter was dreadfully alarmed, and, not knowing how he could rouse William, he ran out and related what he had seen.

9．Some people came, and, opening the door of the cell, contrived to awaken the keeper, who, rubbing his eyes, quietly looked around him, and expressed himself very well satisfied with his nap. He took the lion's paw, shook it kindly, and then retired uninjured from the cell.



EXERCISES.—Describe the lion's appearance. What is said of his strength? His teeth? Describe the lion's home and habits. To what age do lions live? Can they be tamed? Relate the story about the lion Danco.





【中文阅读】


1．狮子通常被称作“百兽之王”，身高从三英尺到四英尺不等，身长六至九英尺，皮肤呈黄棕色或黄褐色。它的颈部周围有一圈蓬松的鬃毛，使它的头部看起来雄壮威武。

2．狮子的力量非常大，以至于它能够用爪子一挥轻而易举地击碎马或牛等动物的头骨。没有见过一头成年狮子的牙齿被从齿槽中拔出的人是不会了解它们实际的体型大小的。其中一个非常巨大，很容易被误认为是小象的牙齿。

3．狮子的家在亚洲和非洲的森林里，在那里，人类和野兽对他充满畏惧。一般来说，白天它都会躲藏起来，但随着夜幕降临，它会悄悄地踱到其他动物惯于觅食或饮水的地方，趁它们毫无察觉时跳出来，发出一声如雷般的吼声。

4．有时候，狮子可以活到很大年龄。一头名叫庞培的狮子于1760年死在伦敦，终年70岁。如果捕捉幼年时期的狮子，可以进行驯养，它甚至会对主人表现得很友好。

5．在布鲁塞尔的一家动物园，一个小笼子里关着一头名叫丹科的大狮子。笼子恰好需要维修，动物园的管理员威廉想要请一名木匠来修理它。木匠来了，但是因为太害怕狮子，不敢独自一人靠近笼子。

6．所以威廉走进笼子里，将狮子引导到上部，这时开始维修笼子的其他地方。他和狮子玩耍了一会儿，但最后由于疲倦，他和狮子都睡着了。木匠继续着他的工作，当全部完工时，他叫威廉来看一看。

7．他叫了一遍又一遍，但都没有威廉的回答声。可怜的木匠开始害怕起来，担心狮子已经把管理员当作晚餐了，或者用它巨大的爪子将管理员碾碎了。他匍匐着爬到笼子内部，在那儿透过栏杆看到狮子和威廉心满意足地并排睡在一起，像极了两个小兄弟。

8．木匠大惊失色，不小心大叫了一声。狮子被噪音吵醒，满眼怒火地瞪着他，将爪子搭在管理员的胸口上，仿佛在说“看你敢碰他”。这个鲁莽的野兽随后又躺下去继续睡觉。木匠感到非常震惊，不知怎样能叫醒威廉，他跑了出去，讲述了刚才看到的一切。

9．一些人赶过来，打开笼门，设法叫醒了管理员。他揉了揉眼睛，静静地看了看四周，表示对刚才的小憩非常满意。然后他抓住狮子的爪子，友好地和它握了握手，毫发无损地从笼子里退了出来。

LESSON 24

STRAWBERRIES

草　莓


By John Townsend Trowbridge, who was born at Ogden, N. Y., in 1827. He is a well-known author, and has written much for children both in poetry and prose.

1．Little Pearl Honeydew, six years old,

From her bright ear parted the curls of gold;

And laid her head on the strawberry bed,

To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.

2．Their cheeks were blushing, their breath was sweet,

She could almost hear their little hearts beat;

And the tiniest, lisping, whispering sound

That ever you heard, came up from the ground.

3．"Little friends," she said, "I wish I knew

How it is you thrive(1) on sun and dew!"

And this is the story the berries told

To little Pearl Honeydew, six years old.

4．"You wish you knew? And so do we.

But we can't tell you, unless it be

That the same Kind Power that cares for you

Takes care of poor little berries, too.

5．"Tucked up snugly, and nestled(2) below

Our coverlid of wind-woven snow,

We peep and listen, all winter long,

For the first spring day and the bluebird's song.

6．"When the swallows fly home to the old brown shed,

And the robins build on the bough overhead,

Then out from the mold(3), from the darkness and cold,

Blossom and runner(4) and leaf unfold.

7．"Good children, then, if they come near,

And hearken a good long while, may hear

A wonderful tramping of little feet,—

So fast we grow in the summer heat.

8．"Our clocks are the flowers; and they count the hours

Till we can mellow(5) in suns and showers,

With warmth of the west wind and heat of the south,

A ripe red berry for a ripe red month.

9．"Apple blooms whiten, and peach blooms fall,

And roses are gay by the garden wall,

Ere the daisy's dial(6) gives the sign

That we may invite little Pearl to dine.

10．"The days are longest, the month is June,

The year is nearing its golden noon,

The weather is fine, and our feast(7) is spread

With a green cloth and berries red.

11．"Just take us betwixt your finger and thumb,——

And quick, oh, quick! for, see! there come

Tom on all fours, and Martin the man,

And Margaret, picking as fast as they can.

12．"Oh, dear! if you only knew how it shocks

Nice berries like us to be sold by the box,

And eaten by strangers, and paid for with pelf(8),

You would surely take pity, and eat us yourself!"

13．And this is the story the small lips told

To dear Pearl Honeydew, six years old,

When she laid her head on the strawberry bed

To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.



EXERCISES.—What did little Pearl ask of the strawberries? What did they reply? Can you tell what name is given to this kind of story?

作者约翰·汤逊·特罗布里奇。1827年生于纽约奥格登，著名作家，曾以诗歌和散文的形式为儿童写过很多作品。

1．小珍珠蜜瓜，六岁大，

金色的卷发从她漂亮的耳朵边分开；

将她的头放在草莓藤上，

听听红脸蛋的莓子在说什么。

2．他们的脸颊红扑扑，他们的气息甜丝丝，

她几乎能听到他们小小心脏跳动的声音；

最微小的、含糊不清的低语声

你曾听到过的，来自土地下面。

3．“小朋友们，”她说道，“我希望知道

你们在阳光和雨露下如何茁壮成长！”

这就是莓子们讲给

六岁的小珍珠蜜瓜的故事。

4．“你希望能知道？我们也想。”

但我们不能告诉你，

除非是照料你的仁慈力量

也能够照顾可怜的小莓子们。

5．紧紧地蜷起来，

依偎在风雪织成的被子下面，

整个冬天，我们从里面看着听着，

等待第一个春日的到来，聆听蓝色知更鸟的歌唱。

6．当燕子飞回位于棕色小屋的家时，

知更鸟在头顶的树枝上筑巢，

从上好的松软土壤中，从黑暗、寒冷处，

草莓的花朵、枝蔓和叶子竞相出现。

7．“好孩子，如果他们来到跟前，

待那么一会儿，就能够听到

美妙的脚步声——

我们在夏季的高温里长得飞快。”

8．“我们的钟表是花；他们计算着小时

直到我们在阳光和雨露下变得成熟，

再加上和煦的西风和温暖的南风，

成熟的红草莓带来的时机成熟的红月份。”

9．苹果花变白，桃花谢了，

玫瑰花在花园墙边怒放，

在雏菊的花面给出时间标志之前，

我们要邀请小珍珠来赴晚宴。

10．日最长，是六月，

一年接近黄金时间段，

天气晴好，我们的盛宴

装饰着绿色的桌布和红红的草莓。

11．“就将我们夹在拇指和食指之间，

迅速地，噢，迅速！

你看，四个人中汤姆，马丁，

玛格丽特都在尽可能快地摘草莓。”

12．“噢，天哪！要是你知道

像我们这么好的草莓会被放在盒子里出售，

被陌生人享用，用金钱来换取，

你肯定会表示同情，自己吃了自己！”

13．这是小嘴唇们讲给

可爱的小珍珠蜜瓜的故事，

她把头紧贴在草莓藤上时，

想听听红脸蛋的草莓在说些什么。

LESSON 25

HARRY'S RICHES

哈里的财富


1．One day, our little Harry spent the morning with his young playmate, Johnny Crane, who lived in a fine house, and on Sundays rode to church in the grandest carriage to be seen in all the country round.

2．When Harry returned home, he said, "Mother, Johnny has money in both pockets!"

3．"Has he, dear?"

4．"Yes, ma'am; and he says he could get ever so much more if he wanted it."

5．"Well, now, that's very pleasant for him," I returned, cheerfully, as a reply was plainly expected. "Very pleasant; don't you think so?"

6．"Yes, ma'am; only—"

7．"Only what, Harry?"

8．"Why, he has a big popgun, and a watch, and a hobbyhorse, and lots of things." And Harry looked up at my face with a disconsolate(1) stare.

9．"Well, my boy, what of that?"

10．"Nothing, mother," and the telltale tears sprang to his eyes, "only I guess we are very poor, aren't we?"

11．"No, indeed, Harry, we are very far from being poor. We are not so rich as Mr. Crane's family, if that is what you mean."

12．"O mother!" insisted the little fellow, "I do think we are very poor; anyhow, I am!"

13．"O Harry!" I exclaimed, reproachfully(2).

14．"Yes, ma'am I am," he sobbed; "I have scarcely anything—I mean anything that's worth money—except things to eat and wear, and I'd have to have them anyway."

15．"Have to have them?" I echoed, at the same time laying my sewing upon the table, so that I might reason with him on that point; "do you not know, my son—"

16．Just then Uncle Ben looked up from the paper he had been reading: "Harry," said he, "I want to find out something about eyes; so, if you will let me have yours, I will give you a dollar apiece for them."

17．"For my eyes!" exclaimed Harry, very much astonished.

18．"Yes," resumed Uncle Ben, quietly, "for your eyes. I will give you chloroform(3), so it will not hurt you in the least, and you shall have a beautiful glass pair for nothing, to wear in their place. Come, a dollar apiece, cash down! What do you say? I will take them out as quick as a wink."

19．"Give you my eyes, uncle!" cried Harry, looking wild at the very thought, "I think not." And the startled(4) little fellow shook his head defiantly(5).

20．"Well, five, ten, twenty dollars, then." Harry shook his head at every offer.

21．"No, sir! I wouldn't let you have them for a thousand dollars! What could I do without my eyes? I couldn't see mother, nor the baby, nor the flowers, nor the horses, nor anything," added Harry, growing warmer and warmer.

22．"I will give you two thousand," urged Uncle Ben, taking a roll of bank notes out of his pocket. Harry, standing at a respectful distance, shouted that he never would do any such thing.

23．"Very well," continued the uncle, with a serious air, at the same time writing something in his notebook, "I can't afford(6) to give you more than two thousand dollars, so I shall have to do without your eyes; but," he added, "I will tell you what I will do, I will give you twenty dollars if you will let me put a few drops from this bottle in your ears. It will not hurt, but it will make you deaf. I want to try some experiments(7) with deafness, you see. Come quickly, now! Here are the twenty dollars all ready for you."

24．"Make me deaf!" shouted Harry, without even looking at the gold pieces temptingly displayed upon the table. "I guess you will not do that, either. Why, I couldn't hear a single word if I were deaf, could I?"

25．"Probably not," replied Uncle Ben. So, of course, Harry refused again. He would never give up his hearing, he said, "no, not for three thousand dollars."

26．Uncle Ben made another note in his book, and then came out with large bids for "a right arm," then "left arm," "hands," "feet," "nose," finally ending with an offer of ten thousand dollars for "mother," and five thousand for "the baby."

27．To all of these offers Harry shook his head, his eyes flashing, and exclamations(8) of surprise and indignation bursting from his lips. At last, Uncle Ben said he must give up his experiments, for Harry's prices were entirely too high.

28．"Ha! ha!" laughed the boy, exultingly(9), and he folded his dimpled arms and looked as if to say, "I'd like to see the man who could pay them!"

29．"Why, Harry, look here!" exclaimed Uncle Ben, peeping into his notebook, "here is a big addition sum, I tell you!" He added the numbers, and they amounted to thirty-two thousand dollars.

30．"There, Harry," said Uncle Ben, "don't you think you are foolish not to accept some of my offers?" "No, sir, I don't," answered Harry, resolutely. "Then," said Uncle Ben, "you talk of being poor, and by your own showing you have treasures(10) for which you will not take thirty-two thousand dollars. What do you say to that?"

31．Harry didn't know exactly what to say. So he blushed for a second, and just then tears came rolling down his cheeks, and he threw his chubby arms around my neck. "Mother," he whispered, "isn't God good to make everybody so rich?"

1．一天，我们的小哈里和他的小伙伴约翰尼·克莱恩玩了一上午。约翰尼住在一栋很高档的房子里，每个礼拜天都坐着全村最气派的马车去教堂。

2．当哈利回到家，他问道：“妈妈，约翰尼的两个口袋里都装着钱！”

3．“是么，亲爱的？”

4．“是的。而且他说如果他想要，还能得到更多更多的钱。”

5．“哦，那么，这对他来说非常好，”我愉快地回答道，因为显然有人期待有一个回应。“非常好，你不这样认为么？”

6．“是啊，只是——”

7．“只是什么，哈里？”

8．“为什么，他有好大的玩具枪，手表，木马，还有很多其他的东西。”哈里抬头凝视着我的脸，眼神中充满了惆怅。

9．“我的宝贝，那又怎么样？”

10．“没什么，妈妈，”他的眼里含着无法掩饰的泪水，“只是我猜咱们家很穷，是不是？”

11．“不，事实上，哈里，我们离贫穷还远着呢。不过我们不像克莱恩家那么富有，如果这是你想表达的意思的话。”

12．“噢，妈妈！”小家伙坚持说，“我确实认为我们很穷，不管怎么说，我真的这么认为！”

13．“噢，哈里！”我用责备的口吻大声说道。

14．“是的，妈妈，我真的这么认为的，”他抽泣着说，“我几乎什么都没有——我是说任何值钱的东西——除了吃的和穿的，我一定要有那些东西。”

15．“一定要有？”我重复道，与此同时将手里正在缝补的东西放在桌上，这样我就可以继续和他理论了。“儿子，难道你不知道——”

16．正在这时，本叔叔从他阅读着的报纸上看过来，“哈里，”他说道，“我正想对眼睛进行一些研究，如果你愿意把你的眼睛给我，我付给你一只眼睛一美元。”

17．“交换我的眼睛吗！”哈里异常震惊地叫道。

18．“是的，”本叔叔平静地继续说道，“换你的眼睛。我会给你打麻醉针，所以不会对你有一丁点伤害。然后你会戴上一对漂亮的玻璃眼珠，戴在眼睛的位置。来吧，一只一美元，直接付现金！你看怎么样？我会在眨眼间把它们取下来。”

19．“叔叔，把我的眼睛给你？”哈里哭喊道，看似对这个想法感到非常气愤。“我看不行。”受到惊吓的小家伙反抗地摇着头。

20．“好吧，那么5元、10元、20元呢。”哈里对每个报价都摇头。

21．“不，先生！您就是给我1000美元，我也不会给您我的眼睛！要是没了眼睛，我还能做些什么呢？我再也看不见妈妈，看不见宝宝，看不见花朵，看不见马儿，什么都看不见了。”哈里越来越焦急地补充道。

22．“我给你2000美元，”本叔叔极力劝说道，同时还从衣袋里拿出一叠纸币。哈里表示尊敬地站在保持一定距离的地方，大声喊道他绝对不会这么做的。

23．“很好，”叔叔继续说道，这次更加严肃，同时在他的笔记本上写着些什么。“因为我没法付给你超过2000美元，所以我不用你的眼睛做试验了，但——”他补充道，“我会告诉你我要怎么做。如果你让我往你耳朵滴几滴瓶子里的药水，我就给你20美元。这不疼，但会让你耳聋。我准备进行一些关于耳聋的试验。快点过来！这里是给你准备的20美元。”

24．“让我耳聋！”哈里叫道，看都没看摆在桌上的诱人金币。“我猜你也不会这么做的。如果我耳朵聋了，我就一个字都听不到了，是不是？”

25．“大概不会，”本叔叔回答。因此，哈里再次拒绝了。他不会放弃自己的听力，他说：“不行，3000美元也不行。”

26．本叔叔又在他的本子上记下了什么，然后为“一条右胳膊”、“左胳膊”、“双脚”、“鼻子”开出了更高的价钱。最后出价10000美元换“妈妈”，5000美元换“宝宝”。

27．对于这些报价，哈里都摇头，眼睛闪闪的，嘴里发出表示惊讶和愤怒的感叹。最后，本叔叔说他不得不放弃试验了，因为哈里的出价全都太高了。

28．“哈哈！”小男孩得意地笑了起来，长着酒窝的胳膊交叉抱在一起，好像在说“我很想看看谁能付得起！”

29．“哈里，看这里！”本叔叔瞟了一眼他的笔记本，叫道：“合计的总数很大，我告诉你！”他将数字加在一起，总计32000美元。

30．“那么，哈里，”本叔叔说，“你难道不认为不接受我的某些出价是很愚蠢的吗？”“不，先生，我不这么认为。”哈里果断地回答。“那么，”本叔叔说，“你说到自己很穷，通过你的表现，你全身都是宝藏，但是你又不接受32000美元的出价。你对此想说些什么？”

31．哈里不知道该说什么好，所以脸一下子红了，眼泪也从脸颊滑落下来。他用胖乎乎的胳膊搂住我的脖子。“妈妈，”他悄悄地说，“上帝让每个人都如此富有，难道不是很好么？”

LESSON 26

IN TIME'S SWING

在时间的秋千上


1．Father Time, your footsteps go

Lightly as the falling snow.

In your swing I'm sitting, see!

Push me softly; one, two, three,

Twelve times only. Like a sheet,

Spread the snow beneath my feet.

Singing merrily, let me swing

Out of winter into spring.

2．Swing me out, and swing me in!

Trees are bare, but birds begin

Twittering(1) to the peeping leaves,

On the bough beneath the eaves.

Wait,—one lilac bud I saw.

Icy hillsides feel the thaw.

April chased off March to-day;

Now I catch a glimpse(2) of May.

3．Oh, the smell of sprouting grass!

In a blur(3) the violets pass.

Whispering from the wildwood come

Mayflower's breath and insect's hum.

Roses carpeting the ground;

Thrushes, orioles, warbling sound:—

Swing me low, and swing me high,

To the warm clouds of July.

4．Slower now, for at my side

White pond lilies open wide.

Underneath the pine's tall spire

Cardinal blossoms burn like fire.

They are gone; the golden-rod

Flashes from the dark green sod.

Crickets in the grass I hear;

Asters light the fading year.

5．Slower still! October weaves

Rainbows of the forest leaves.

Gentians fringed, like eyes of blue,

Glimmer out of sleety dew.

Meadow green I sadly miss:

Winds through withered sedges hiss.

Oh, 't is snowing, swing me fast,

While December shivers past!

6．Frosty-bearded Father Time,

Stop your footfall on the rime(4)!

Hard you push, your hand is rough;

You have swung me long enough.

"Nay, no stopping," say you? Well,

Some of your best stories tell,

While you swing me—gently, do!—

From the Old Year to the New.



(Lucy Larcom)

1．时间老人，

你的足迹像雪落般轻盈。

我正坐在你的秋千上，看！

温柔地推我；一、二、三；

只有十二次。像一片被单，

将雪片铺展在我脚下。

欢快地歌唱，让我摇摆

走出冬季，走进春季。

2．将我摇进又摇出！

树木光秃秃的，

但鸟儿已开始在屋檐下的树枝上，

对着隐约出现的树叶叽叽喳喳叫不停。

等等——我看到了一个丁香花蕾。

积雪的山坡有了融化的迹象。

今天，四月赶走了三月；

现在我已经瞥见了五月的影子。

3．噢，青草发芽的味道！

朦胧中眼睛扫过紫罗兰

五月花的气息和昆虫的哼鸣

在原始森林中悄悄传递，

玫瑰花铺满了整个大地；

画眉、黄鹂，婉转的叫声——

把我摇高又摇低，

摇进七月温暖的云朵里。

4．现在慢点摇，因为在我身边

白色的睡莲已经怒放。

在松树高大的树冠下，

绯红的花朵如火焰般燃烧。

等花儿离去，

鼠尾草从深绿色的草皮中星星点点冒出。

我听到草地中蟋蟀的声音，

紫菀花点亮了黯淡的一年。

5．还要再摇慢一些！十月编织出

森林里树叶的彩虹，

龙胆花的点缀，像蓝色的眼睛，

在雨夹雪的露水中若隐若现。

我悲伤地思念着草地的绿色：

风儿穿过枯萎的沙草，嘶嘶作响。

哦，要下雪了，把我摇快些，

当十二月在战栗中度过！

6．白胡子的时间老人，

停下你在白霜上的脚步！

你推得太用力，你的手是那么粗糙；

你已经为我摇了足够长的时间。

你说“不，别停下，”好吧，

当你给我摇秋千时，

讲讲你最好的故事吧——轻轻地，讲吧！——

从过去的一年讲到新的一年。



（露西·拉科姆）

LESSON 27

HARRY AND HIS DOG

哈利与他的狗


1．"Beg, Frisk, beg," said little Harry, as he sat on an inverted(1) basket, at his grandmother's door, eating, with great satisfaction, a porringer(2) of bread and milk. His little sister Annie, who had already dispatched her breakfast, sat on the ground opposite to him, now twisting her flowers into garlands, and now throwing them away.

2．"Beg, Frisk, beg!" repeated Harry, holding a bit of bread just out of the dog's reach; and the obedient Frisk squatted himself on his hind legs, and held up his fore paws, waiting for master Harry to give him the tempting morsel.

3．The little boy and the little dog were great friends. Frisk loved him dearly, much better than he did anyone else; perhaps, because he recollected(3) that Harry was his earliest and firmest friend during a time of great trouble.

4．Poor Frisk had come as a stray dog to Milton, the place where Harry lived. If he could have told his own story, it would probably have been a very pitiful one, of kicks and cuffs, of hunger and foul weather.

5．Certain it is, he made his appearance at the very door where Harry was now sitting, in miserable plight(4), wet, dirty, and half starved; and that there he met Harry, who took a fancy to him, and Harry's grandmother, who drove him off with a broom.

6．Harry, at length, obtained permission for the little dog to remain as a sort of outdoor pensioner(5), and fed him with stray bones and cold potatoes, and such things as he could get for him. He also provided him with a little basket to sleep in, the very same which, turned up, afterward served Harry for a seat.

7．After a while, having proved his good qualities by barking away a set of pilferers(6), who were making an attack on the great pear tree, he was admitted into the house, and became one of its most vigilant(7) and valued inmates(8). He could fetch or carry either by land or water; would pick up a thimble or a ball of cotton, if little Annie should happen to drop them; or take Harry's dinner to school for him with perfect honesty.

8．"Beg, Frisk, beg!" said Harry, and gave him, after long waiting, the expected morsel. Frisk was satisfied, but Harry was not. The little boy, though a good-humored fellow in the main, had turns of naughtiness, which were apt to last him all day, and this promised to prove one of his worst. It was a holiday(9), and in the afternoon his cousins, Jane and William, were to come and see him and Annie; and the pears were to be gathered, and the children were to have a treat.



9．Harry, in his impatience, thought the morning would never be over. He played such pranks—buffeting(10) Frisk, cutting the curls off of Annie's doll, and finally breaking his grandmother's spectacles—that before his visitors arrived, indeed, almost immediately after dinner, he contrived to be sent to bed in disgrace.

10．Poor Harry! there he lay, rolling and kicking, while Jane, and William, and Annie were busy about the fine, mellow Windsor pears. William was up in the tree, gathering and shaking; Annie and Jane catching them in their aprons, and picking them up from the ground; now piling them in baskets, and now eating the nicest and ripest; while Frisk was barking gayly among them, as if he were catching Windsor pears, too!

11．Poor Harry! He could hear all this glee and merriment through the open window, as he lay in bed. The storm of passion having subsided(11), there he lay weeping and disconsolate, a grievous sob bursting forth every now and then, as he heard the loud peals of childish laughter, and as he thought how he should have laughed, and how happy he should have been, had he not forfeited(12) all this pleasure by his own bad conduct.

12．He wondered if Annie would not be so good-natured as to bring him a pear. All on a sudden, he heard a little foot on the stair, pitapat, and he thought she was coming. Pitapat came the foot, nearer and nearer, and at last a small head peeped, half afraid, through the half-open door.

13．But it was not Annie's head; it was Frisk's—poor Frisk, whom Harry had been teasing and tormenting all the morning, and who came into the room wagging his tail, with a great pear in his mouth; and, jumping upon the bed, He laid it in the little boy's hand.

14．Is not Frisk a fine, grateful fellow? and does he not deserve a share of Harry's breakfast, whether he begs for it or not? And little Harry will remember from the events of this day that kindness, even though shown to a dog, will always be rewarded; and that ill nature and bad temper are connected(13) with nothing but pain and disgrace.

1．“作揖，弗里斯克，作揖！”小哈利说道，他坐在祖母家门口一个倒扣的篮子上，心满意足地吃着面包和牛奶。他的妹妹安妮已经很快地解决了她的早餐，坐在哈利对面的地方将花朵扭成花环，又把它们扔到了一边。

2．“作揖，弗里斯克，作揖！”哈利重复道，在小狗吃不到的地方举着一点面包。温顺的狗狗弗里斯克用后腿支撑着蹲在地上，抬起它的前爪，等待主人哈里给它诱人的美味佳肴。

3．小男孩和小狗是亲密的朋友。弗里斯克非常爱它的小主人，对他比对其他任何人都好。也许因为它记得哈利是它遇到大麻烦时最早认识和最坚定的朋友。

4．可怜的弗里斯克在来到哈里居住的密尔顿之前是一条流浪狗。如果它能够讲述自己的故事，那很可能是一段辛酸的经历，被人又踢又打，忍饥挨饿，天气恶劣。

5．可以确定的是，它出现在哈利家门口时——就是哈利现在坐着的地方——是一副惨兮兮的样子：身上湿漉漉、脏兮兮的，已经饿得半死了。在这里它遇到了哈利，哈利喜欢上了它，而哈利的奶奶则想用扫帚把它赶走。

6．最后，哈利获得了允许，可以将小狗留在室外喂养。他给它喂一些零散的骨头，凉土豆和其他类似他能弄到的东西。他还给它准备了一个小篮子用来睡觉，就是后来被哈利倒扣过来当座椅的那个。

7．又过了一段时间，小狗用叫声吓走了一群要偷袭大梨树的小偷，它的优良品质得以很好地展现。之后，家里允许它进屋了，它成了家里最机警、最宝贵的一员。它可以在陆路或水路取东西、运东西；如果安妮不小心将顶针或棉球掉在地上，它会帮她捡起来；抑或是绝对诚信地到学校给哈利送午餐。

8．“作揖，弗里斯克，作揖！”哈利说。在长时间的等待之后，把期待的美味扔给了它。弗里斯克非常满足，但哈利不是。虽然总的来说哈里是个幽默的小男孩，但有时也会有调皮的一面，而且很可能会持续一整天。这是他最差劲的一面。那是一个假日，他的堂姐简和堂兄威廉下午会到这里看他和安妮，正值采摘梨子的时节，孩子们可以大大享用一番。

9．哈利不耐烦了，觉得上午过得太慢。他搞了一些恶作剧：打弗里斯克，剪掉安妮的洋娃娃的卷发，最后打碎了奶奶的眼镜——这一切全都发生在客人到达之前。事实上，几乎是刚吃过饭，他就灰溜溜地被要求待在床上了。

10．可怜的哈利！他躺在床上，又踢又滚；简、威廉和安妮忙着采摘上好的成熟温莎梨。威廉爬到树上，边摘边摇，安妮和简忙着用围裙接住梨子，还不时地捡起掉在地上的。然后把梨都装到筐里，挑出最好的、熟透的来吃。弗里斯克在他们中间欢快地叫着，好像它也要去摘梨子似的！

11．可怜的哈利！他躺在床上，透过打开的窗户听见了外面所有的欢声笑语。热情的浪潮渐渐褪去，他愁眉苦脸地躺在那儿，不停地哭泣。当听到孩子们响亮的笑声时，想到要不是因为他的恶劣表现，他此刻该如何欢笑时，他偶尔还会悲伤地抽泣一下。

12．他在想安妮是不是不会好心地给他送梨了。忽然间，他听到了楼梯上很轻的脚步声，砰砰，他认为是安妮来了。砰砰，脚步声越来越近了。最后，一个小脑袋怯怯地从半开着的门缝挤了进来。

13．但那不是安妮的头；是弗里斯克——可怜的弗里斯克。哈利逗弄、折磨了它整个早上。它摇着尾巴进了屋，嘴里叼着一个巨大的梨子；然后跳上床，把梨放在小男孩的手里。

14．弗里斯克是不是一个有良心的好伙伴？不管它作揖没作揖，难道它不应该得到哈利给的一份早餐吗？从这天发生的一系列事件中，小哈利将会记住友好的善行总会得到回报，即使对象是一条小狗；另外，恶毒和坏脾气只会与痛苦、耻辱联系在一起。

LESSON 28

THE VOICE OF THE GRASS

小草之声


1．Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;

By the dusty roadside,

On the sunny hillside,

Close by the noisy brook,

In every shady nook,

I come creeping, creeping, everywhere.

2．Here I come, creeping, creeping everywhere;

All round the open door,

Where sit the aged poor,

Here where the children play,

In the bright and merry May,

I come creeping, creeping, everywhere.

3．Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;

You can not see me coming,

Nor hear my low, sweet humming,

For in the starry night,

And the glad morning light,

I come, quietly creeping, everywhere.

4．Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;

More welcome than the flowers,

In summer's pleasant hours;

The gentle cow is glad,

And the merry birds not sad,

To see me creeping, creeping, everywhere.

5．Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;

When you're numbered with the dead,

In your still and narrow bed,

In the happy spring I'll come,

And deck your narrow home,

Creeping, silently creeping, everywhere.

6．Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;

My humble song of praise,

Most gratefully I raise,

To Him at whose command

I beautify the land,

Creeping, silently creeping, everywhere.



(Sarah Roberts)

1．我来啦，到处爬呀，爬呀，

沿着尘土飞扬的路边，

爬上阳光灿烂的山坡，

接近潺潺的小溪，

在每一处荫凉的角落。

我来啦，到处爬呀，爬呀。

2．我来啦，到处爬呀，爬呀，

围着敞开的房门，

这里坐着上了年纪的人，

在明媚的五月，

孩子们来此玩耍。

我来啦，到处爬呀，爬呀。

你们看不到我来了，

也听不到我甜美的低声哼唱，

因为在有星星的夜晚，

和欢快的晨光里，

我来啦，到处爬呀，爬呀。

在夏季的美好时光里，

比花朵更受欢迎；

温顺的牛儿很欢乐，

快乐鸟儿不悲伤，

看着我到处爬呀，爬呀。

当死亡降临，

你躺在静静的坟墓里，

我会在快乐的春天到来，

装点你的坟墓，

爬呀，沉默地爬呀，到处爬。

6．我来啦，到处爬呀，爬呀，

充满感激的唱起，

向着引导我

美化了大地的他，

LESSON 29

THE EAGLE

鹰


1．The eagle seems to enjoy a kind of supremacy(1) over the rest of the inhabitants of the air. Such is the loftiness of his flight, that he often soars(2) in the sky beyond the reach of the naked eye, and such is his strength that he has been known to carry away children in his talons. But many of the noble qualities imputed(3) to him are rather fanciful than true.

2．He has been described as showing a lofty(4) independence, which makes him disdain(5) to feed on anything that is not slain by his own strength. But Alexander Wilson, the great naturalist, says that he has seen an eagle feasting on the carcass(6) of a horse. The eagle lives to a great age. One at Vienna is stated to have died after a confinement of one hundred and four years.

3．There are several species(7) of the eagle. The golden eagle, which is one of the largest, is nearly four feet from the point of the beak to the end of the tail. He is found in most parts of Europe, and is also met with in America. High rocks and ruined and lonely towers are the places which he chooses for his abode. His nest is composed of sticks and rushes. The tail feathers are highly valued as ornaments by the American Indians.

4．The most interesting(8) species is the bald eagle, as this is an American bird, and the adopted(9) emblem(10) of our country. He lives chiefly upon fish, and is found in the neighborhood of the sea, and along the shores and cliffs of our large lakes and rivers.

5．According to the description given by Wilson, he depends, in procuring his food, chiefly upon the labors of others. He watches the fishhawk as he dives into the sea for his prey, and darting down upon him as he rises, forces him to relinquish(11) his victim, and then seizes it before it again reaches the water.

6．One of the most notable(12) species is the harpy eagle. This is said to be bold and strong, and to attack beasts, and even man himself. He is fierce, quarrelsome, and sullen(13), living alone in the deepest forests. He is found chiefly in South America.

1．鹰似乎比飞在空中的其他动物拥有更至高无上的地位。包括它的飞行高度——它能够在空中翱翔到肉眼看不到的高度，还有它的力量——据说它可以用爪子提起小孩。但是它被赋予的很多卓越品质都是想象出来的，并不是事实。

2．在人们的描述中，它表现出很高傲的自主性。这使它不屑于进食非它自己力量杀死的猎物。但伟大的博物学家亚历山大·威尔森说他曾看到一只鹰把一匹马的残骸当大餐。鹰可以活到很大年纪。一只生活在维也纳的鹰据说在被饲养了104年后离世。

3．鹰分为很多种类。金鹰，即鹫，是最大的之一，从鸟喙的顶点到尾部几乎有四英尺长。它生活在欧洲大部分地区，同样也出现在美国。高高的岩石或者废弃、荒凉的高塔是它自己选择的栖身之所。它的窝一般由木棍和灯芯草制成。鹫尾部的羽毛非常名贵，因为美洲的印第安人用它们做装饰品。

4．最有趣的种类要数秃鹰了，因为它是一种美国鸟，并且已经被当作了美国的象征。它主要以鱼类为食，栖息在美国附近的海域，以及大河、大湖的海岸边和岩石上。

5．根据威尔森给出的描述，秃鹰获取食物主要依靠其他鸟类的劳动。当鱼鹰扎进海里捕食猎物时，秃鹰会在一边旁观。等鱼鹰一出水面，秃鹰就会冲撞它，迫使它放弃猎物，然后在猎物返回水面前把它抓住。

6．其中最引人注目的是哈比鹰。据说它非常大胆，非常强壮，会袭击野兽甚至人类。同时它也异常凶猛、好斗，总是非常阴郁而沉默，独自生活在森林深处。主要栖息在南美地区。

LESSON 30

THE OLD EAGLE TREE

老鹰树


1．In a distant field, stood a large tulip tree, apparently of a century's(1) growth, and one of the most gigantic(2). It looked like the father of the surrounding forest. A single tree of huge dimensions(3), standing all alone, is a sublime(4) object.

2．On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly called the "Fishing Eagle," had built her nest every year, for many years, and, undisturbed, had raised her young. A remarkable place to choose, as she procured her food from the ocean, and this tree stood full ten miles from the seashore. It had long been known as the "Old Eagle Tree."

3．On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were hoeing corn in an adjoining field. At a certain hour of the day, the old eagle was known to set off for the seaside, to gather food for her young. As she this day returned with a large fish in her claws, the workmen surrounded the tree, and, by yelling and hooting, and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird that she dropped her fish, and they carried it off in triumph.

4．The men soon dispersed(5), but Joseph sat down under a bush near by, to watch, and to bestow unavailing(6) pity. The bird soon returned to her nest, without food. The eaglets(7) at once set up a cry for food, so shrill, so clear, and so clamorous(8) that the boy was greatly moved.

5．The parent bird seemed to try to soothe them; but their appetites were too keen, and it was all in vain. She then perched herself on a limb near them, and looked down into the nest in a manner that seemed to say, "I know not what to do next."

6．Her indecision(9) was but momentary(10); again she poised herself, uttered one or two sharp notes, as if telling them to "lie still," balanced her body, spread her wings, and was away again for the sea.

7．Joseph was determined to see the result. His eye followed her till she grew small, smaller, a mere speck in the sky, and then disappeared. What boy has not thus watched the flight of the bird of his country!

8．She was gone nearly two hours, about double her usual time for a voyage, when she again returned, on a slow, weary wing, flying uncommonly low, in order to have a heavier atmosphere to sustain her, with another fish in her talons.

9．On nearing the field, she made a circuit(11) round it, to see if her enemies were again there. Finding the coast clear, she once more reached the tree, drooping, faint, and weary, and evidently nearly exhausted(12)．Again the eaglets set up their cry, which was soon hushed by the distribution of a dinner, such as, save the cooking, a king might admire.

10．"Glorious bird!" cried the boy, "what a spirit!" Other birds can fly more swiftly, others can sing more sweetly, others scream more loudly; but what other bird, when persecuted and robbed, when weary, when discouraged, when so far from the sea, would do this?

11．"Glorious bird! I will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I will never forget, hereafter, that when the spirit is determined it can do almost anything. Others would have drooped, and hung the head, and mourned over the cruelty of man, and sighed over the wants of the nestlings(13); but thou, by at once recovering the loss, hast forgotten all."

12．"I will learn of thee, noble bird! I will remember this. I will set my mark high. I will try to do something, and to be something in the world; I will never yield to discouragements."



EXERCISES.—Relate the story of the "Old Eagle Tree." What lesson was taught the boy who watched the eagle's actions?





【中文阅读】


1．在很远的地方矗立着一棵高大的郁金香树，显然已经生长了一个世纪，是那里最大的树木之一。它看起来像是附近森林的父辈。一棵体积如此庞大的树木孤零零站立在那里，是一个非常壮观的景象。

2．在这棵树的顶端，一只老鹰——通常称作“鱼鹰”——每年都在此筑她的鸟巢，养育它的下一代，并且已经持续了很多年，没有受到任何干扰。由于它要到大海里觅食，所以要挑选一个比较醒目的地方搭窝，而这棵树距离海边整整10英里。长久以来，人们将这棵树叫做“老鹰树”。

3．在一个阳光灿烂的日子里，空气都是暖暖的。干活的人们在附近的玉米地里锄草。在一天的某个特定时刻，人们知道老鹰会出发去海边，为它的孩子们觅食。这天回来时，它爪子里抓着一条大鱼。干农活的人们围到了树边，不断地又喊又叫，还向上扔石头，以此来吓唬可怜的鸟儿，使得它的鱼掉了下去。他们沾沾自喜地把鱼拿走了。

4．人们很快散去，但约瑟夫在附近一个安静的地方坐了下来，想看看会怎么样，并且表达一下徒劳的同情。鸟儿很快回到了它的巢，什么食物也没带回来。小鹰们立刻开始哭叫着要食物，声音是那么的尖利，那么的清晰，那么的吵闹，以至于男孩都被深深地触动了。

5．大鹰似乎在设法安抚它们，但它们的食欲太过旺盛，一切的安慰都无济于事。随后，大鹰飞到了它们附近的一个树枝上栖息，低头向鸟巢里看去，那姿态仿佛在说“我不知道下面该怎么办”。

6．它的不知所措只持续了很短的时间；随即，它做好了准备，发出了一两声高亢的叫声，好似在告诉小鹰们“静静躺着”，身体找好了平衡，展了展翅膀，再次朝大海飞去。

7．约瑟夫决定要看看结果。他的眼光跟随着大鹰，直到它的身影越来越小，变成了天空中的一个小点，最后彻底消失了。哪个男孩没看过自己国家国鸟的翱翔呢！

8．大鹰离开了大概两个小时，这几乎是它平时出海觅食时间的两倍。当它再次回来的时候，翅膀挥动得很慢很疲惫，飞得极不寻常的低，为的是让更厚重的大气支撑着它，它的爪子里抓着另一条鱼。

9．快接近大树所在地时，它围着那里盘旋了一圈，看看敌人是不是还在。当发现附近很清静时，它再次落在了树上，低垂着头，又虚弱又疲倦，显然已经快精疲力尽了。小鹰们又叫开了，不过分配晚餐很快让它们安静了下来。

10．“光荣的鸟！”男孩叫道，“这是何等的精神啊！”其他的鸟能够飞得更快，唱得更甜美，叫得更大声，但是，其他的鸟，在受到非难和抢劫，在疲惫不堪，灰心丧气，离海这么远的地方，能够像它这么做吗？

11．“光荣的鸟！今天我从你这里学到了一课。从今以后，我永远不会忘记，只要有了一种精神，就能够做成任何事。其他人可能会垂头丧气，哀伤人们的残忍行为，为雏鸟的需求而叹息，但是你，迅速弥补了损失，忘记了一切。”

12．“我要向你学习，高贵的鸟儿！我会记住这件事，把自己的目标定得高些。我要设法做出些成绩，在世界上成为非同寻常的人物；我永远不会向挫折屈服。”

ALPINE SONG

阿尔卑斯之歌


William W. Story, the author, was born in Salem, Mass., In 1819. His writings in poetry and prose are well known, and he also gained distinction in his profession as a sculptor. He died in 1895.

1．With alpenstock(1) and knapsack(2) light,

I wander o'er hill and valley;

I climb the snow peak's flashing height,

And sleep in the sheltered chalet(3),—

Free in heart—happy and free—

This is the summer life for me.

2．The city's dust I leave behind

For the keen, sweet air of the mountain,

The grassy path by the wild rose lined,

The gush(4) of the living fountain,—

Free in heart—happy and free—

This is the summer life for me.

3．High above me snow clouds rise,

In the early morning gleaming;

And the patterned(5) valley beneath me lies

Softly in sunshine dreaming,—

Free in heart—happy and free—

This is the summer life for me.

4．The bells of wandering herds I list(6),

Chiming in upland meadows;

How sweet they sound, as I lie at rest

Under the dark pine shadows, —

Glad in heart—happy and free—

This is the summer life for me.

1．手拿登山杖，身背轻轻的行囊，

我在丘陵和山谷中穿行；

我爬上雪峰耀眼的高度，

睡在避风的小木屋——

心灵无比自由——快乐和自由——

这是我在夏季的生活。

2．城市的尘土被我抛在了身后

迎来山里凛冽而清新的空气，

成排的野玫瑰间是布满情操的小径，

喷涌出的活泉——

心灵无比自由——快乐和自由——

这是我的夏季生活。

3．清晨隐约的微光中，

在我头顶的天空里，雪白的云朵升起来，

阳光的梦境中，

我脚下图案般的山谷显得愈加柔和——

心灵无比自由——快乐和自由——

这是我的夏季生活。

4．我听到游荡的牧群发出的钟声，

在高地牧场响起;

当我放松地躺在黑松的树荫下,

它们听起来多么甜美——

心灵无比愉悦——快乐和自由——

这是我的夏季生活。

LESSON 32

CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES

环境不同，处理各异


1．Derby. Good morning, neighbor Scrapewell. I have half a dozen miles to ride to-day, and shall be extremely(1) obliged if you will lend me your gray mare.

2．Scrapewell. It would give me great pleasure to oblige you, friend Derby; but I am under the necessity of going to the mill this very morning, with a bag of corn. My wife wants the meal to-day, and you know what a time there'll be if I disappoint her.

3．D. Then she must want it still, for I can assure you the mill does not go to-day. I heard the miller tell Will Davis that the water was too low.

4．S. You don't say so! That is bad, indeed; for in that case I shall be obliged to gallop off to town for the meal. My wife would comb my head for me if I should neglect it.

5．D. I can save you this journey, for I have plenty of meal at home, and will lend your wife as much as she wants.

6．S. Ah! neighbor Derby, I am sure your meal would never suit my wife. You can't conceive how whimsical(2) she is.

7．D. If she were ten times more whimsical than she is, I am certain she would like it; for you sold it to me yourself, and you assured me it was the best you ever had.

8．S. Yes, yes! that's true, indeed; I always have the best of everything. You know, neighbor Derby, that no one is more ready to oblige a friend than I am; but I must tell you the mare this morning refused to eat hay; and, truly, I am afraid she will not carry you.

9．D. Oh, never fear! I will feed her well with oats on the road.

10．S. Oats! neighbor; oats are very dear.

11．D. Never mind that. When I have a good job in view, I never stand for trifles.

12．S. But it is very slippery; and I am really afraid she will fall and break your neck.

13．D. Give yourself no uneasiness about that. The mare is certainly sure-footed; and, besides, you were just now talking of galloping her to town.

14．S. Well, then, to tell you the plain truth, though I wish to oblige you with all my heart, my saddle is torn quite in pieces, and I have just sent my bridle to be mended.

15．D. Luckily, I have both a bridle and a saddle hanging up at home.

16．S. Ah! that may be; but I am sure your saddle will never fit my mare. She's very notional.

17．D. Why, then I'll borrow neighbor Clodpole's.

18．S. Clodpole's! his will no more fit than yours.

19．D. At the worst, then, I will go to my good friend, Squire Jones. He has half a score of them; and I am sure he will lend me one that will fit her.

20．S. You know, friend Derby, that no one is more willing to oblige his neighbors than I am. I do assure you the beast should be at your service, with all my heart; but she has not been curried(3), I believe, for three weeks past. Her foretop(4) and mane want combing and cutting very much. If anyone should see her in her present plight, it would ruin the sale of her.



21．D. Oh, a horse is soon curried, and my son Sam shall attend to it at once.

22．S. Yes, very likely; but I this moment recollect the creature has no shoes on.

23．D. Well, is there not a blacksmith hard by?

24．S. What, that tinker, Dobson? I would not trust such a bungler(5) to shoe a goat. No, no; none but uncle Tom Thumper shall shoe my mare.

25．D. As good luck will have it, then, I shall pass right by his door.

26．S. [Calling to his son.] Tim, Tim! here's neighbor Derby, who wants the loan of the gray mare, to ride to town to-day. You know the skin was rubbed off her back, last week, a hand's breadth or more. [Gives Tim a wink.] However, I believe she is well enough by this time. You know, Tim, how ready I am to oblige my neighbors; indeed, we ought to do all the good we can in this world. We must certainly let neighbor Derby have her if she will possibly answer his purpose. Yes, yes; I see plainly by Tim's countenance, neighbor Derby, that he's disposed(6) to oblige you. I would not have refused you the mare for the worth of her. If I had, I should have expected you to refuse me in turn. None of my neighbors can accuse me of being backward(7) in doing them a kindness whenever it is possible. Come, Tim, what do you say?

27．Tim. What do I say, father? Why, sir, I say that I am no less ready than you are to do a neighborly kindness. But the mare is by no means capable(8) of performing(9) the journey. About a hand's breadth, did you say? Why, sir, the skin is torn from the poor creature's back the bigness of your broadbrimmed hat! And, besides, I have promised her, so soon as she is able to travel, to Ned Saunders, to carry a load of apples to market.

28．S. Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very sorry matters are thus. I would not have disobliged you for the price of two such mares. Believe me, neighbor Derby, I am really sorry, for your sake, that matters turn out thus.

29．D. And I as much for yours, neighbor Scrapewell; for to tell you the truth I received a letter this morning from Mr. Griffin, who tells me if I will be in town to-day he will give me the refusal(10) of all that lot of timber, which he is about cutting down, on the side of the hill; and I had intended you should have shared half of it, which would have been not less than fifty dollars in your pocket. But, as your—

30．S. Fifty dollars, did you say?

31．D. Ay, truly, did I; but as your mare is out of order, I'll go and see if I can get old Roan, the blacksmith's horse.

32．S. Old Roan! My mare is at your service, neighbor, Here, Tim, tell Ned Saunders he can't have the mare: neighbor Derby wants her; and I won't refuse so good a friend anything he asks for.

33．D. But what are you to do for meal?

34．S. My wife can do without it for a week if you want the mare so long.

35．D. But, then, your saddle is all in pieces.

36．S. I meant the old one. I have bought a new one since, and you shall have the first use of it.

37．D. And shall I call at Thumper's and get the mare shod?

38．S. No, no; I had forgotten to tell you that I let neighbor Dobson shoe her, last week, by way of trial; and, to do him justice, he shoes extremely well.

39．D. But, if the poor creature has lost so much skin from off her back—

40．S. Poh, poh! That is just one of Tim's large stories. I do assure you it was not, at first, bigger than my thumb nail, and I am certain it has not grown any since.

41．D. At least, however, let her have something she will eat, since she refuses hay.

42．S. She did, indeed, refuse hay this morning; but the only reason was that she was crammed(11) full of oats. You have nothing to fear, neighbor; the mare is in perfect trim; and she will skim you over the ground like a bird. I wish you a good journey and a profitable job.

1．德比（以下简称“德”）：早上好，斯科利普韦尔。我今天要赶十几英里路，如果你能把你的灰马借我，我将感激不尽。

2．斯科利普韦尔（以下简称“斯”）：能够帮你是我莫大的荣幸，德比；但我今天一早就必须要到磨坊去，还要驮着一袋玉米。我妻子今天想吃粗粮，你知道，如果我让她扫兴了，日子得多难过。

3．德：那么她一定会更想吃了，因为我可以向你保证，磨坊今天不开门。我听说磨坊主跟威廉姆·戴维斯说水位太低了。

4．斯：不见得吧！不过确实是太倒霉了；那样的话我就不得不骑马飞奔着进城去弄粗粮了。如果我忽略了这件事，我妻子肯定会修理我的。

5．德：我能让你不必出门了，因为我家里有很多粗粮，可以借给你妻子，她要多少都行。

6．斯：啊！德比，我敢肯定你的粗粮不符合我妻子的要求，你都想象不出她有多古怪。

7．德：即使她比现在古怪十倍，我也敢肯定她会喜欢我的粗粮，因为这些是你们卖给我的，你还保证说这是你们最好的。

8．斯：是的，是的！确实是事实；我的一切东西都总是最好的。你看，德比，没人比我更乐于助人了。但是我必须告诉你，今天早上灰马拒绝吃草，事实上，我是担心它载不了你。

9．德：哦，不用担心！我会在路上给它喂燕麦的。

10．斯：燕麦！邻居啊，燕麦很贵。

11．德：没关系。当有个好工作在望时，我不会在乎细微小事的。

12．斯：但是路非常湿滑，我真的很担心它摔倒后折断你的脖子。

13．德：您自己千万不要为此担忧。灰马肯定会步履稳健的，另外，刚才您还说要骑着它飞奔去镇上呢。

14．斯：那么，跟你说实话吧，虽然我全新全意想要帮助你，可我的马鞍已经破成一片一片的了，而且我也已经把缰绳送去修理了。

15．德：运气不错，我家里正挂着一副马鞍和缰绳。

16．斯：哈！那倒是可能，但我相信你的马鞍配我的灰马肯定不合适。它是很有想法的。

17．德：咳，那么我去借邻居克劳德普家的。

18．斯：克劳德普家的！他的不会比你那个更合适。

19．德：最坏的情况是，我去找好朋友斯贵艾尔·琼斯。他那有十来个，我相信他会把适合灰马的借给我。

20．斯：德比，你看，没人比我更乐于帮助邻居了。我全心全意地向你保证，这匹马应该服务于你；但在过去三个星期我都没给它梳理额毛和鬃毛，额毛和鬃毛现在非常需要修剪。如果有人看到它这么糟糕，肯定会降低它的身价的。

21．德：哦，给马梳洗很快就能完成，而且我儿子山姆马上就可以来做。

22．斯：是的，很可能；但是此时此刻我才想起，这个家伙还没有马掌呢。

23．德：那么，附近不是有个铁匠铺吗？

24．斯：什么，那个小炉匠多布森？我都不相信那么个笨手笨脚的人会给山羊钉掌。不，不，其他人都不行，只有汤姆·萨姆皮尔大叔能够给我的灰马钉掌。

25．德：好运气啊，我正巧会路过他家门口。

26．斯：［喊他儿子］蒂姆，蒂姆！我们的邻居德比来了，他今天想借灰马去镇上。你是知道的，上周灰马背上擦破了皮，有一掌多宽。[朝蒂姆眨了眨眼睛]但是，我想它现在应该好了。蒂姆，你是知道的，我是多么愿意帮助邻居。事实上，我们应该在世界上尽可能地多做善事。如果灰马能适合他的需要，我们当然会把它借给德比。是的，是的。德比，我明显地看到了蒂姆的表情，他不同意借给你。我原本不会因为一匹灰马的价值而回绝你。如果我这么做了，我反过来应该期待你来拒绝我。没有任何一位邻居指责我，说我在可能帮到他们忙时打退堂鼓。行了，蒂姆，你要说什么？

27．蒂：我说什么，爸爸？为什么，先生，我是想说我和您一样愿意为邻居提供帮助做好事。但是灰马真的无法完成这次行程。您不是说大概有一掌多宽么？先生，那个可怜的家伙背上的皮肤撕裂了宽檐帽那么大一片！再说，我也已经答应奈德·桑德斯了，一旦它能上路，就借给他运一批苹果去市场。

28．斯：听到了吗，我的邻居？我非常抱歉事情是这样。就算是两匹灰马的钱，我也不会拒绝帮助你。相信我，德比，我真的非常抱歉到你这儿事情变成了这样。

29．德：我同样对您表示非常遗憾，斯科利普韦尔。因为和您实话实说，我今早收到一封格里芬先生的信，他告诉我如果我今天去镇上一趟，他会给我所有木材的优先选择权，就是他在山坡上准备砍伐的那些树木。而且我本打算分给您一半，价值不会少于您口袋里的美元。但是，既然您——

30．斯：你是说，50美元？

31．德：唉，是啊，我是这么说的。但是既然您的灰马不在状态，我去看看能不能借铁匠家的老杂毛马。

32．斯：老杂毛！邻居，我的灰马可以随时为你服务。蒂姆，告诉奈德·桑德斯他不能用灰马了，邻居德比用了。这么要好的朋友的任何请求我都是不会拒绝的。

33．德：您要用粗粮来做什么呀？

34．斯：如果你需要借用灰马一星期，我妻子可以这段时间都不用粗粮。

35．德：但是，您的马鞍都破成片了。

36．斯：我指的是旧的那个。后来我又买了个新的，你应该是第一个用的。

37．德：那我还用去萨姆皮尔店里给灰马钉掌吗？

38．斯：不用，不用。我忘了告诉你，我上周让邻居多布森尝试着给它钉掌了。而且，公平地说，他钉掌钉得很好。

39．德：但是，如果可怜的家伙背上脱了很多皮——

40．斯：咳，咳！那只是蒂姆编的一个故事。我向你保证，最初那块比我的拇指指甲大不了多少，我肯定之后也没再长得更大。

41．德：不过，由于它不吃草，至少让它吃些能吃的东西。

42．斯：今天早上它确实不吃草；但是唯一的原因是它吃了太多燕麦。我的邻居，你什么都不用担心，灰马刷洗得很干净，它能载着你像鸟儿般在路上飞驰。祝你一路顺风，工作盈利。

LESSON 33

THE NOBLEST REVENGE

最高尚的复仇


1．"I will have revenge(1) on him, that I will, and make him heartily repent(2) it," said Philip to himself, with a countenance(3) quite red with anger. His mind was so engaged that he did not see Stephen, who happened at that instant to meet him.

2．"Who is that," said Stephen, "on whom you intend to be revenged?" Philip, as if awakened from a dream, stopped short, and looking at his friend, soon resumed(4) a smile that was natural to his countenance. "Ah," said he, "you remember my bamboo, a very pretty cane which was given me by my father, do you not? Look! there it is in pieces. It was farmer Robinson's son who reduced it to this worthless state."

3．Stephen very coolly asked him what had induced(5) young Robinson to break it. "I was walking peaceably along," replied he, "and was playing with my cane by twisting it round my body. By accident, one of the ends slipped out of my hand, when I was opposite the gate, just by the wooden bridge, where the ill-natured fellow had put down a pitcher of water, which he was taking home from the well.

4．"It so happened that my cane, in springing back, upset the pitcher, but did not break it. He came up close to me, and began to call me names, when I assured(6) him that what I had done had happened by accident, and that I was sorry for it. Without regarding(7) what I said, he instantly seized my cane, and twisted it, as you see; but I will make him repent of it."

5．"To be sure," said Stephen, "he is a very wicked boy, and is already very properly punished for being such, since nobody likes him or will have anything to do with him. He can scarcely find a companion to play with him; and is often at a loss for amusement, as he deserves to be. This, properly considered(8), I think will appear sufficient revenge for you."

6．"All this is true," replied Philip, "but he has broken my cane. It was a present from my father, and a very pretty cane it was. I offered to fill his pitcher for him again, as I knocked it down by accident. I will be revenged."

7．"Now, Philip;" said Stephen, "I think you will act better in not minding him, as your contempt(9) will be the best punishment you can inflict(10)upon him. Be assured, he will always be able to do more mischief to you than you choose to do to him. And, now I think of it, I will tell you what happened to him not long since.

8．"Very unluckily for him, he chanced to see a bee hovering(11) about a flower which he caught, and was going to pull off its wings out of sport, when the animal stung him, and flew away in safety to the hive. The pain put him into a furious passion, and, like you, he vowed revenge. He accordingly procured a stick, and thrust it into the beehive.

9．"In an instant the whole swarm flew out, and alighting upon him stung him in a hundred different places. He uttered the most piercing cries, and rolled upon the ground in the excess of his agony(12). His father immediately ran to him, but could not put the bees to flight until they had stung him so severely that he was confined several days to his bed.

10．"Thus, you see, he was not very successful in his pursuit of revenge. I would advise you, therefore, to pass over his insult. He is a wicked boy, and much stronger than you; so that your ability(13) to obtain this revenge may be doubtful."

11．"I must own," replied Philip, "that your advice seems very good. So come along with me, and I will tell my father the whole matter, and I think he will not be angry with me." They went, and Philip told his father what had happened. He thanked Stephen for the good advice he had given his son, and promised Philip to give him another cane exactly like the first.

12．A few days afterward, Philip saw this ill-natured boy fall as he was carrying home a heavy log of wood, which he could not lift up again. Philip ran to him, and helped him to replace it on his shoulder. Young Robinson was quite ashamed at the thought of this unmerited kindness, and heartily repented of his behavior. Philip went home quite satisfied. "This," said he, "is the noblest vengeance I could take, in returning good for evil. It is impossible I should repent of it."

1．“我要找他报仇，我一定会的，要让他感到由衷的忏悔。”菲利普自言自语道，脸由于生气而显得格外红。他想得太投入了，以至于没看见斯蒂芬。斯蒂芬正是来见他的。

2．“那人是谁，”斯蒂芬说，“你打算找谁报仇？”菲利普仿佛这才如梦初醒，突然停了下来，看着他的朋友，但很快恢复了他自然的微笑表情。“哈，”他说道，“你还记得我的竹子吧，我父亲给我的一段非常漂亮的竹藤，记得吗？看！它已经成碎片了。是农民罗宾逊的儿子把它弄得这样一钱不值的。”

3．斯蒂芬非常冷静地问他是什么导致小罗宾逊把它打碎了。“我平静地走着，”他回答说，“边走边把玩着我的竹藤，把它缠在我身上。突然发生了意外，竹藤的一端从我手里滑了出去。当时我正在门外的木桥旁，而那个坏脾气的家伙刚刚把一罐子水放在地上，那是他从井里打完要带回家的。”

4．“说来也巧，我的竹藤回弹时打到了那个罐子，但没有把它打破。他就凑了上来，开始点名道姓地骂我，我向他保证我刚才的动作是个意外，我很抱歉。他根本不管我说什么，上来就抓起我的竹藤，你也看见了，把它扭断了；但我会让他为此感到后悔的。”

5．“可以肯定，”斯蒂芬说，“他是个很可恶的孩子，成为这么一个没人喜欢、没人愿意和他有任何关系的人对他来说已经是个合适的惩罚了。他根本找不到愿意和他一起玩的伙伴，而且通常对娱乐一窍不通，他活该。好好想想吧，这对你来说已经足够报仇雪恨了。”

6．“这些都是事实，”菲利普回答，“但是他弄断了我的竹藤。那是我父亲送的礼物，而且也非常漂亮。我提出要把水罐装满，因为我不小心把它碰倒了。我要报仇。”

7．“现在，菲利普，”斯蒂芬说，“我认为你不去和他一般见识会更好，因为你的蔑视是你能够惩罚他的最佳方式。放心吧，他总能对你做更多的恶作剧，远比你要对他做得多。现在我想到这个，我告诉你不久前在他身上发生了什么。”

8．“对他来说非常不幸，他偶然看到了一只蜜蜂在花上盘旋，他抓住了它，要把它的翅膀扯下来。这时蜜蜂叮了他一下，安全地飞回了蜂箱。疼痛让他怒不可遏，像你一样，他发誓要报仇。于是，他找来一根棍子，戳进了蜂箱。”

9．“顷刻间，整个蜂群飞了出来，落在他身上，叮了他一百多处。他发出了最尖利的哭喊声，过度痛苦使得他在地上打起滚来。他父亲立刻跑来，但是根本没办法赶走蜜蜂，直到它们把他叮得严重到不得不卧床很多天。”

10．“你看，他期望的报仇并不成功。因此，我建议你忽略他对你的侮辱。他是个坏孩子，又比你强壮，那么你来实施报复的能力就值得怀疑。”

11．“我必须承认，”菲利普回答道，“你的建议非常好。随我来吧，我会把一切告诉父亲，我想他不会生我的气。”他们离开，菲利普告诉父亲发生了什么。他父亲感谢斯蒂芬给他儿子的建议，并且答应给菲利普一个完全一样的竹藤。

12．之后几天，菲利普看到这个坏脾气的男孩在往家里搬一块很沉的木柴时摔倒在地，再也抬不起来。菲利普跑到他身边，帮他把木柴扛在肩上。小罗宾逊想到这份好意时感到非常惭愧，发自内心地对自己的行为表示后悔。菲利普心里非常满足地回到家。“这，”他说，“是我进行的最高尚的复仇，以德报怨。我是不会为此后悔的。”

LESSON 34

EVENING HYMN

夜晚圣歌


1．Come to the sunset tree,

The day is past and gone;

The woodman's ax lies free,

And the reaper's work is done;

The twilight star to heaven,

And the summer dew to flowers,

And rest to us is given,

By the soft evening hours.

2．Sweet is the hour of rest,

Pleasant the woods' low sigh,

And the gleaming of the west,

And the turf whereon we lie,

When the burden and the heat

Of the laborer's task is o'er,

And kindly voices greet

The tired one at the door.

3．Yes, tuneful is the sound

That dwells in whispering boughs:

Welcome the freshness round,

And the gale that fans our brows;

But rest more sweet and still

Than ever the nightfall gave,

Our yearning hearts shall fill,

In the world beyond the grave.

4．There, shall no tempests blow,

Nor scorching noontide heat;

There, shall be no more snow,

No weary, wandering feet;

So we lift our trusting eyes

From the hills our fathers trod,

To the quiet of the skies,

To the Sabbath of our God.





【中文阅读】


1．来到落日树旁，

白天一去不复返；

伐木工的斧头随意躺着，

收割者的工作已经完成；

暮色里的星星挂在天边。

到了柔和的傍晚时间，

我们也可以休息了。

2．休息的时光是甜蜜的，

树木的低声叹息是多么令人愉快，

西边闪着光芒，

当劳动者工作的负担和高温已经结束，

我们躺在草地上，

亲切的声音在门口

问候着疲惫的人儿。

3．是的，低语的枝头间存在

和谐悦耳的声音；

欢迎周围新鲜的感觉，

以及吹拂额头的一阵风，

但是夜晚给予的

安稳更加甜蜜、宁静，

我们热切的内心仍然满足，

在死后的另一个世界。

4．那里，不会刮起大风暴，

也不会有正午灼人的热浪；

那里，不会下雪，

没有疲惫、徘徊的双脚；

因此我们从父辈涉足的山顶，

抬起信任的眼睛，

为了天空的寂静，

为了我神的安息。





LESSON 35

HOW MARGERY WONDERED

好奇的玛芝莉


1．One bright morning late in March, little Margery put on her hood and her Highland plaid shawl, and went trudging(1) across the beach. It was the first time she had been trusted out alone, for Margery was a little girl; nothing about her was large, except her round gray eyes, which had yet scarcely opened upon half a dozen springs and summers.

2．There was a pale mist on the far-off sea and sky, and up around the sun were white clouds edged with the hues(2) of pinks and violets. The sunshine and the mild air made Margery's very heart feel warm, and she let the soft wind blow aside her Highland shawl, as she looked across the waters at the sun, and wondered! For, somehow, the sun had never looked before as it did to-day; —it seemed like a great golden flower bursting out of its pearl-lined calyx(3), —a flower without a stem. Or was there a strong stem away behind it in the sky, that reached down below the sea, to a root, nobody could guess where?

3．Margery did not stop to puzzle herself about the answer to her question, for now the tide was coming in, and the waves, little at first, but growing larger every moment, were crowding up along the sand and pebbles, laughing, winking, and whispering, as they tumbled over each other, like thousands of children hurrying home from somewhere, each with its own precious little secret to tell.

4．Where did the waves come from? Who was down there under the blue wall of the horizon(4), with the hoarse, hollow voice, urging and pushing them across the beach at her feet? And what secret was it they were lisping to each other with their pleasant voices? Oh, what was there beneath the sea, and beyond the sea, so deep, so broad, and so dim, too, away off where the white ships, that looked smaller than sea birds, were gliding out and in?



5．But while Margery stood still for a moment on a dry rock, and wondered, there came a low, rippling warble(5) to her ear from a cedar tree on the cliff above her. It had been a long winter, and Margery had forgotten that there were birds, and that birds could sing. So she wondered again what the music was.

6．And when she saw the bird perched on a yellow-brown bough, she wondered yet more. It was only a bluebird, but then it was the first bluebird Margery had ever seen. He fluttered among the prickly twigs, and looked as if he had grown out of them, as the cedar berries had, which were dusty blue, the color of his coat. But how did the music get in his throat? And after it was in his throat, how could it untangle itself, and wind itself off so evenly? And where had the bluebird flown from, across the snow banks down to the shore of the blue sea?

7．The waves sang a welcome to him, and he sang a welcome to the waves; they seemed to know each other well; and the ripple and the warble sounded so much alike, the bird and the wave must have both learned their music of the same teacher. And Margery kept on wondering as she stepped between the song of the bluebird and the echo of the sea, and climbed a sloping bank, just turning faintly green in the spring sunshine.

8．The grass was surely beginning to grow! There were fresh, juicy shoots running up among the withered blades of last year, as if in hopes of bringing them back to life; and closer down she saw the sharp points of new spears(6) peeping from their sheaths(7). And scattered here and there were small, dark green leaves folded around buds shut up so tightly that only those who had watched them many seasons could tell what flowers were to be let out of their safe prisons by and by. So no one could blame Margery for not knowing that they were only common things, nor for stooping over the tiny buds, and wondering.

9．What made the grass come up so green out of the black earth? And how did the buds know when it was time to take off their little green hoods, and see what there was in the world around them? And how came they to be buds at all? Did they bloom in another world before they sprung up here?—and did they know, themselves, what kind of flowers they should blossom into? Had flowers souls, like little girls, that would live in another world when their forms had faded away in this?

10．Margery thought she would like to sit down on the bank, and wait beside the buds until they opened; perhaps they would tell her their secret if the very first thing they saw was her eyes watching them. One bud was beginning to unfold; it was streaked with yellow in little stripes that she could imagine became wider every minute. But she would not touch it, for it seemed almost as much alive as herself. She only wondered, and wondered!

11．Margery heard her mother calling her, and she trudged home across the shells and pebbles with a pleasant smile dimpling her cheeks; for she felt very much at home in this large, wonderful world, and was happy to be alive, although she neither could have told, nor cared to know, the reason why. But when her mother unpinned the little girl's Highland shawl, and took off her hood, she said, "O mother, do let me live on the doorstep! I don't like houses to stay in. What makes everything so pretty and so glad? Don't you like to wonder?"

12．Margery's mother was a good woman. But then there was all the housework to do, and, if she had thoughts, she did not often let them wander outside of the kitchen door. And just now she was baking some gingerbread, which was in danger of getting burned in the oven. So she pinned the shawl around the child's neck again, and left her on the doorstep, saying to herself, as she returned to her work, "Queer child! I wonder what kind of a woman she will be!"

13．But Margery sat on the doorstep, and wondered, as the sea sounded louder, and the sunshine grew warmer around her. It was all so strange, and grand, and beautiful! Her heart danced with joy to the music that went echoing through the wide world from the roots of the sprouting grass to the great golden blossom of the sun.

14．And when the round, gray eyes closed that night, at the first peep of the stars, the angels looked down and wondered over Margery. For the wisdom of the wisest being God has made, ends in wonder; and there is nothing on earth so wonderful as the budding soul of a little child.



(Lucy Larcom)



EXERCISES.—Name the things about which Margery wondered. What did she wonder about each? What is still more wonderful than all that at which Margery wondered?





【中文阅读】


1．三月下旬一个明媚的早晨，小玛芝莉戴上兜帽，披上格子花呢披肩，步履沉重地沿着海滩走着。这是玛芝莉第一次单独出门，因为她是个很小的小女孩，除了圆圆的灰色大眼睛，她的五官都不大。在过去的六个春夏秋冬，她几乎都没见过什么。

2．遥远的海边和天空中都飘着一层白雾，太阳四周围绕着白云，全都镶上了粉红和紫罗兰色的云边。阳光和轻柔的空气让玛芝莉感觉心头暖暖的，当她的眼神穿过大海望向太阳时，感觉不可思议，让微风吹动着她的格子披肩。不知怎么回事，太阳似乎从来没像今天这个样子——它看起来像是一朵巨大的金色花朵——一支没有根茎的花，从珍珠色的花萼里开放，抑或是在天空后面有一只强大的根茎，一直伸向海底扎根，没人能猜到在哪儿。

3．玛芝莉并没有停下来为思考自己提出的问题而伤脑筋，因为现在潮水已经涨上来了。还有波浪，最初很小，但随后每时每刻都在变大，沿着沙子和鹅卵石奔涌上来，欢笑地，迅速地，悄悄地，它们一浪接一浪地跌落，像成千上万个孩子从某个地方跑回家，每个人都有自己的小秘密要诉说。

4．波浪是从哪里来的？谁在蓝色的水平线下发出沙哑的声音，催促它们，推动它们穿过海滩来到她脚下？它们用甜美的嗓音囫囵说着什么秘密？哦，海的下面是什么，海的尽头是什么，那么深邃，那么宽广，又那么朦胧。远处白色的船舶，看起来似乎比海鸟还渺小，是不是正在航行着？

5．但是当玛芝莉在一块干燥的大石头上驻足片刻，发出感叹时，一阵低低的柔和的鸟鸣声如流水泛起涟漪般从悬崖边的雪松树上传到她的耳朵里。这是一个漫长的冬天，玛芝莉已经忘记了树上还有鸟儿，鸟儿还会歌唱。所以她又想知道那是什么音乐。

6．当她看到鸟儿栖息在棕黄色的树枝上，她想了解得更多了。它仅仅是一只蓝色知更鸟，但却是玛芝莉见到的第一只蓝色知更鸟。它在长满刺的细枝上拍打翅膀，看起来像是从树上长出来的一样。因为雪松树表皮上的灰蓝色和鸟儿身上的颜色极为相近。但是音乐是如何进到它喉咙里的呢？进入它的喉咙里之后，又是怎么能自己解扣，然后匀速地释放出来呢？蓝色知更鸟是从哪里飞来的呢？飞过白雪覆盖的海岸，又飞到蔚蓝的大海边？

7．海浪歌唱着欢迎它，它对海浪唱出欢迎之歌；它们似乎对彼此都非常了解，海浪泛起涟漪的声音和鸟儿歌唱的声音听起来是那么相似，鸟儿和海浪一定师从同一个老师学习过音乐。玛芝莉行走在蓝色知更鸟的歌声和海面的回声之间，还在不停地思考着。她爬上了一段倾斜的海岸，这里在春天的阳光下刚刚显现出淡淡绿意。

8．小草已经开始生长了！去年枯萎的叶片中冒出鲜嫩的新芽，仿佛希望它们能重获新生。凑到近前，她看到了新芽外鞘里依稀可见的芽间。四周分布着小小的深绿色叶子，将花蕾紧紧包裹在里面，只有那些观察过它们很多季的人才能辨别出不久以后从安全的‘监牢’里会开放出什么花朵。因此，没人会责怪玛芝莉不仅不知道那些只是平常之物，还弯腰好奇地去看小花蕾。

9．什么使得小草从黑色的土壤里长出来却长得这么绿油油呢？花蕾是如何知道该什么时候脱去它们绿色的斗篷，看看身边周遭世界的呢？它们到底又是怎么变成花蕾的呢？它们在这里发芽之前是否已经在另一个世界里开过花了呢？——它们自己是否清楚，它们将开出什么样的花朵？当它们的躯体在这个世界凋零后，花儿的灵魂是不是和小女孩的一样，会生活在另一个世界呢？

10．玛芝莉想她愿意坐在岸上，等在花蕾旁边，直到它们开放；也许当最先看到的是她注视的眼睛，它们会告诉她它们的秘密。一个花蕾正在慢慢绽开，上面长有黄色的细条纹，她能够想象它每分钟都在向外展开。但她不去碰它，因为它看上去和她自己一样，是有生命的。她只是在好奇地想啊，想啊！

11．玛芝莉听到妈妈在叫她，于是穿过布满贝壳和鹅卵石的岸边磕磕绊绊地往家里走。一丝满足的微笑浮现在她脸上，因为她在这个很大很奇妙的世界里感觉非常自由自在，也非常高兴能够活着，虽然她从来说不清为什么，也不在乎。但当妈妈解开小女孩的格子斗篷，摘下她的帽子时，她说：“哦，妈妈，让我住在门口吧！我不喜欢住在屋子里。是什么让一切如此美丽，如此美好？难道您不好奇吗？”

12．玛芝莉的妈妈是个善良的人。但所有的家务都要她做，只要她能想到，通常就不让他们在厨房外晃悠。刚才她正在烤箱里烤一些姜饼，眼看就有着火的危险了。所以她又把斗篷系在了孩子脖子上，把她放在门外台阶上。回去继续干活时她自言自语地说：“好奇怪的孩子！我很好奇她会变成什么样的女人。”

13．但玛芝莉坐在台阶上，思考着，大海的声音更响了，更温暖的阳光包围着她。一切都那么奇特，那么宏大，那么美丽！从发芽的草根到太阳开出的金色花朵，这样的音乐回响在浩淼的世界里，而她的心便随着这音乐欢快地舞动着。

14．那天夜里，当灰色的大圆眼睛闭上时，天使们伴随星星的出现低下头惊奇地看着玛芝莉。因为上帝创造出的最聪明的生物的智慧在惊奇中结束。世界上没有比小孩子萌芽的心灵更伟大的东西了。

It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,

And talks to itself on the tops of the hills.

With the wheat fields that nod, and the rivers that flow;

With cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles,

And people upon you for thousands of miles?

4．"Ah, you are so great, and I am so small,

I tremble to think of you, World, at all:

And yet, when I said my prayers, to-day,

You can love and think, and the Earth can not!'"

世界啊，我一想到你就感到颤抖，

那么，今天，当我在进行祈祷时，

一阵来自我内心深处的低语似乎在说：

你比地球更伟大，尽管你只是上面的一个小圆点，

但你能够去爱，去思考，地球做不到啊！”





LESSON 37

SUSIE'S COMPOSITION

苏西的作文


1．Susie Smith came home from school one day, and had no sooner entered the sitting room than she burst into tears. "What is the matter, my dear child?" said her mother, drawing her daughter to her side and smiling.

2．"O mother, matter enough," sobbed Susie. "All our class must bring in compositions(1) to-morrow morning, and I never, never can write one. We must write twelve lines at least, and I have written only a few words after trying nearly all the afternoon. See what work I have made of it!"

3．Mrs. Smith took the rumpled(2), tear-stained paper which Susie held in her hand, and glanced at what she had written. In a careful hand she had tried to write upon three themes(3): "Time," "Temperance," and "Industry."

4．"Time is short. We should all improve our time." "Temperance is a very useful thing." "We should all be industrious if we wish to do anything in the world." These sentences were all she had written.

5．"Now," said Susie, "I can't think of another word to say upon any of these subjects, and I know I shall have to go to school without a composition, for I won't be so mean as to copy one from a book, or to ask you or papa to write one for me."

6．"That is right, my dear," said her mother. "You will be far happier with a poor composition, if it is all your own, than with a fine one written by somebody else. But cheer up. You have not begun right—you have been trying to write upon subjects that you know nothing about. Run into the garden and play. I will call you in half an hour."

7．"But my composition," began Susie. "Don't think about your composition while you are gone," said Mrs. Smith, "but have as pleasant a time as you can."

8．It seemed but a few minutes to Susie before she heard her mother's voice calling her. She went into the house at once—her hands full of sweet flowers, and her cheeks rosy with exercise.

9．"Now, Susie," said her mother, "I want you to sit by the window with this nice sheet of paper and a pencil, and write something about what you can see." "But my composition, mother," said Susie; "when shall I begin that?" "Never mind your composition, my dear; do this to please me, and we will talk about that by and by."

10．Susie thought her mother's request(4) was a strange one; but she knew that she always had a good reason for everything she did: so she took the paper and pencil, and sat by the window.

11．"Do not talk to me at all," said her mother. "Look out of the window, and then write down your thoughts about everything you see."

12．Susie could not help laughing, it seemed such a funny thing to be doing. As she looked out, she first saw the western sky and some bright, sunset clouds. "O mother!" she exclaimed, "what a splendid sunset!" "Don't talk," said her mother, "but write."



13．"I'll write about the sunset, then," said she, and the pencil began to move rapidly across the paper. In a few moments she said, "Mother, shall I read you what I have written?" "No, not now," answered her mother; "I am going into the dining room. You may sit and write until I return."

14．As Susie went on writing, she became very much interested in her occupation(5), and for a time forgot all about the dreaded composition. She wrote about the sunset clouds, the appearance of the distant hills, the trees, the river, the garden with its gay flowers, and the birds flying past the window.

15．Just as she had reached the bottom of the page, her mother came in. "Well, Susie," said she, with a smile, "how does that composition come on?" "Composition!" exclaimed Susie; "you told me not to think about my composition, and I have not thought of it once; I have had such a nice time writing about what I could see from the window."

16．Mrs. Smith took the paper and read aloud what Susie had written: "I am sitting on a low seat at the bay window, one half of which is open, so that I can smell the sweet flowers in the garden. The sky is all bright with sunset; I can see purple, and pink, and golden. I do not believe that any one on earth has a paint box with such lovely colors in it.

17．"I can see one cloud, far above the rest, that looks like a ship sailing in the blue sea. I should like to sail on a cloud, if it would not make me dizzy. Now, while I have been writing, the clouds have changed in color and form, but they are just as beautiful as they were before.

18．"The green hills are tipped with light, and look as if they were wearing golden crowns. I can see a river a great way off, and it looks quite still, although I know it is running as fast as it can to get to the ocean.

19．"The birds are flying past the window to go home and take care of their little ones. I am glad the birds are not afraid to live in our garden, and to build nests in our trees.

20．"Our garden is full of flowers—pinks, lilies, and roses. Mother calls this the month of roses. My birthday will come in a week, and we can have all the flowers we wish for wreaths and bouquets(6)."

21．"There, Susie," said Mrs. Smith, "that is a very nice composition, indeed." "A composition!" exclaimed Susie, "is that a composition?" "Yes, my dear, and a very good one, too," replied her mother. "When it hasn't even a subject?"

22．"We can find one for it, and I do not doubt it will please your teacher, as it does me. You see, my dear," continued her mother, "that it is easy enough to write if you have anything interesting to write about."

23．The next morning Susie copied her composition very neatly, and started to school with a happy heart, saying, as she gave her mother a kiss, "Just think how funny it is, dear mother, that I should have written so long a composition without knowing it."



EXERCISES.—What is a composition? Why was Susie so troubled? Why could she not write about "Time," "Temperance," or "Industry"? What did her mother have her do? What did Susie write? Was it a composition? Did she know, at the time, that it was? What fault did she find with it? Can you give her composition a proper subject?

1．一天，苏西·史密斯从学校回到家，一进客厅就泪流满面地哭了起来。“因为什么事啊，我亲爱的宝贝？”妈妈把女儿拉到身边，微笑着说。

2．“哦，妈妈，相当重要的事，”苏西抽泣着，“我们班上的所有学生明天都必须带去一篇作文，而我一直写不出来。我们要写至少12行，我整个下午只写了几个词。您看看我写出来的。”

3．史密斯夫人接过苏西手里拿着的那张皱巴巴、沾满泪水的纸张，飞快地看了一眼她已经写下的东西。她很认真的试图展开写三个主题：“时间”，“自制”和“勤奋”。

4．“时间很短暂。我们应该改善对时间的利用。”“自制是非常有用的事。”“如果我们想在世界上做成任何事都要勤奋。”这些是所有她写下来的句子。

5．“现在，”苏西说，“我想不出任何与这些主题相关的其他词语了，我想明天上学我肯定交不了作文了，因为我也不会恶劣到从书上抄一篇，或是让您或爸爸给我写一篇。”

6．“那就对了，我的宝贝，”妈妈说，“只要是你自己写出的作文，就算稍微差些，你也会感觉比别人给你写一篇快乐得多。振作起来。你的开头没有写好——你一直在想写些你不了解的主题。去花园里跑跑玩玩吧。半小时后我叫你回来。”

7．“那我的作文，”苏西开口问。“去玩儿的时候别想着你的作文，”史密斯夫人说，“尽可能玩得高兴点。”

8．苏西感觉只玩了一小会儿就听到了妈妈喊她的声音。她立刻回到屋里——手上握满鲜花，脸颊因为运动而红扑扑的。

9．“苏西，现在，”妈妈说，“我要你坐在窗边，拿一张干净的纸、一根上好的笔，写些你能看见的东西。”“妈，但是我的作文，”苏西说，“我什么时候开始写？”“亲爱的，不要在意你的作文。照我说的做，我会很高兴的。我们过一会儿再说作文。”

10．苏西认为妈妈的请求很奇怪，但她知道妈妈做的每件事总有她的道理，所以她拿了纸和笔，坐在了窗前。

11．“千万不要和我说话，”妈妈说，“向窗外看去，然后写下关于你看到的一切的想法。”

12．苏西不禁笑了起来，感觉要做的事十分好笑。她向外看去，首先看到了西边的天空和一些明亮的日落云。“噢，妈！”她大叫道，“多么灿烂的落日啊！”“别说话，”妈妈说，“只管写。”

13．“那么，我就写写日落吧，”她说，铅笔开始在纸上快速地移动起来。不一会儿，她说：“妈，我可以给您念念我写的东西么？”“不，现在还不行，”妈妈回答，“我要去厨房。你就坐在这儿写，直到我回来。”

14．苏西继续写着，她开始对这个工作产生兴趣了，在一段时间里忘记了那篇烦人的作文。她写了落日云，远处山上的外景，树木，河流，开满艳丽花朵的花园，飞过窗外的鸟儿。

15．就在她要写到纸的最后一行时，妈妈走了进来。“那么，苏西，”她微笑着说，“作文进行得怎么样了？”“作文！”苏西叫道，“您说让我不要想作文，我根本一点都没想。我写窗外看到的东西时感觉非常快乐。”

16．史密斯夫人拿起纸，大声地朗读苏西写下的文字：“我坐在窗边的矮凳上，窗子半开着，这样我可以闻到花园里的花香。天空被落日点亮；我可以看到紫色、粉色和金色。我相信世界上没人拥有这样的一个颜料盒，里面能有这么迷人的颜色。”

17．“我能看到一朵云，远远高于其他的云，它像一艘小船航行在碧蓝的大海里。如果它不会让我眩晕的话，我会喜欢坐在云朵上航行。现在，就在我写这些的时候，云朵已经改变了颜色和形状，但它们都和之前一样美丽。”

18．“翠绿的山顶闪着光，看起来好像戴上了绿色的皇冠。我能看见一条河从高处流下来，虽然我知道它在速度很快地流向大海，但看起来像静止一般。”

19．“鸟儿在回家途中飞过窗边，悉心照顾着小鸟们。我很高兴鸟儿们不害怕住在我们花园里，在我们的树上筑巢。”

20．“我们的花园开满了鲜花——石竹、百合和玫瑰。妈妈管这个月叫玫瑰月。再过一周就是我的生日了，我们可以弄来所有想要的花来做花环和花束。”

21．“苏西，”史密斯夫人说，“这就是一篇非常好的作文。”“一篇作文！”苏西叫道，“这就是一篇作文？”“是的，我的宝贝，还是一篇非常好的。”妈妈回答。“连主题都没有？”

22．“我们可以找个主题，我一点都不怀疑老师会喜欢这篇文章，就像让我喜欢一样。你看，亲爱的，”妈妈继续说，“如果有你感兴趣的事可写，写作是相当容易的。”

23．第二天早上，苏西将作文整齐地誊抄了一遍，心情愉快地去上学，并给了妈妈一个吻。“亲爱的妈妈，想起来多可笑啊，我本可以在毫无察觉的情况下写下这么长的一篇作文。”

LESSON 38

THE SUMMER SHOWER

夏季的雨


The author, Thomas Buchanan Read, was born in Chester Co., Pa., March 12, 1822. His life was devoted to the fine arts, and he attained a high reputation both as artist and poet. He died in New York, May 11, 1872.

1．Before the stout harvesters falleth the grain,

As when the strong stormwind is reaping the plain,

And loiters the boy in the briery lane;

But yonder aslant(1) comes the silvery rain,

Like a long line of spears brightly burnished and tall.

2．Adown the white highway(2) like cavalry fleet,

It dashes the dust with its numberless feet.

Like a murmurless school, in their leafy retreat(3),

The wild birds sit listening the drops round them beat;

And the boy crouches(4) close to the blackberry wall.

3．The swallows alone take the storm on the wing,

And, taunting(5) the tree-sheltered laborers, sing.

Like pebbles the rain breaks the face of the spring,

While a bubble darts up from each widening ring;

And the boy in dismay hears the loud shower fall.

4．But soon are the harvesters tossing their sheaves;

The robin darts out from his bower of leaves;

The wren peereth forth from the moss-covered eaves;

And the rain-spattered urchin(6) now gladly perceives

That the beautiful bow bendeth over them all.

1．在强壮的收割机割断庄稼之前，

当猛烈的暴风席卷平原大地，

男孩在荆棘密布的小路上游荡；

但银色的雨丝倾斜着出现在了那边，

像极了一条条又高又亮的长矛，排成长线。

2．顺着白色的高速路，像骑兵的队伍，

无数的脚步溅起尘土。

像一所听不到沙沙声的学校，

野外的鸟儿坐听雨滴落在它们身边噼啪作响；

男孩蹲在临近长满黑莓的墙边。

3．唯独燕子用翅膀迎接暴风雨，

它们用歌声嘲笑着在树下避雨的工人们。

雨儿像鹅卵石一样打破了春天的面孔，

而每个绽开的圆圈都形成一个气泡；

沮丧中的男孩听到了大雨倾泻而下的声音。

4．但收割机很快开始转动它们的滑车轮；

知更鸟从树叶的荫庇下冲出来，

鹪鹩从覆盖着苔藓的屋檐下向前探头，

溅了一身雨水的淘气鬼现在高兴地想到，

漂亮的彩虹吸引了它们全部的注意力。

LESSON 39

CONSEQUENCES OF IDLENESS

懒惰的后果


1．Many young persons seem to think it of not much consequence(1) if they do not improve their time well in youth, vainly expecting that they can make it up by diligence when they are older. They also think it is disgraceful for men and women to be idle, but that there can be no harm for persons who are young to spend their time in any manner they please.

2．George Jones thought so. When he was twelve years old, he went to an academy(2) to prepare to enter college(3). His father was at great expense in obtaining books for him, clothing him, and paying his tuition. But George was idle. The preceptor(4) of the academy would often tell him that if he did not study diligently when young he would never succeed well.

3．But George thought of nothing but present pleasure. He would often go to school without having made any preparation(5) for his morning lesson; and, when called to recite with his class, he would stammer and make such blunders that the rest of the class could not help laughing at him. He was one of the poorest scholars in the school, because he was one of the most idle.

4．When recess came, and all the boys ran out of the academy upon the playground, idle George would come moping along. Instead of studying diligently while in school, he was indolent and half asleep. When the proper time for play came, he had no relish for it. I recollect very well, that, when "tossing up" for a game of ball, we used to choose everybody on the playground before we chose George; and if there were enough without him we used to leave him out. Thus he was unhappy in school and out of school.

5．There is nothing which makes a person enjoy play so well as to study hard. When recess was over, and the rest of the boys returned, fresh and vigorous(6), to their studies, George might be seen lagging and moping along to his seat. Sometimes he would be asleep in school; sometimes he would pass his time in catching flies, and penning them up in little holes, which he cut in his seat; and sometimes, when the preceptor's back was turned, he would throw a paper ball across the room.

6．When the class was called up to recite, George would come drowsily along, looking as mean and ashamed as though he were going to be whipped. The rest of the class stepped up to the recitation with alacrity(7), and appeared happy and contented. When it came George's turn to recite, he would be so long in doing it, and make such blunders, that all most heartily wished him out of the class.

7．At last, George went with his class to enter college. Though he passed a very poor examination, he was admitted with the rest; for those who examined him thought it was possible that the reason why he did not answer questions better was because he was frightened. Now came hard times for poor George. In college there is not much mercy shown to bad scholars; and George had neglected his studies so long that he could not now keep up with his class, let him try ever so hard.

8．He could, without much difficulty, get along in the academy, where there were only two or three boys of his own class to laugh at him. But now he had to go into a large recitation room, filled with students from all parts of the country. In the presence of all these, he must rise and recite to a professor(8). Poor fellow! He paid dearly for his idleness.

9．You would have pitied him if you could have seen him trembling in his seat, every moment expecting to be called upon to recite. And when he was called upon, he would stand up and take what the class called a "dead set;" that is, he could not recite at all. Sometimes he would make such ludicrous(9) blunders that the whole class would burst into a laugh. Such are the applauses(10) an idler gets. He was wretched, of course. He had been idle so long that he hardly knew how to apply his mind to study. All the good scholars avoided him; they were ashamed to be seen in his company. He became discouraged, and gradually grew dissipated(11).

10．The officers of the college were soon compelled to suspend him. He returned in a few months, but did no better; and his father was then advised to take him from college. He left college, despised by everyone. A few months ago, I met him, a poor wanderer, without money and without friends. Such are the wages of idleness. I hope every reader will, from this history, take warning, and "stamp improvement(12) on the wings of time."





【中文阅读】


1．许多年轻人似乎认为，如果年轻时不善于管理时间，并不会产生什么不良后果，只是徒劳地寄希望于长大后通过勤奋进行弥补。他们还认为懒惰对于男人和女人来说都是件不光彩的事，但对于年轻人来说，用他们自己喜欢的任何方式安排时间都是没有大碍的。

2．乔治·琼斯就是这么想的。当他12岁时，进入专科学校学习，为考大学做准备。他父亲花了很多钱为他准备书本、衣服和交学费。但是乔治总是很懒散。学校的老师总会告诉他，如果年轻时不努力学习，将来就不会有所成就。

3．但是乔治什么都不想，只想着眼前的快乐。他经常不做任何预习就去学校上早课；而叫他背诵时，他就会结结巴巴地犯错误，其他同学们都忍不住要笑话他。他在学校是成绩最差的学生，就因为他总是懒惰。

4．课间休息时间到了，所有的男孩都跑出教室，到操场上去，懒惰的乔治总是没精打采地挪过去。上课时他总是处于半睡半醒的懒惰状态，不认真学习。当真正玩耍的时间到了，他也不能享受其中的乐趣。我记得非常清楚，每当玩球“抛硬币”分组时，我们通常会在选择了操场上的每个人之后再选乔治；如果不用选他，人数已经够了，我们就把他甩在一边。这样一来，他在课上和课下都很不快乐。

5．对一个人来说，没有比努力学习之后更能享受玩耍的乐趣了。课间休息结束，其他的男孩子都精神饱满，活力无限地回去继续学习，而乔治总是走得很慢，磨磨蹭蹭地回到他的座位上。有时候他会在课堂上睡觉；有时候他会用抓苍蝇来打发时间，然后把它们关在他在椅子上刻出的小洞里。还有些时候，当老师转过身去，他会把一个纸团扔到教室的另一边。

6．当老师叫同学们背诵时，乔治总是迷迷糊糊地跟着，看上去非常差劲，令人惭愧，仿佛要挨鞭子似的。其他同学加快了背诵的速度，看起来非常愉快，让人满意。当轮到乔治背诵时，他要花上很长时间，犯很多错，以至于所有人都由衷地希望把他赶出教室。

7．最终，乔治和他的同学们一起进入了大学。尽管他的考试成绩很差，但他也和其他同学一起被录取了。原因是那个考察他的老师认为，他没回答好问题可能是因为他太害怕，太紧张了。现在，可怜的乔治的艰难时刻来临了。大学里对于差学生可没那么仁慈了。乔治放松学习的时间太长，所以他已经跟不上上课进度了，让他更努力地试试吧。

8．在专科学校时，他和别人相处并不难，因为班里只有两三个男生笑话他。但是现在他要进到一间非常大的诵读室里，里面坐着来自全国各地的学生。在所有这些情形下，他必须站起来，面对教授背诵。可怜的家伙！他为懒惰付出了高昂的代价。

9．如果你看见他在颤抖中时刻等待被点名背诵时，你一定会可怜他。当叫到他时，他站起身，采取被同学们戏称为“死套路”的办法，也就是说，他根本不能背诵。有时他会犯一些非常莫名其妙的错误，全班顿时笑成一片。这是对懒惰者喝的倒彩。当然，他也很不幸。由于懒散了太长时间，他甚至不知道该如何将脑子用在学习上。所有的好学生都躲着他，大家都觉得和他在一起很丢脸。他变得心灰意冷，开始慢慢地自暴自弃。

10．很快，学校的领导不得不让他停课。几个月后，他回到学校，但并没有好转。有人建议他父亲把他从学校带走，所以他在每个人的鄙视中离开了大学校园。几个月前，我偶然遇到了他，一个可怜的流浪者，没有钱也没有朋友。这些就是懒惰者的代价。我希望每位读者能用这则故事的内容引以为戒，要“在时间的翅膀上记录下你进步的印记”。

LESSON 40

ADVANTAGES OF INDUSTRY

勤奋的益处


1．I gave you, in the last lesson, the history(1) of George Jones, an idle boy, and showed you the consequences of his idleness. I shall now give you the history of Charles Bullard, a classmate of George. Charles was about the same age as George, and did not possess superior talents. Indeed, I doubt whether he was equal to him in natural powers of mind.

2．But Charles was a hard student. When quite young, he was always careful and diligent in school. Sometimes, when there was a very hard lesson, instead of going out to play during recess, he would stay in to study. He had resolved that his first object should be to get his lessons well, and then he could play with a good conscience(2). He loved play as well as anybody, and was one of the best players on the ground. I hardly ever saw any boy catch a ball better than he could. When playing any game(3), everyone was glad to get Charles on his side.

3．I have said that Charles would sometimes stay in at recess. This, however, was very seldom; it was only when the lessons were very hard indeed. Generally, he was among the first on the playground, and he was also among the first to go into school when called. Hard study gave him a relish for play, and play again gave him a relish for hard study; so he was happy both in school and out. The preceptor could not help liking him,

for he always had his lessons well committed(4), and never gave him any trouble.

4．When he went to enter college, the preceptor gave him a good recommendation(5). He was able to answer all the questions which were put to him when he was examined. He had studied so well when he was in the academy, and was so thoroughly prepared for college, that he found it very easy to keep up with his class, and had much time for reading interesting books.

5．But he would always get his lesson well before he did anything else, and would review(6) it just before recitation. When called upon to recite, he rose tranquil(7) and happy, and very seldom made mistakes. The officers of the college had a high opinion of him, and he was respected by all the students.

6．There was, in the college, a society made up of all the best scholars. Charles was chosen a member of that society. It was the custom to choose some one of the society to deliver a public address every year. This honor was conferred(8) on Charles; and he had studied so diligently, and read so much, that he delivered an address which was very interesting to all who heard it.

7．At last he graduated(9), as it is called; that is, he finished his collegiate course, and received his degree. It was known by all that he was a good scholar, and by all that he was respected. His father and mother, brothers and sisters, came on the commencement(10) day to hear him speak.

8．They all felt gratified, and loved Charles more than ever. Many situations of usefulness and profit were opened to him; for Charles was now an intelligent man, and universally(11) respected. He is still a useful and a happy man. He has a cheerful home, and is esteemed by all who know him.

9．Such are the rewards of industry. How strange it is that any person should be willing to live in idleness, when it will certainly make him unhappy! The idle boy is almost invariably(12) poor and miserable; the industrious boy is happy and prosperous.

10．But perhaps some child who reads this, asks, "Does God notice little children in school?" He certainly does. And if you are not diligent in the improvement of your time, it is one of the surest evidences(13) that your heart is not right with God. You are placed in this world to improve your time. In youth you must be preparing for future usefulness. And if you do not improve the advantages(14) you enjoy, you sin against your Maker.

With books, or work, or healthful play,

Let your first years be passed;

That you may give, for every day,

Some good account, at last.



EXERCISES.—What was the character of George Jones? Of Charles Bullard? How did George appear in the class at school? How did he behave at recess? How did Charles differ from him in these respects? Relate what happened when George went to college. What became of him? Did Charles succeed at college? Which of them do you think more worthy of imitation? What is said of the idle? What is said of the industrious? Who watches all our actions wherever we may be? For what are we placed in this world? Should you not then be diligent in your studies?

1．上篇课文中，我给你们讲了懒惰的孩子乔治·琼斯的经历，指出了他懒散的不良后果。现在我要给你们讲讲乔治的同学——查尔斯·布拉德——的故事。查尔斯和乔治同岁，并没有什么过人的天资。事实上，我都不确定在自然的脑力方面他能否比得上乔治。

2．但查尔斯是个努力的学生。很小的时候，他就认真勤奋地学习。有时当遇到很有难度的课程时，他在课间休息时不去玩耍而是留在室内继续学习。他认定了自己的第一目标是把课文学好，然后才毫无顾虑地去玩儿。和任何人一样，他也喜欢玩，而且在操场上是最好的选手之一。我没见过其他人接球比他接得更好。做游戏时，大家都愿意和查尔斯在一组。

3．我刚才说道，查尔斯有时课间会待在屋里。但这种情况很少发生，只有在课程的确非常难时才会这样。总的来说，他都是第一批去操场上玩耍的，也是到时间第一批回来上课的。努力地学习让他享受到玩耍的乐趣，而玩耍也是他努力学习的调剂，因此他课上课下都很快乐。辅导员自然很喜欢他，因为他功课总是很好，不给老师找麻烦。

4．当他要进入大学时，辅导员给他写了很好的推荐信。考试时他能够回答出所有的问题。在专科学校就读时，他学习得非常扎实，为大学学习做了充分准备。因此，他感觉在大学里听课轻而易举就能跟上进度，还有很多时间用来阅读有趣的书籍。

5．但他总会先把课程学习好再去做别的事，还会在背诵之前进行复习。当叫他背诵时，他平静而愉快地站来，几乎很少出错。大学教务长对他评价颇高，所有同学都很尊敬他。

6．大学里有个由成绩最好的学生们组成的社团。查尔斯被选为其中的一员。按惯例，每年都会从社团里选出一人进行公开演讲。这个荣誉被授予了查理。他刻苦地学习，阅读了大量书籍，所以他的演讲对所有听众来说都非常有趣。

7．最后，按照惯常的说法，他毕业了，即他完成了大学课程，拿到了学位。所有人都知道他是一名好学生，都敬佩他。他父母和兄弟姐妹都来参加他的毕业典礼，听他演讲。

8．他们感到非常满足，更加喜爱查尔斯了。很多效益好的工作朝他敞开大门，因为查尔斯已经是能力很强的人了，受到普遍的尊重。他是个有能力并且快乐的人，有一个欢乐的家庭，所有认识他的人都很尊敬他。

9．这些就是勤奋的回报。浑浑噩噩地活着只会让人不快乐，但还有人愿意如此生活，这是多么奇怪啊！懒散的人总是一成不变地贫穷着、痛苦着，勤奋的人是快乐而且充满希望的。

10．但可能一些孩子读到这个故事会问：“上帝是否注意到了课堂上的小孩？”他肯定会注意到的。那么，如果你不认真地利用你的时间，那就是最确凿的证据，证明你的心没有和上帝在一起。你来到世界上就要合理利用时间，年轻时要为将来成为有用的人做准备。如果你不去合理地支配你享有的优势，你就是在对造物主犯罪。



读书、工作或健康地游戏，

让你的生活如此度过；

这样你最后可以

说出每天都完成了些什么。

LESSON 41

THE FOUNTAIN

喷　泉


By James Russell Lowell, one of the most noted of American poets; also well known as an essayist and lecturer. He was born at Cambridge, Mass., in 1819, and died there in 1891.

1．Into the sunshine,

Full of the light,

Leaping and flashing,

From morn till night!

2．Into the moonlight,

Whiter than snow,

Waving so flower-like

When the winds blow!

3．Into the starlight,

Rushing in spray,

Happy at midnight,

Happy by day!

4．Ever in motion,

Blithesome(1) and cheery(2),

Still climbing heavenward,

Never aweary(3);

5．Glad of all weathers,

Still seeming best,

Upward or downward,

Motion, thy rest;

6．Full of a nature

Nothing can tame,

Changed every moment,

Ever the same;

7．Ceaseless aspiring(4),

Ceaseless content,

Darkness or sunshine

Thy element(5);

8．Glorious fountain!

Let my heart be

Fresh, changeful, constant(6),

Upward like thee!

LESSON 42

COFFEE

咖　啡


1．The coffee tree is a native of eastern Africa, but it was in Arabia that it first became known to the people of Europe, and until about the year 1700 A. D. that country afforded(1) the entire supply.

2．Then the coffee seeds found their way to Java, by means of some traders, and one of the first plants grown on that island was sent as a present to the governor of the Dutch East India Company, who lived in Holland.

3．It was planted in the Botanical Gardens at Amsterdam, and in a few years seeds taken from it were sent to South America, where the cultivation of coffee has steadily increased, extending to the West Indies, until now the offspring(2) of this one plant produce more coffee than is obtained from all the other plants in the world.

4．The plant is an evergreen, and is from six to twelve feet high, the stem being from ten to fifteen inches in diameter. The lower branches bend down when the tree begins to grow old, and extend themselves into a round form somewhat like an umbrella; and the wood is so pliable(3) that the ends of the largest branches may be bent down to within two or three feet of the earth.

5．The bark is whitish and somewhat rough. A tree is never without leaves, which are at small distances from one another, and on almost opposite sides of a bough. Blossoms and green and ripe fruit may be seen on the same tree at the same time. When the blossom falls off, there grows in its place a small green fruit, which becomes dark red as it ripens.

6．This fruit is not unlike a cherry, and is very good to eat. Under the pulp of this cherry is found the bean or berry we call coffee, wrapped in a fine, thin skin. The berry is at first very soft, and has a bad taste; but as the cherry ripens the berry grows harder, and the dried-up fruit becomes a shell or pod of a deep brown color.



7．The berry is now solid, and its color is a translucent(4) green. Each shell contains two seeds, rounded on one side and flat on the other. The seeds lie with the flat sides together, and, in one highly prized variety, the two seeds grow together, forming one: this is known as the pea berry. When the fruit is so ripe that it can be shaken from the tree, the husks are separated from the berries, and are used, in Arabia, by the natives, while the berries are sold.

8．The young plants are inserted in holes from twelve to eighteen inches deep, and six or eight feet apart. If left to themselves, they would grow to the height of eighteen or twenty feet; but they are usually dwarfed by pruning(5), so that the fruit may be easily got at by the gatherer.

9．Thus dwarfed, they extend their branches until they cover the whole space about them. They begin to yield fruit the third year. By the sixth or seventh year they are at full bearing, and continue to bear for twenty years or more.

10. Before the berry can be used, it undergoes a process of roasting. The amount of aromatic(6) oil brought out in roasting has much to do with the market value of coffee, and it has been found that the longer the raw coffee is kept, the richer it becomes in this peculiar oil, and so the more valuable. But after the coffee is roasted, and especially after it is ground, it loses its aroma rapidly.

11．Arabia produces the celebrated Mocha, or "Mokha," coffee, which is the finest in the world; but little or none of the best product is ever taken out of that country. The Java coffee from the East Indies is next prized, but the best quality of this kind is also quite difficult to obtain, and many, therefore, prefer the finest grades of Rio coffee from South America to such Mocha and Java as can be had in our country.



EXERCISES.—What country first supplied coffee? How did the plant come to be grown in other countries? Describe the plant. What is said of the fruit? How are the plants cultivated? What is said about the roasting of coffee? What are the three principal kinds of coffee used, and how are they valued?

1．咖啡树原产于非洲东部，但最初是在阿拉伯为欧洲人所知，且直到约公元1700年，阿拉伯地区才开始全面种植咖啡。

2．然后，咖啡种子借助贸易商的传播到达了爪哇岛。岛上的第一株咖啡树当做礼物送给了居住在荷兰的东印度公司总督。

3．人们将咖啡树种植在了阿姆斯特丹的植物园里，又过了些年，它的种子被带到了南美洲。咖啡的种植在那里得到了稳步增长，甚至延伸到了西印度群岛。直到现在，这一株咖啡树出产的咖啡豆比世界上任何咖啡树都多。

4．咖啡树是常绿植物，有6～12英尺高，树干直径有10～12英尺宽。当树开始慢慢变老，靠下的树枝会垂到地上，自己扩展成圆形，看起来像伞状。它的木质非常柔软，最大的树枝顶端可能会垂到距地面2～3英尺的地方。

5．它的树皮微微发白，略显粗糙。树都要有叶子，咖啡树的每片叶子之间距离很小，分布在树枝两侧。在同一棵树上可以同时看到花、未成熟的果实和成熟的果实。当花开败之后，原来的地方会长出一个青绿的果实，等到成熟之后慢慢变成深红色。

6．它的果实和樱桃没什么不同，吃起来味道很不错。这个“樱桃”的紫色下面就是我们称之为的咖啡豆，包裹在一层很细薄的外皮里。咖啡豆最初非常柔软，味道不佳。但随着“樱桃”的成熟，咖啡豆会变硬，干瘪的果实成了一个深棕色的外壳或豆荚。

7．咖啡豆现在是实心的，颜色呈现出半透明的绿色。每个外壳里包含两粒种子，一边是圆弧形，另一边是平直的。两粒种子的平面挨在一起，在一种珍贵的品种中，两粒种子长在一起，合二为一，被称为圆豆。当果实成熟可以从树上摇下来的时候，豆荚从咖啡豆上分离开。在阿拉伯，人们将其利用起来，所以会出售豆荚。

8．小树被插在12～18英尺深的洞里，每棵之间留出6～8英尺的距离。如果让它们自己生长，可以长到18～20英尺高。但人们通常会把它们剪得比较矮，以方便采摘者的工作。

9．由于树变矮了，它们会不断延伸自己的枝干，直到把周围的空间全部覆盖上。到第三年，就开始结果了。到第六或第七年，它们已经硕果累累，并且一直到二十年甚至更长时间都可以结出果实。

10．在使用咖啡豆之前，需要经过一个烘焙的过程，这个过程中带出的芳香油的数量直接关系着咖啡的市场价值。研究发现，原始咖啡保存的时间越长，这种特殊的油分会越丰富，价值自然也会更高。但在咖啡经过烘焙后，尤其是经过研磨后，芳香会迅速消失。

11．阿拉伯出产著名的摩卡，又称穆哈咖啡，是世界上最优质的咖啡。但是上好的产品很少或几乎没有运到国外。东印度群岛的爪哇咖啡紧随其后，但好品质的产品同样很难得到。因此，很多人更愿意选择上等的南美里约咖啡，而不选择美国国内能买到的摩卡或爪哇咖啡。

LESSON 43

THE WINTER KING

冬天之王


1．Oh! what will become of thee, poor little bird?

The muttering(1) storm in the distance is heard;

The rough winds are waking, the clouds growing black,

They'll soon scatter snowflakes all over thy back!

From what sunny clime hast thou wandered away?

And what art thou doing this cold winter day?

2．"I'm picking the gum from the old peach tree;

The storm doesn't trouble me. Pee, dee, dee!"

3．But what makes thee seem so unconscious(2) of care?

The brown earth is frozen, the branches are bare:

And how canst thou be so light-hearted and free,

As if danger and suffering thou never should'st see,

When no place is near for thy evening nest,

No leaf for thy screen, for thy bosom no rest?

4．"Because the same Hand is a shelter for me,

That took off the summer leaves. Pee, dee, dee!"

5．But man feels a burden of care and of grief,

While plucking the cluster(3) and binding the sheaf:

In the summer we faint, in the winter we're chilled,

With ever a void that is yet to be filled.

We take from the ocean, the earth, and the air,

Yet all their rich gifts do not silence our care.

6．"A very small portion sufficient will be,

If sweetened with gratitude. Pee, dee, dee!"

7．But soon there'll be ice weighing down the light bough,

On which thou art flitting(4) so playfully now;

And though there's a vesture(5) well fitted and warm,

Protecting the rest of thy delicate form,

What, then, wilt thou do with thy little bare feet,

To save them from pain, mid the frost and the sleet?

8．"I can draw them right up in my feathers, you see,

To warm them, and fly away. Pee, dee, dee!"

9．I thank thee, bright monitor(6); what thou hast taught

Will oft be the theme of the happiest thought;

We look at the clouds; while the birds have an eye

To Him who reigns over them, changeless and high.

And now little hero, just tell me thy name,

That I may be sure whence my oracle(7) came.

10．"Because, in all weather, I'm merry and free,

They call me the Winter King. Pee, dee, dee!"

1．哦！你会变成什么，可怜的小鸟？

已经听到了远处暴风雪低沉的声音；

狂风已经醒来，云已经越来越黑，

它们很快就会将雪片洒在你的背上！

你是从哪片阳光明媚的土地上悄悄溜走的？

这样寒冷的冬天你怎么度过？

2．“我正从老桃树上取树胶；

风暴不会打扰我。”

3．但是什么使你对关心毫无察觉？

棕色的土地已经结冰，树枝已经光秃；

你如何能如此无忧无虑，自由自在？

仿佛你永远看不到危险和痛苦，

当没有地方能够做你夜晚栖息的巢穴，

没有树叶为你遮挡，没有地方安放你的胸膛呢？

4．“因为同样的手在保护我，

也是它拿走了夏天的树叶。”

5．但是人们感觉到关心和悲伤的负担，

当拔掉一丛，捆起一束时，

我们在夏天里热晕，在冬天里颤抖，

有个空间等待被填满。

我们从海洋、土地和空气中汲取，

但它们所有的礼物都不能使我们的关怀安静下来。

6．“非常小的一部分就足够了，

如果感恩使人愉快。”

7.但是很快冰雪就会压断幼嫩的树枝，

就是你正站在上面跳来跳去自在嬉戏的这枝；

尽管它被很好地覆盖住了，暖暖和和的，

保护了你娇弱的身躯，

那么，你裸露在外的小脚该怎么办，

怎样不在风霜中冻疼它们？

8．“你看，我可以把它们抬起来藏在羽毛里，

暖着它们，飞起来。”

9．感谢你，明智的监督员；你教的东西

将是最快乐思想的主题；

我们看到乌云；而鸟儿的眼睛

一成不变地，高高地着眼于统治着它们的他，

现在，我们的小英雄，告诉我你的名字，

这样我能够确信我的神谕来自何处。

10．“因为在任何天气里，我都快乐而自由，

它们叫我‘冬天之王’。”

LESSON 44

THE NETTLE

荨　麻


1．Anna. O papa! I have stung my hand with that nettle.

2．Father. Well, my dear, I am sorry for it; but pull up that large dock leaf you see near it; now bruise the juice out of it on the part which is stung. Well, is the pain lessened?

3．A. Oh, very much indeed, I hardly feel it now. But I wish there was not a nettle in the world. I am sure I do not know what use there can be in them.

4．F. If you knew anything of botany, Nanny, you would not say so.

5．A. What is botany, papa?

6．F. Botany, my dear, is the knowledge of plants.

7．A. Some plants are very beautiful. If the lily were growing in our fields, I should not complain. But this ugly nettle! I do not know what beauty or use there can be in that.

8．F. And yet, Nanny, there is more beauty, use, and instruction in a nettle, than even in a lily.

9．A. O papa, how can you make that out?

10．F. Put on your gloves, pluck up that nettle, and let us examine it. First, look at the flower.

11．A. The flower, papa? I see no flower, unless those little ragged knobs are flowers, which have neither color nor smell, and are not much larger than the heads of pins.

12．F. Here, take this magnifying glass(1) and examine them.

13．A. Oh, I see now; every little knob is folded up in leaves, like a rosebud. Perhaps there is a flower inside.

14．F. Try; take this pin and touch the knob. Well, what do you see?

15．A. Oh, how curious!

16．F. What is curious?

17．A. The moment I touched it, it flew open. A little cloud rose out like enchantment(2), and four beautiful little stems sprung up as if they were alive; and, now that I look again with the glass, I see an elegant little flower as nice and perfect as a lily itself.

18．F. Well, now examine the leaves.

19．A. Oh, I see they are all covered over with little bristles; and when I examine them with the glass, I see a little bag, filled with a juice like water, at the bottom of each. Ha! these are the things which stung me.

20．F. Now touch the little bag with the point of the pin.

21．A. When I press the bag, the juice runs up and comes out at the small point at the top; so I suppose the little thorn must be hollow inside, though it is finer than the point of my cambric needle.

22．F. Have all the leaves those stings?

23．A. No, papa; some of the young ones are quite green and soft, like velvet, and I may handle them without any danger.

24．F. Now look at the stem, and break it.

25．A. I can easily crack it, but I can not break it asunder(3), for the bark is so strong that it holds it together.

26．F. Well, now you see there are more curious things in the nettle than you expected.

27．A. Yes, indeed, I see that. But you have often told me that God makes nothing without its use; and I am sure I can not see any use in all these things.

28．F. That we will now consider. You saw the little flower burst open, and a cloud rose, you say, like enchantment. Now all this is necessary for the nature of the plant. There are many thousand plants in the world, and it has pleased God, in his wisdom, to make them all different. Now look at this other nettle, which grew on the opposite side of the road; you see that it is not exactly like the one you have just examined.

29．A. No, papa; this has little flat seeds instead of flowers.

30．F. Very right, my dear. Now, in order to make those seeds grow, it is necessary that the little flower of this plant and the seed of that should be together, as they are in most others. But plants can not walk, like animals. The wisdom of God, therefore, has provided a remedy(4) for this. When the little flower bursts open it throws out a fine powder, which you saw rise like a cloud; this is conveyed(5) by the air to the other plant, and when it falls upon the seed of that plant it gives it power to grow, and makes it a perfect seed, which, in its turn, when it falls to the ground, will produce a new plant. Were it not for this fine powder, that seed would never be perfect or complete.

31．A. That is very curious, indeed; and I see the use of the little cloud and the flower; but the leaf that stung me, of what use can that be? There, dear papa, I am afraid I puzzle you to tell me that.

32．F. Even these stings are made useful to man. The poor people in some countries use them instead of blisters, when they are sick. Those leaves which do not sting are used by some for food, and from the stalk others get a stringy(6) bark, which answers the purpose of flax. Thus you see that even the despised nettle is not made in vain; and this lesson may serve to teach you that we only need to understand the works of God to see that "in goodness and wisdom he has made them all."

1．安娜：哦！爸爸！那棵荨麻蜇到了我的手。

2．父亲：亲爱的，我为你感到难过；拔下一片旁边的大酸模叶，挤出叶子上的汁，涂在蜇疼了的地方。恩，现在不那么疼了吧？

3．安娜：哦，确实是，我几乎感觉不到疼了。但我真希望世界上没有荨麻。我不知道它们能有什么用处。

4．父亲：娜娜，如果你了解植物学的话就不会这么说了。

5．安娜：爸爸，什么是植物学?

6．父亲：亲爱的，植物学就是关于植物的学问。

7．安娜：一些植物很漂亮。如果我们的地里长出的是百合花，我就没什么可抱怨的了。但却是这种难看的荨麻！我真不知道它有什么漂亮之处或者能有什么用处。

8．父亲：不是啊，娜娜，荨麻里的妙处、功用和门道可比百合花多多了。

9．安娜：哦，爸爸，你是怎么知道的？

10．父亲：戴上手套，拔下那棵荨麻，让我们一起来对它进行个考察。首先，看看它的花。

11．安娜：爸爸，它的花？我看不到花，除非说那些粗糙的小疙瘩是花。它们即没颜色又没味道，还没有大头针的头大呢。

12．父亲：这里，拿着这个放大镜观察它们。

13．安娜：噢，我现在看到了；每个小疙瘩都藏在叶子里，像个玫瑰花苞。也许里面有朵花。

14．父亲：试试，用这个大头针碰碰那个疙瘩。你看见什么了？

15．安娜：哦，真奇怪！

16．父亲：什么奇怪啊？

17．安娜：我碰到它的一瞬间，它就打开了，像施了魔法。一朵云雾玫瑰般的小花长了出来，四条小小的枝茎仿佛有生命一般涌了出来。现在我再用放大镜看，能看见一朵像百合花一样漂亮而优雅的小花了。

18．父亲：很好，现在再看看叶子。

19．安娜：哦，我看见叶子上面都覆盖着一层很细小的硬毛。当我用放大镜看时，能看到每根硬毛的下面都有一个小囊袋，里面充满着像水一样的汁液。哈！这些就是蜇我的东西。

20．父亲：现在，用大头针的头碰碰那个小囊袋。

21．安娜：当我按压它时，里面的汁液挤了上来，从顶部的小孔处流出来。所以我估计那个小刺里面应该是空的，尽管它比我的麻纱针的针头锋利多了。

22．父亲：所有的叶子上都有这些刺吗？

23．安娜：不是的，爸爸。一些嫩刺还很绿很软，像天鹅绒，我处理它们一点都没危险。

24．父亲：现在看看枝干，把它折断。

25．安娜：我很容易就把它弄折了，但没法让它断开，因为外皮太坚韧了，总连在一起。

26．父亲：好了，你看荨麻里奇妙的事情比你想象的多很多吧。

27．安娜：是啊，我看到了。但是您原来经常告诉我说上帝造的每样东西都有它的用处。我可是看不出这些能有什么用。

28．父亲：那是我们现在要来考量的事。你看到了小花的绽开，一片玫瑰色的云雾，你说像有魔力一样。所有这些都是植物自然生长所必需的。世界上有成千上万种植物，上帝以他的智慧欣然将它们创作成各自不同的样子。现在你看看长在马路对面的另一种荨麻，和你刚才仔细检查过的不完全一样。

29．安娜：是的，爸爸。这种长着扁平的种子，而不是花。

30．父亲：没错，亲爱的。为了让这些种子生长，必须把这株植物的小花和种子凑到一起，就像大多数情况下那样。但植物不能像动物一样行走移动。因此，上帝的智慧为之提供了一个补救的办法。小花绽开时会抛出一些花粉，就是你看到的像云团一样的东西，它通过空气被运送到其他植物上。当落到那个植物的种子上时，它就让花粉在里面生长，使其成为一个饱满的种子。反过来，等到种子落到地上，就会长出一株新的植物。要不是有了这种花粉，种子将无法变得饱满和完整。

31．安娜：确实很奇特。我知道小云团和花的用处了。但是那蜇我的叶子呢，它能有什么用？亲爱的爸爸，让你告诉我这个，恐怕把你弄糊涂了。

32．父亲：这些刺对人类也是有用的。在一些国家，穷人们生病时不用药，而是用它们来治病。这些不带刺的叶子可以用做食物原料，人们还从它的茎上得到纤维质的茎皮，来制作亚麻。这样一来，你看，连最不起眼的荨麻都不是一无是处的。这一课可以教育你，我们需要去理解上帝的杰作，看“他是如何用善意和智慧创造了这一切”。

LESSON 45

THE TEMPEST

暴风雨


By James T. Fields (born 1817, died 1881), who was born at Portsmouth, N. H. He was a poet, and the author, also, of some well known prose works. Of these, his "Yesterdays with Authors" is the most noted.

1．We were crowded in the cabin;

Not a soul would dare to sleep:

It was midnight on the waters,

And a storm was on the deep(1).

2．'T is a fearful thing in winter

To be shattered by the blast(2),

And to hear the rattling trumpet

Thunder, "Cut away the mast!"

3．So we shuddered there in silence,

For the stoutest held his breath,

While the hungry sea was roaring,

And the breakers(3) threatened death.

4．And as thus we sat in darkness,

Each one busy in his prayers,

"We are lost!" the captain shouted,

As he staggered down the stairs.

5．But his little daughter whispered,

As she took his icy hand,

"Is n't God upon the ocean,

Just the same as on the land?”

6．Then we kissed the little maiden,

And we spoke in better cheer(4);

And we anchored safe in harbor

When the morn was shining clear.

1．我们挤在船舱里，

没有一个人敢睡去，

那是海上的午夜，

海上风暴正起。

2．这是冬天最可怕的事，

被一阵疾风打碎，

听到绳梯的吼叫声

雷声，“切断桅杆！”

3．我们在沉默中战栗，

连最强壮的人都屏住了呼吸，

当饥饿的大海在咆哮时，

浪花发出死亡的威胁。

4．这样一来，我们坐在黑暗中，

每个人都忙着祈祷，

“我们迷路了！”船长喊道，

从楼梯上跌跌撞撞地跑下来。

5．但他的小女儿握起他冰冷的手轻声说，

“难道上帝不是像在陆地上一样，

也会在海上吗？”

6．我们亲了亲小女孩，

用更加欢快的语调谈话；

我们在早晨明媚的阳光里，

平安地停靠在港口。

LESSON 46

THE CREATOR

造物主


The poetry at the close of this selection is by John Keble, a celebrated English clergyman, born in 1792. He held for some years the professorship of Poetry at Oxford University. He died in 1866.



1．Come, and I will show you what is beautiful. It is a rose fully blown(1). See how she sits upon her mossy stem, the queen of flowers. Her leaves glow like fire. The air is filled with her sweet odor(2). She is the delight of every eye.

2．But there is one fairer than the rose. He that made the rose is more beautiful than the rose. He is altogether lovely. He is the delight of every heart.

3．I will show you what is strong. The lion is strong. When he raiseth himself up from his lair(3), when he shaketh his mane, when the voice of his roaring is heard, the cattle of the field fly, and the wild beasts of the desert(4)hide themselves; for he is terrible.

4．But He who made the lion is stronger than the lion. He can do all things. He gave us life, and in a moment can take it away, and no one can save us from his hand.

5．I will show you what is glorious. The sun is glorious. When he shineth in the clear sky, when he sitteth on his throne in the heavens, and looketh abroad over the earth, he is the most glorious and excellent(5) object the eye can behold.

6．But He who made the sun is more glorious than the sun. The eye cannot look on his dazzling(6) brightness. He seeth all dark places, by night as well as by day. The light of his countenance is over all the world.

7．This great Being is God. He made all things, but He is more excellent than all that He has made. He is the Creator, they are the creatures. They may be beautiful, but He is Beauty. They may be strong, but He is Strength. They may be perfect, but He is Perfection(7).

8．There is a book, who runs may read,

Which heavenly truth imparts(8),

And all the lore(9) its scholars need—

Pure eyes and loving hearts.

9．The works of God, above, below,

Within us, and around,

Are pages in that book, to show

How God himself is found.

10．The glorious sky, embracing all,

Is like the Father's love;

Wherewith encompassed(10), great and small

In peace and order move.

11．Thou who hast given me eyes to see

And love this sight so fair,

Give me a heart to find out Thee

And read Thee everywhere.



EXERCISES.—What is described as beautiful? As strong? As glorious? Who is more beautiful than the rose, stronger than the lion, and more glorious than the sun? What is the book which we may all read? What should it teach us?

本部分结尾处的诗歌由约翰·基布尔创作。他生于1792年，是一位著名的英国牧师。他曾多年受聘为牛津大学的诗歌教授，于1866年逝世。

1．来吧，我来告诉你们漂亮是什么。是完全绽开的玫瑰花。看花中女王是如何安坐在长着青苔的枝干上，她的叶子如火般闪光，空气中充满着她香甜的气息。她是每个人眼中欣喜的源泉。

2．但还有比玫瑰更美丽的，创造出玫瑰的人比玫瑰还要美丽，他还是可爱的，是每个人心中欣喜的源泉。

3．我来告诉你们强壮是什么。狮子是强壮的。当他从藏身之处起身，当他摇动鬃毛，当听到他的吼声，野外的牛儿飞奔，荒原上的野兽躲藏起来，因为他很可怕。

4．但是创造了狮子的人比狮子更强壮，他能做所有的事情。他给了我们生命，也可以在瞬间将它夺走，没有人能从他手里救出我们。

5．我来告诉你什么是灿烂的。太阳是灿烂的。当他在晴朗的天空闪耀，当他坐在天空的宝座上，看向地球时，他是肉眼能看到的最灿烂、最杰出的物体。

6．但是创造了太阳的人比太阳还要灿烂。眼睛无法注视他那耀眼的光亮。他看到了所有黑暗的地方，无论在黑夜还是白天。他脸上的光辉洒遍全世界。

7．这个伟大的存在就是上帝。他创造了这一切，但他比创作出的一切都要杰出。他是造物主，他们是创造出的产物。他们可能漂亮，但他才是美。他们可能强壮，但他是力量。他们可能完美，但他是完满。

8．有一本书，人人能读，

传授神圣的真理，

和学者需要的一切知识——

纯净的眼神和爱心。

9．上帝的作品，上面，下面，

我们心里，我们周围，

那本书里是否写了，

上帝是怎么发现自己。

10．耀眼的天空，拥抱一切，

像上帝的爱；

用什么来包围住，使大大小小

和平而有序地运动着。

11．你给了我看四周的眼睛，

我当然地爱上了这景象，

你赋予我心灵去找寻你，

我在任何地方都能读到你。

LESSON 47

THE HORSE

马


1．Uncle Thomas. Well, boys, I am glad to see you again. Since I last saw you I have made quite a tour, and at some future time will describe to you what I have seen. I promised at this meeting, however, to tell you something about animals, and I propose to begin with the horse. But I know that you like stories better than lecturing, so I will proceed at once to tell you some which I have gathered for you.



2．Frank. We never feel tired of listening to you, Uncle Thomas. We know you always have something curious to tell us.

3．Uncle Thomas. Well then, Frank, to begin at once with the horse.

4．In several parts of the world there are to be found large herds of wild horses. In South America the immense(1) plains are inhabited(2) by them, and it is said that ten thousand are sometimes found in a single herd. These herds are always preceded by a leader, who directs their motions; and such

is the regularity with which they perform their movements, that it seems as if they could hardly be surpassed by the best trained cavalry(3).

5．It is extremely dangerous for travelers to meet a herd of this description. When they are unaccustomed to the sight of such a mass of creatures, they can not help feeling greatly alarmed at their rapid and apparently irresistible approach. The trampling of the animals sounds like distant thunder; and such is the rapidity and impetuosity(4) of their advance, that it seems to threaten instant destruction.

6．Sometimes, however, they suddenly stop short, utter a loud and piercing neigh, and, with a rapid wheel, take an opposite course, and altogether disappear. On such occasions it requires great care in the traveler to prevent his horses from breaking loose and escaping with the wild herd.

7．In those countries where wild horses are so plentiful, the inhabitants do not take the trouble to raise others, but whenever they want one they mount upon an animal accustomed to the sport, and gallop over the plain toward a herd, which is readily found at no great distance.

8．The rider gradually approaches some stragglers from the main body, and, having selected the one he wishes, he dexterously(5) throws the lasso (which is a long rope with a running noose, and is firmly fixed to his saddle) either over the wild horse's head or in such a manner as to entangle his hind legs; and by the sudden checking of his own horse, he throws the captured animal over on its side.

9．In an instant he jumps off his horse, wraps his cloak round the head of the captive, forces a bit into his mouth, and straps a saddle on his back. He then removes the cloak, and the animal starts to his feet. With equal quickness the hunter leaps into his saddle; and, in spite of the kicking of the captive, keeps his seat, till, being wearied out with his efforts, the horse submits to the guidance of his new master, and is reduced(6) to complete obedience.

10．Frank. But, Uncle Thomas, are all horses originally(7) wild? I have heard that Arabia is famous for raising horses.

11．Uncle Thomas. Arabia has, for a long time, been noted for the beauty and speed of its horses. It is not strange, however, that the Arabian horse should be the most excellent, when we consider the care and kindness with which it is treated. One of the best stories which I have ever heard of the love of an Arabian for his steed, is that related of an Arab, from whom an English officer wished to purchase his horse.

12．The animal was a bright bay mare, of fine form and great beauty; and the owner, proud of her appearance and qualities, paraded(8) her before the Englishman's tent until she attracted his attention. On being asked if he would sell her, "What will you give me?" was the reply. "That depends upon her age. I suppose she is past five?" "Guess again," said he. "Four?”"Look at her mouth," said the Arab, with a smile. On examination she was found to be about three. This, from her size and symmetry(9), greatly increased her value.

13．The gentleman said, "I will give you eighty tomans(10)," (nearly two hundred and fifty dollars). "A little more, if you please," said the fellow, somewhat entertained. "Ninety—a hundred." He shook his head and smiled. The officer at last came to three hundred tomans, (nearly one thousand dollars). "Well," said the Arab, "you need not tempt me further. You are a rich nobleman, and, I am told, have loads of silver and gold. Now," added he, "you want my mare, but you shall not have her for all you have got." He put spurs to his horse, and was soon out of the reach of temptation.

14．The horse can swim, when necessary, as well as most other animals, although he is not very fond of the water. Some years ago a vessel was driven upon the rocks, on the coast of the Cape of Good Hope, and most of the crew fell an immediate sacrifice to the waves. Those who were left were seen from the shore, clinging to the different pieces of the wreck. The sea ran so high that no boat could venture off to their assistance.

15．Meanwhile, a planter had come from his farm to be a spectator of the shipwreck. His heart was melted at the sight of the unhappy seamen, and, knowing the bold spirit of his horse and his excellence as a swimmer, he determined to make a desperate(11) effort for their deliverance(12). Having blown a little Brandy into his horse's nostrils, he pushed into the midst of the breakers. At first both horse and rider disappeared, but it was not long before they floated to the surface, and swam up to the wreck; when, taking two men with him, each of whom held on by one of his boots, the planter brought them safe to shore.

16．This was repeated no less than seven times, and he saved fourteen lives; but on his return the eighth time, being much fatigued, and meeting a tremendous wave, he lost his balance and sank in a moment. His horse swam safely to land, but its gallant(13) rider sank, to rise no more.



EXERCISES.—Where are wild horses found? How are they taken? For what purpose are they taken? In what country are the finest horses raised? Why are the horses so excellent there? Are not animals always made better by kind treatment? Why would not the Arab sell his horse? Relate the anecdote of the planter and the shipwrecked seamen.

1．托马斯叔叔：啊，孩子们，很高兴再次见到大家。自从上次见到你们之后，我去旅游了一段时间，将来给你们讲讲我看到了些什么。不管怎么说，我答应过这次见面会给你们讲关于动物的事，我建议从马开始讲起。我知道你们喜欢听故事，不喜欢听课，所以我马上来给你们讲讲搜集到的故事。

2．弗兰克：托马斯叔叔，听您讲故事我们从来不感到疲倦。我们知道您总会讲些奇特的事情。

3．托马斯叔叔：好吧，弗兰克，这就开始讲马的故事了。

4．在世界上很多地方都发现了大群的野马。它们有些生活在南美洲广袤的平原上，据说有时一个马群就有1万匹之多。马群都由一个领头的马带队，它来指挥大家的行动。这就是马匹们行动的秩序性，看起来经过最优秀培训的骑兵也很难能超越它们。

5．对旅行者来说，遇到这样的一群马匹是非常危险的。当他们还不习惯于眼前这么一大群的生物时，会不禁被它们快速且显然不可抗拒的行动方式吓住。动物们发出的踢踏声听起来像远处的雷声，那是它们飞快且疾速前进的声音，似乎带来了瞬间毁灭的威胁。

6．但有的时候，它们会突然间停下来，发出高亢而尖利的嘶叫声，然后迅速转弯，朝着对面跑去，全部消失不见。在这种情形下，旅游者需要特别小心，防止他自己的马挣脱缰绳随着野马群一起跑掉。

7．在那些野马数量很多的国家，居民们不必费力去饲养它们。但当他们需要一匹马时，会骑上一匹善于奔跑的马，朝着平原上不远处就能找到的马群奔去。

8．骑马的人渐渐地接近从大群里掉队的马匹，选择一匹他想要的，灵活地抛出索套（一条长绳子，一端系个套，另一端牢牢地绑在他的鞍上），或者套住野马的头，或者缠住它的后腿。然后突然停住自己的马，把捕到的马拉向一边。

9．随后，他快速跳下马，用斗篷遮在被捕马匹的头上，给它喂些吃的，在它背上套上马鞍。然后他移开斗篷，马匹就会开始走起来。猎人同时非常迅速地跳上这匹马，尽管被捕到的马匹会不停地踢来踢去，但只要一直保持骑在马上，直到马匹用尽力气，它就会听从新主人的指挥，变得完全顺从。

10．托弗兰克：马斯叔叔，所有的马原来都是野马吗？我听说阿拉伯人驯马非常有名。

11．托马斯叔叔：很长一段时间，阿拉伯国家以其马匹的健美和速度而闻名于世。我们想想那里的马得到的照料和关怀，就不会对阿拉伯马是最出色的而感到奇怪了。关于阿拉伯人热爱自己的马，我听说过的最好的故事是一名英国军官想从一个阿拉伯人那里买他的马。

12．那匹马是一匹亮红棕色的母马，体格健硕，俊美无比。马的主人为它的外表和体格感到骄傲，骑着它在英国人的帐篷外炫耀，直到引起了英国人的注意。当被问及愿不愿意将它出售时，主人回答：“你能给我什么？”“那要看它的年龄。我猜它已经超过五岁了？”“再猜，”他说。“四岁？”“看看它的嘴，”阿拉伯人笑着说。经过检查，发现它大约三岁的样子。从它的体型大小和体格匀称程度来看，这样的年龄无疑大大增加了它的价值。

13．绅士说：“我给你80托曼金币（约合250美元）。”“请再加点吧，”阿拉伯人有点恳切地说。“90～100。”他还是微笑着摇摇头。最后，英国军官给到了300托曼金币（约合1000美元）。“好吧，”阿拉伯人说，“您不要再诱惑我了。我听说您是个有钱的贵族，有成堆的金银财宝。现在，”他补充说，“您想要我的马，但又不愿意用您所有的钱去换它。”说完，他将马鞭放在马上，很快离开了这个充满诱惑的地方。

14．虽然马不太喜欢水，但当情况需要时，马也能像其他动物一样游泳。几年前，一艘船在好望角的岸边撞到了礁石上，大部分船员很快成了海浪的牺牲品。从岸上看去，活下来的那些人都抓着船体残骸。海浪非常高，没有船敢冒险出海去营救他们。

15．就在这时，一个庄稼汉从农场走来，看到了船只遇险。海员们遇难的景象顿时融化了他的心，他知道自己的马非常勇敢，而他自己也是名游泳高手，于是决定不顾一切去营救船员们。他先往马的鼻孔里擦了些白兰地，然后牵着马儿冲进了浪花里。刚一进到海里，马和骑手都消失了，但不久他们就浮出了水面，朝着船的残骸游了过去。他让两名船员每个人都抓住他的一只靴子，然后安全地将他们带回了岸边。

16．这样重复了至少七次，救回了14条生命。但当他第八次返回时，由于太过疲惫，又加上遇到巨浪，他的身体失去了平衡，顷刻间沉了下去。他的马安全地回到陆上，可它勇敢的主人却沉到了水里，再也没有起来。

LESSON 48

EMULATION(1)

竞　争


1．Frank's father was speaking to a friend, one day, on the subject of competition(2) at school. He said that he could answer for it that envy is not always connected with it.

2．He had been excelled(3) by many, but did not recollect ever having felt envious of his successful rivals(4); "nor did my winning many a prize from my friend Birch," said he, "ever lessen his friendship for me."

3．In support of the truth of this, a friend who was present related an anecdote(5) which had fallen under his own notice in a school in his neighborhood.

4．At this school the sons of several wealthy farmers, and others, who were poorer, received instruction. Frank listened with great attention while the gentleman gave the following account of the two rivals:

5．It happened that the son of a rich farmer and the son of a poor widow came in competition for the head of their class. They were so nearly equal that the teacher could scarcely decide between them; some days one, and some days the other, gained the head of the class. It was determined by seeing who should be at the head of the class for the greater number of days in the week.

6．The widow's son, by the last day's trial, gained the victory, and kept his place the following week, till the school was dismissed for the holidays.

7．When they met again the widow's son did not appear, and the farmer's son, being next to him, might now have been at the head of his class. Instead of seizing the vacant place, however, he went to the widow's house to inquire what could be the cause of her son's absence.

8．Poverty was the cause; the poor woman found that she was not able, with her utmost efforts, to continue to pay for the tuition(6) and books of her son, and so he, poor fellow! had been compelled to give up his schooling, and to return to labor for her support.

9．The farmer's son, out of the allowance of pocket money which his father gave him, bought all the necessary books and paid for the tuition of his rival. He also permitted him to be brought back again to the head of his class, where he continued for some time, at the expense of his generous rival.



EXERCISES.—What is the subject of this lesson? What do you mean by emulation? What is envy? What story is told about the two rivals? Is it right to envy any person?

1．一天，弗兰克的爸爸正在和一个朋友聊天，内容是关于校园内竞争的。他说自己敢负责任地说，嫉妒并不总是和竞争联系在一起。

2．很多人都比他优秀，但他不记得自己曾经嫉妒过对手的成功。“我从朋友波驰那里赢过很多奖，”他说，“但这丝毫没有削弱他和我的友谊。”

3．为支持这种说法的真实性，在场的一位朋友讲述了他注意到的一个故事，就发生他家社区的学校里。

4．在这所学校里，一些富农的孩子和贫农的孩子一起上课接受教育。弗兰克全神贯注地听着，这位绅士讲述了以下关于两名竞争对手的故事。

5．一个富农的儿子和一个穷寡妇的儿子在班里竞争当班长。他们两人的成绩不分伯仲，老师也没法决定让谁来当。有些时候其中一个人的成绩是班上最好的，过些天另外一个人的成绩又是最好的。最后决定，谁在一周里成绩好的时间长就由谁来当班长。

6．在最后一天的角逐中，寡妇的儿子获得了胜利，并将优势保持到了接下来的一周，直到学校假期的来临。

7．当开学后再见面时，寡妇的儿子没有出现。富农的儿子因为成绩紧随其后，可以成为班上的班长了。但是，他并没有抢占这个空位置，而是去寡妇的家里询问是什么原因使得她儿子上课缺席。

8．原因是贫穷。可怜的女人发现她尽了最大努力也没办法继续支付儿子的学费和书本费了，可怜的家伙！所以他不得不被迫辍学，回到家里帮妈妈干活。

9．富农的儿子拿出父亲给他的零用钱，给他的对手买齐了所需的课本，交齐了学费，还允许他再次做回班长的位置。寡妇的儿子继续做着班长，而学费却是慷慨的对手提供的。

LESSON 49

THE SANDPIPER

矶　鹞


1．Across the lonely beach we flit,

One little sandpiper(1) and I,

And fast I gather, bit by bit,

The scattered driftwood(2), bleached(3) and dry.

The wild waves reach their hands for it,

The wild wind raves, the tide(4) runs high,

As up and down the beach we flit,

One little sandpiper and I.

2．Above our heads the sullen clouds

Scud(5), black and swift, across the sky;

Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds(6)

Stand out the white lighthouses high.

Almost as far as eye can reach

I see the close-reefed(7) vessels fly,

As fast we flit across the beach,

One little sandpiper and I.

3．I watch him as he skims along,

Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;

He starts not at my fitful(8) song,

Nor flash of fluttering drapery(9).

He has no thought of any wrong,

He scans(10) me with a fearless eye;

Stanch(11) friends are we, well-tried and strong,

The little sandpiper and I.

4．Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,

When the loosed storm breaks furiously?

My driftwood fire will burn so bright!

To what warm shelter canst thou fly?

I do not fear for thee, though wroth(12)

The tempest rushes through the sky;

For are we not God's children both,

Thou, little sandpiper, and I?



(Cella Thaxter)

1．我们掠过寂寞的海滩，

我和一只小矶鹞，

我快速地捡拾着，一点一点，

散落的浮木，发白而干枯。

狂浪伸出手要抓它，

我们在海滩来来回回地走，

一只小矶鹞和我。

2．我们头顶是阴郁的云，

阴暗而迅速的，划过天空；

像沉默的幽灵在朦胧的雾色中

高高的白色灯塔凸现出来。

几乎在眼睛能看到的地方

我看到收起了帆的船儿在飞，

像我们掠过海滩一样迅速，

一只小矶鹞和我。

3．我看着它跳过来，

发出甜美而哀伤的叫声；

它开始唱的不是我断断续续的歌曲，

也不是飘飘帷幕的闪光，

它不知道什么是错，

它用无畏的眼神扫看我；

我们是亲密的朋友，经过考验，依然坚强，

小矶鹞和我。

4．伙伴，你在哪里过夜？

当肆意的风暴狂怒着来到？

我的浮木将会燃烧得很亮！

你能飞到哪个温暖的避风港？

我不为你担心，尽管汹涌的

风暴怒吼着冲向天空，

因为难道我们不是上帝的孩子，

你，小矶鹞，和我？

LESSON 50

THE RIGHT WAY

正确的方式


Adapted from a story by Frank R. Stockton. He was born at Philadelphia, April 5, 1834, and when quite a young boy used to write stories for his own pleasure. He was once a designer and engraver on wood, and afterwards an editor; but he now devotes himself entirely to writing, not only for young but also for grown people.



1．"O Andy!" said little Jenny Murdock, "I'm so glad you came along this way. I can't get over."

2．"Can't get over?" said Andrew. "Why what's the matter?"

3．"The bridge is gone," said Jenny. "When I came across after breakfast it was there, and now it's over on the other side, and how can I get back home?"

4．"Why, so it is," said Andrew. "It was all right when I came over a little while ago, but old Donald pulls it on the other side every morning after he has driven his cows across, and I don't think he has any right to do it. I suppose he thinks the bridge was made for him and his cows."

5．"Now I must go down to the big bridge, Andy, and I want you to go with me. I'm afraid to go through all those dark woods by myself," said Jenny.

6．"But I can't go, Jenny," said Andrew, "it's nearly school time now."

7．Andrew was a Scotch boy, and a fine fellow. He was next to the head of his school, and he was as good at play as he was at his book.

8．Jenny Murdock, his most particular(1) friend, was a little girl who lived very near Andrew's home. She had no brothers or sisters, but Andrew had always been as good as a brother to her; and, therefore, when she stood by the water's edge that morning, just ready to burst into tears, she thought all her troubles over when she saw Andrew coming along the road.

9．He had always helped her out of her troubles before, and she saw no reason why he should not do it now. She had crossed the creek in search of wild flowers, and when she wished to return had found the bridge removed, as Andrew supposed, by old Donald McKensie, who pastured his cows on this side of the creek.

10．This stream was not very wide, nor very deep at its edges, but in the center it was four or five feet deep; and in the spring the water ran very swiftly, so that wading across it, either by cattle or men, was quite a difficult undertaking. As for Jenny, she could not get across at all without abridge, and there was none nearer than the wagon bridge, a mile and a half below.

11．"You will go with me, Andy, won't you?" said the little girl.

12．"And be late to school?" said he. "I have not been late yet, you know, Jenny."

13．"Perhaps Dominie(2) Black will think you have been sick or had to mind the cows," said Jenny.

14．"He won't think so unless I tell him," said Andrew, "and you know I won't do that."

15．"If we were to run all the way, would you be too late?" said Jenny.

16．"If we were to run all the way to the bridge, and I were to run all the way back, I should not get to school till after copy time. I expect every minute to hear the school bell ring," said Andrew.

17．"But what can I do, then?" said poor little Jenny. "I can't wait here till school's out, and I don't want to go up to the schoolhouse, for all the boys to laugh at me."

18．"No," said Andrew, reflecting(3) very seriously, "I must take you home some way or other. It won't do to leave you here, and, no matter where you might stay, your mother would be very much troubled about you."

19．"Yes," said Jenny, "she would think I was drowned."

20．Time pressed, and Jenny's countenance became more and more overcast(4), but Andrew could think of no way in which he could take the little girl home without being late and losing his standing in the school.

21．It was impossible to get her across the stream at any place nearer than the "big bridge;" he would not take her that way, and make up a false story to account(5) for his lateness at school, and he could not leave her alone or take her with him.

22．What was to be done? While several absurd and impracticable(6) plans were passing through his brain, the school bell began to ring, and he must start immediately to reach the schoolhouse in time.

23．And now his anxiety(7) and perplexity became more intense than ever; and Jenny, looking up into his troubled countenance, began to cry.

24．Andrew, who had never before failed to be at the school door before the first tap of the bell, began to despair. Was there nothing to be done?

25．Yes! a happy thought passed through his mind. How strange that he should not have thought of it before! He would ask Dominie Black to let him take Jenny home. What could be more sensible and straightforward than such a plan?

26．Of course, the good old schoolmaster gave Andrew the desired permission, and everything ended happily. But the best thing about the whole affair was the lesson that the young Scotch boy learned that day.

27．The lesson was this: when we are puzzling our brains with plans to help ourselves out of trouble, let us always stop a moment in our planning, and try to think if there is not some simple way out of the difficulty, which shall be in every respect perfectly right. If we do this, we shall probably find a way more easy and satisfactory than any which we can devise(8).



EXERCISES.—Why could not Jenny cross the stream? Whom did she ask to help her? What can you tell about Andrew? Who was Jenny Murdock? What did Jenny wish Andrew to do? Why could he not go with her? Would it have been right for Andrew to have told an untruth even to help Jenny out of trouble? What did he finally do? What does this lesson teach us to do in case of trouble?





【中文阅读】


节选自弗兰克·H·斯托克顿所著的故事。他1843年4月5日生于费城，在少年时就以写作为乐趣。他曾当过木材设计师和雕刻师，还做过编辑。随后全身心投入写作，不仅为儿童编写作品，也为成年人写作。

1．“哦，安迪！”小珍妮· 默多克说，“我真高兴你从这边路过。我过不去了。”

2．“过不来了？”安德鲁说，“怎么回事？”

3．“桥不见了，”珍妮说，“早餐后我过来时桥还在那儿，现在却在另外一边了，我怎么回家呀？”

4．“哎呀，是啊，”安德鲁说，“刚才我从这儿经过的时候还是好好的，可是老唐纳德每天早上赶着他的牛过桥以后就把桥拉到一边去，他根本没权利这么做。我猜他以为这桥是为他和他的牛修建的。”

5．“安迪，现在我必须要到大桥那边去了，我想让你和我一起去。我害怕自己一个人穿过那片黑暗的树林。”珍妮说。

6．“但是我不能去啊，珍妮，”安德鲁说，“上课的时间马上就到了。”

7．安德鲁是个苏格兰男孩，一个好学生。他几乎是学校里的孩子王，又会玩又会学习。

8．珍妮·默多克是他最特别的朋友。这个小女孩住在安德鲁家附近，她没有兄弟姐妹，安德鲁总像哥哥似的照顾她。所以，那天早上，当她站在岸边就快要哭出来时，一看到安德鲁走了过来，她就觉得所有的麻烦都算不了什么了。

9．安德鲁原来总是能帮她摆脱困境，她不明白为什么这次不行。她刚才沿着小溪去找野花，等回来的时候发现桥已经移走了，正如安德鲁猜的，是老唐纳德·麦肯斯干的，他总在小溪这边放牛。

10．面前这条小河并不太宽，河水也不很深，但是河的中央会有四五英尺深。春天时水流得非常湍急，所以涉水过河无论对牛还是人来说都是件很困难的事。对珍妮而言，没有桥她根本过不去，附近最近的公路桥在离这里一里半的下游。

11．“安迪，你会跟我一起去吧？”小女孩问道。

12．“然后上课迟到？”他说，“知道么，珍妮，我还从没迟到过。”

13．“也许布莱克校长会认为你生病了，或者需要照顾牛。”珍妮说。

14．“除非我亲自告诉他，否则他不会那么想的，”安德鲁说，“你知道我不会那么说的。”

15．“如果我们一直快点跑着，你还会迟到吗？”珍妮问。

16．“如果我们快速跑到桥那里，我还要再跑回来，抄写课之前我肯定到不了学校。我还想在上课的钟声响起之前到学校呢。”安德鲁说。

17．“但是，那我该怎么办？”可怜的小珍妮说，“我也不能一直在这里等着你下课，我也不想一起去教室，男孩子们会笑话我的。”

18．“是，”安德鲁严肃地思考着说，“我一定得想个办法把你送回家。不能把你留在这里，无论你待在哪儿，你妈妈都会很担心你的。”

19．“是啊，”珍妮说，“她没准认为我被淹死了。”

20．时间越来越紧迫，珍妮的表情也变得越来越忧愁，但是安德鲁还是没有想出办法，既能将小女孩送回家还不至于上课迟到，让他在学校的威信扫地。

21．除了“大桥”那里，没有任何更近的地方可以送她过河；而他又不能去那里送她之后编个故事来解释为什么迟到；他既不能把她留在原地又不能带她去学校。

22．怎么办呢？正当若干个荒唐而不切实际的计划在他脑子里闪过时，学校的钟声开始响起来，他必须开始往教室那边赶了。

23．现在，他的焦虑和困窘比任何时候都更加强烈。珍妮抬起头，看到他发愁的样子，哭了起来。

24．从来都是在第一遍钟声响起前踏进校门的安德鲁现在开始感到绝望了。难道就没有任何办法了吗？

25．是的！一个两全齐美的想法闪过脑海。之前没想到真是太奇怪了！他先去和布莱克校长说明情况，让他带珍妮回家。什么计划能比这个更合理更直接呢？

26．当然，善良的老校长允许了安德鲁这样做，一切得以圆满地解决。但是整个过程中最好的事是那名苏格兰少年学到了一课。

27．这一课是：当我们绞尽脑汁想帮助自己摆脱困境时，让我们停下片刻，试着想想是否还有更简单、从各方面都更完美的脱困办法。如果我们这样做，就可能会找到比原先计划中更简单易行、更令人满意的办法。

LESSON 51

THE GOLDEN RULE

黄金法则


1．To act with integrity(1) and good faith was such a habit with Susan that she had never before thought of examining the Golden Rule: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." But the longer she reflected upon it, the stronger was her conviction(2) that she did not always obey the precept; at length, she appealed(3) to her mother for its meaning.

2．"It implies," said her mother, "in the first place, a total destruction of all selfishness: for a man who loves himself better than his neighbors, can never do to others as he would have others do to him. We are bound not only to do, but to feel, toward others as we would have others feel toward us. Remember, it is much easier to reprove the sin of others than to overcome temptation(4) when it assails(5) ourselves.

3．"A man may be perfectly honest and yet very selfish; but the command implies something more than mere honesty; it requires charity as well as integrity. The meaning of the command is fully explained in the parable of the Good Samaritan. The Levite, who passed by the wounded man without offering him assistance, may have been a man of great honesty; but he did not do unto the poor stranger as he would have wished others to do unto him."

4．Susan pondered carefully and seriously on what her mother had said. When she thought over her past conduct, a blush of shame crept to her cheeks, and a look of sorrow into her eyes, as many little acts of selfishness and unkindness came back to her memory. She resolved that for the future, both in great things and small, she would remember and follow the Golden Rule.

5．It was not long after this that an opportunity occurred of trying Susan's principles. One Saturday evening when she went, as usual, to farmer Thompson's inn, to receive the price of her mother's washing for the boarders, which amounted to five dollars, she found the farmer in the stable yard.

6．He was apparently in a terrible rage with some horse dealers with whom he had been bargaining. He held in his hand an open pocketbook, full of bills; and scarcely noticing the child as she made her request, except to swear at her, as usual, for troubling him when he was busy, he handed her a bank note.

7．Glad to escape so easily, Susan hurried out of the gate, and then, pausing to pin the money safely in the folds of her shawl, she discovered that he had given her two bills instead of one. She looked around; nobody was near to share her discovery; and her first impulse was joy at the unexpected prize.

8．"It is mine, all mine," said she to herself; "I will buy mother a new cloak with it, and she can give her old one to sister Mary, and then Mary can go to the Sunday school with me next winter. I wonder if it will not buy a pair of shoes for brother Tom, too."

9．At that moment she remembered that he must have given it to herby mistake; and therefore she had no right to it. But again the voice of the tempter whispered, "He gave it, and how do you know that he did not intend to make you a present of it? Keep it; he will never know it, even if it should be a mistake; for he had too many such bills in that great pocketbook to miss one."

10．While this conflict(6) was going on in her mind between good and evil, she was hurrying homeward as fast as possible. Yet, before she came in sight of her home, she had repeatedly balanced(7) the comforts which the money would buy against the sin of wronging her neighbor.

11．As she crossed the little bridge over the narrow creek before her mother's door, her eye fell upon a rustic seat which they had occupied during the conversation I have before narrated. Instantly the words of Scripture, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them," sounded in her ears like a trumpet.

12．Turning suddenly round, as if flying from some unseen peril, the child hastened along the road with breathless speed until she found herself once more at farmer Thompson's gate. "What do you want now?" asked the gruff(8) old fellow, as he saw her again at his side.

13．"Sir, you paid me two bills, instead of one," said she, trembling in every limb. "Two bills? did I? let me see; well, so I did; but did you just find it out? Why did you not bring it back sooner?" Susan blushed and hung her head.

14．"You wanted to keep it, I suppose," said he. "Well, I am glad your mother was more honest than you, or I should have been five dollars poorer and none the wiser." "My mother knows nothing about it, sir," said Susan; "I brought it back before I went home."

15．The old man looked at the child, and, as he saw the tears rolling down her cheeks, he seemed touched by her distress. Putting his hand in his pocket, he drew out a shilling and offered it to her.

16．"No, sir, I thank you," sobbed she; "I do not want to be paid for doing right; I only wish you would not think me dishonest, for, indeed, it was a sore temptation. Oh! sir, if you had ever seen those you love best wanting the common comforts of life, you would know how hard it is for us always to do unto others as we would have others do unto us."

17．The heart of the selfish man was touched. "There be things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise," murmured(9) he, as he bade the little girl good night, and entered his house a sadder, and, it is to be hoped, a better man. Susan returned to her humble home with a lightened(10) heart, and through the course of a long and useful life she never forgot her first temptation.



EXERCISES.—What is the Golden Rule? What does it imply? Can a man be perfectly honest and still not follow the Golden Rule? What parable is a perfect illustration of its meaning? How was Susan tempted? What did she first think of doing? What changed her intention? Relate what happened when she returned the money. What effect did her action have?

1．为人正直、办事诚实守信是苏珊的习惯。因此，之前她一直没有想到去验证“黄金法则”，即“无论什么事，你希望别人怎样对待你，你也要怎样对待别人”。但她越是长时间思考这句话，越是笃定地相信她并没有一直遵循这一法则；最后，她去向妈妈请教这句话的含义。

2．“它意味着，”她妈妈说，“首先，彻底摧毁一切自私的心理：如果一个人爱自己比爱邻居更多，他就永远不可能像他期望别人对他那样对待他人。我们一定不只是去帮助别人，还要去体会别人的感受，因为别人也会体会我们的感受。记住，数落别人的不是总比克服我们自己面对的诱惑容易得多。”

3．“一个人可能非常正直，同时还很自私。但是自我约束意味着比单纯的正直更深层次的东西；它需要人们有仁慈之心，为人诚实。自我约束的含义在《善良的撒马利亚人》寓言中得到了充分阐释。路过那个受伤的人而未对其施救的利未夫可能也是个很诚实的人，但是他没有做到对那个可怜的陌生人像他期望别人对待他一样。”

4．苏珊仔细而认真地思考着妈妈说的话。当想到自己过去的表现时，她的小脸因为惭愧而变得绯红，眼里满是懊悔的神情，因为她想起了过去做过的许多自私和刻薄的事。她下定决心，今后无论在大事还是小事上，都会记住并遵守“黄金法则”。

5．这之后没多久，一个考验苏珊的机会来了。一个周六的晚上，她像往常一样去了农民汤姆森的旅店，去收取妈妈给住店客们洗衣服的钱，一共五美元。她在马厩场院里找到了汤姆森。

6．显然他正在和一些马匹交易商发火，原因是他们在跟他讨价还价。他手里拿着一个敞开的皮夹子，里面全是钞票，几乎没有注意小孩子跟他说的话，只是像平常一样骂她几句，说她在他忙的时候给他捣乱，然后递给了她一张钞票。

7．苏珊很高兴这么快就可以离开了，所以快速地跑出了门。随后她停下脚步，准备将钱牢牢地钉在披肩的叠层里。忽然，她发现农民给的钞票是两张，而不是一张。她向四周看了看，附近没有人看到她的发现，而她的第一反应是对这个意料之外的奖金高兴不已。

8．“它是我的了，全是我的，”她自言自语道，“我要给妈妈买件新斗篷，这样她就可以把那件旧的给妹妹玛丽，玛丽明年冬天就可以和我一起去上周日学校了。我想想它是不是还够给弟弟汤姆买双鞋子的。”

9．那时，她想起钱一定是他给错了，所以她没有权利留下。但诱惑的声音又悄悄地说：“他给的，你怎么知道他不是特意想给礼物呢？留着吧，即使是弄错了，他永远也不会知道，因为他的皮夹里有那么多钱，根本想不起来丢了一张。”

10．当善恶在她头脑中不断斗争时，她还在快速地朝着家的方向跑。可是，当她出现在她家视野范围之前，她不停地平衡着金钱带来的慰藉和伤害邻居的罪恶感。

11．她家门前有一条窄窄的小河，河上架着一座小桥。当她经过这座小桥时，她的眼光落在了一个质朴的长椅上，这就是前面提到的对话发生的地方。《圣经》中的那些话语——“无论什么事，你希望别人怎样对待你，你也要怎样对待别人”——立刻像小号的声音一样在她耳边响起。

12．她突然转身，好似从一些看不见的危险里抽身一般，上气不接下气地在路上狂奔，直到她发现自己又来到了农民汤姆森的门口。“你又来要什么？”粗鲁的老家伙看到她回来了，问道。

13．“先生，你给了我两张钞票，不是一张，”她四肢颤抖着说。“两张钞票？是么？让我看看。嗯，是的。但你是刚发现吗？你为什么没早点送回来？”苏珊的脸红了，头也低了下来。

14．“我猜你是想留着，”他说，“我很高兴你妈妈比你诚实，否则我的身家就少了五美元，我也算不得精明了。”“我妈妈不知道这件事，先生，”苏珊说，“我在到家之前就把它送回来了。”

15．那个老人看了看孩子，泪水从她的脸上滚下来，似乎被她的不幸感动了。他把手伸进兜里，掏出一先令给她。

16．“不，先生，谢谢您。”她抽泣着说，“我不愿意您因为我做对了一件事而付给我钱；我只是希望您不会认为我不诚实，因为它确实是个让人很纠结的诱惑。哦！先生，如果您看到您最爱的人想要得到最平常的舒适生活，您就会了解对于我们来说，做到‘我们希望别人怎么对我们，我们也要怎么对待别人’是多么难的事了。”

17．这个自私的男人被打动了。“一些在世界上微不足道的小事，已经远远超出了精明的范畴，”他喃喃自语道。他和小女孩道了晚安，然后有点伤感地走进屋里，但愿他能做一个更善良的人。苏珊心情轻松地回到她简陋的家，之后在漫长而有意义的生命历程中，她再也没有忘记她遇到的第一次诱惑。

The winds pipe(1) loud and shrill!

And high above the white drifts stands

The snow man on the hill.

But has a frozen heart!

LESSON 53

ROBINSON CRUSOE'S HOUSE

鲁滨逊·克鲁索的住所


Daniel DeFoe, the author of "Robinson Crusoe" (from which these selections are adapted), was born in London, England, in 1661, and died in 1731. He wrote a number of books; but his "Robinson Crusoe" is the only one that attained great notoriety.



1．I have already described my habitation(1), which was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale(2) of posts and cables(3), but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turf(4), about two feet thick on the outside; and, after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees and such things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent.

2．I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me; but I must observe, too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, took up all my place, so that I had no room to turn myself. So I set to work to enlarge my cave and work farther into the earth; for it was a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor I bestowed upon it.

3．And so when I found that I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways into the rock; and then, turning to the right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification(5). This gave me not only egress(6) and regress(7), as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow(8) my goods.

4．And now I began to apply(9) myself to make such necessary things as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. I could not write or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure without a table.

5．So I went to work. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet in time by labor, application, and contrivance, I found that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made abundance of things, even without tools, and some with no more tools than an adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, and that with infinite labor.

6．For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it before me, and hew it flat on either side with my ax till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub(10) it smooth with my adz.

7．It is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for the prodigious(11) deal(12) of time and labor which it took me to make a plank or board; but my time or labor was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way as another.

8．However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards which I brought on my raft from the ship; but when I had wrought out some boards, as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and ironwork on, and, in a word, to separate everything at large in their places, that I might come easily at them.

9．I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that would hang up. So that, had my cave been seen, it would have looked like a general magazine(13) of all necessary things; and I had everything so ready at my hand that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great.



EXERCISES.—How did Robinson Crusoe make a house? Of what did he make a chair and table? How did he obtain boards? What does this lesson teach us in regard to perseverance?





【中文阅读】


本文摘自《鲁滨逊漂流记》，作者：丹尼尔·笛福，1661年生于英国伦敦，1731年去世。在他的多部作品中，最著名的是《鲁滨逊漂流记》。

1．我前面已经描述了我的住所，这是一个帐篷，位于山岩一侧，周围是用木桩和缆绳搭造的结实的栅栏，我现在也可以把这个栅栏称作墙，因为在栅栏的外面我堆砌了两英尺厚的草皮；过了一段时间（我想是一年半）我架起了椽，一端靠在岩石上，用树枝等材料封了顶，可以在暴雨倾盆时用来避雨。

2．我把所有物品拿进栅栏，放到岩洞里；但是开始的时候东西堆得杂乱无章，很占地方，我甚至无法转身。因此我着手扩大岩洞，挖出更多的泥土。因为岩石已经疏松沙化了，挖掘起来很容易。

3．当我发现自己相当安全，不用担心野兽的攻击时，我开始挖掘山岩的侧面；然后又向右挖，一直挖到外面，这样我就能从另一扇门通到栅栏或者说堡垒的外面。我不但多了出口和入口，进出帐篷和工具间，而且贮藏的空间也扩大了。

4．这时我开始专心制作最需要的物品，尤其是椅子和桌子；没有桌椅，我就没法享受世上为数已不多的乐事。没有桌椅，写作、吃饭也毫无乐趣可言了。

5．我开始工作起来，我以前从未使用过工具；可是当我后来花费了很大力气，专心工作，想出不少好点子的时候，我发现不论需要什么，我都能做出来，要是有工具就更好了。即使没有工具，我还是做了不少东西，有时只使用锛子和斧头，可能以前还没人这样做出这些东西，或者花这么大的力气。

6．比如，如果我想要一块木板，就必须先砍倒一棵树，然后用斧子把两面销平，直到树木像木板一样薄，再用锛子刮光滑。

7．真的，我就这么把整棵树做成了木板；做木板要花费很多时间和力气，需要很大的耐心，好在我时间和力气多得是。

8．前面提到过，我从离开大船时乘坐的木筏上拆了一些木板做了桌椅；当用上面的方法做了一些木板后，我还把一些一英尺半宽的隔板，立在岩洞的侧面，放置工具、钉子和铁器，总之，我把所有工具摆放整齐，便于取用。

9．我还把一些木棒钉进山岩，悬挂枪和别的能挂起来的东西。因此，要是有人看到，我的岩洞就像是仓库，所有必备的物品应有尽有。看到一切井井有条，带给我极大的乐趣，我的东西可真不少呢。

LESSON 54

ROBINSON CRUSOE'S DRESS

鲁滨逊·克鲁索的衣服


1．But had any man in England met such a man as I was, it must either have frightened him or raised a great deal of laughter; and, as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my traveling through Yorkshire in such a dress.

2．I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.



3．I had a short jacket of goatskin, the skirts coming down to about the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of an old goat, and the hair hung down such a length on either side that it reached to the middle of my legs like pantaloons.

4．Stockings and shoes I had none; but I made a pair of something, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins(1), to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes(2); but they were of a most barbarous(3) shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

5．I had on a broad belt of goatskin dried, which I drew together with two thongs(4) of the same, instead of buckles; and, in a kind of frog(5) on each side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and hatchet; one on one side, and one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches(6), both made of goatskin, too; in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot.

6．At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great, clumsy, ugly, goatskin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun.

7．As for my face, the color of it was really not so dark as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equator. My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but, as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks.

8．Of these mustaches or whiskers, I will not say that they were long enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous(7) enough, and such as in England would have passed for frightful. But all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say no more on that part.





【中文阅读】


1．在英国，任何人看到我的样子，一定被吓着或者被逗得开怀大笑；当我不时一动不动打量自己的时候，想到穿着这身打扮走在约克郡的路上就忍俊不禁。

2．我的帽子是用山羊皮做的，又高又大，没有帽子的形状，后面垂下一个帽檐，既遮阳，又可以防止雨水流进脖子里；没有比让雨水流进衣服沾到皮肤更有害的了。

3．我穿着一件山羊皮做的上衣，上衣的下摆垂到大腿中部，还穿着件相同材料的露着膝盖的短裙；短裙是用老山羊皮做成的，两侧的羊毛垂到膝盖，像马裤一样。

4．我没有袜子和鞋；但是做了一双类似的东西，我几乎不知道该称它什么，有点像高筒靴，像绑腿一样从两侧系在腿上；它们的形状极其原始，实际上我的其他穿着也一样原始。

5．我系着一个晒干的山羊皮做的宽皮带，用相同材料的皮条系住，而不是用搭扣；在皮带两侧的饰扣里，悬挂的不是剑和匕首，而是小锯和斧子。我还有另一个皮带，不这么宽，也用山羊皮的皮条系着，斜搭在肩上；我的左腋下的一端，挂着两个山羊皮做的口袋；一个口袋装着火药，另一个口袋装着子弹。

6．我的身后背着筐，肩上扛着枪，头上顶着一把巨大的、样子笨拙而丑陋的山羊皮做的雨伞，这是除枪以外最有用的东西。

7．至于我的脸，对于像我这样不太在乎，而且生活在距离赤道九或十度以内的人，还不算黑。我容忍胡须长到大约四分之一码长；由于有剪子和剃刀，我把胡须剪得相当短，至于上唇上的胡子，我把它们修剪成和伊斯兰教徒的胡子一样，就像我见过的土耳其人。

8．关于这些八字胡，我不想说它们长得足以悬挂帽子，但是它们的长度和形状非常古怪，如果在英国会吓着人的。但是所有这些都无关紧要，因为几乎没有人看到我，怎么穿着打扮都没有多大关系。因此，我就不多说了。

LESSON 55

SOMEBODY'S DARLING

谁的亲人沉睡在这里


1．Into a ward of the whitewashed halls,

Where the dead and dying lay,

Wounded by bayonets(1), shells, and balls,

Somebody's darling(2) was borne one day;

2．Somebody's darling, so young and brave,

Wearing yet on his pale, sweet face,

Soon to be hid by the dust of the grave,

The lingering(3) light of his boyhood's grace.

3．Matted(4) and damp are the curls of gold,

Kissing the snow of that fair young brow;

Pale are the lips of delicate(5) mold(6)—

Somebody's darling is dying now.

4．Back from his beautiful, blue-veined brow,

Brush all the wandering(7) waves of gold;

Cross his hands on his bosom now;

Somebody's darling is still and cold.

5．Kiss him once for somebody's sake,

Murmur a prayer soft and low;

One bright curl from its fair mates take;

They were somebody's pride, you know;

6．Somebody's hand has rested there;

Was it a mother's, soft and white?

And have the lips of a sister fair

Been baptized in the waves of light?

7．God knows best! he was somebody's love:

Somebody's heart enshrined(8) him there;

Somebody wafted(9) his name above,

Night and morn, on the wings of prayer.

8．Somebody wept when he marched away,

Looking so handsome, brave, and grand;

Somebody's kiss on his forehead lay;

Somebody clung to his parting hand.

9．Somebody's watching and waiting for him,

Yearning(10) to hold him again to her heart;

And there he lies, with his blue eyes dim,

And the smiling, childlike lips apart.

10．Tenderly(11) bury the fair young dead,

Pausing to drop on his grave a tear;

Carve on the wooden slab at his head,

"Somebody's darling slumbers here."

一间病房，那里躺着

已死和垂死的人，

甜美的面孔，却苍白如纸，

可这青年英俊的光芒，

亲吻着年轻美丽的前额；

纤弱的双唇如此苍白——

金色的卷发荡漾着波澜；

双手交叉在胸前；

谁的亲人已无法动弹。

5．替他的亲人与他吻别，

柔和地低声为他祷告；

那一缕金色的卷发；

曾经是谁的骄傲；

6．亲人的手放在他的身上；

是母亲的手吗，柔和而白皙？

是他美丽的爱人祷告的双唇吗，

浸润在清晨的阳光里？

7．上帝知道！谁是他的亲人，

谁把他珍藏在心里；

日日夜夜的祷告声里，

阵阵重复着他的名字。

8．他奔向战场时，又有谁在啜泣，

如此英俊、勇敢和骄傲；

谁亲吻着他的前额；

抓着他的手不忍分离。

9．谁在注视和等待着他，

渴望再次与他相拥；

他却躺着，眼睛黯然无光，

天真的双唇轻启泛着笑容。

10．轻轻埋葬了年轻的美丽身躯，

停在墓前泪水轻轻滴落；

在头部的一块木牌上，刻着，

“谁的亲人沉睡在这里。”

LESSON 56

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER

知识的力量


1．"What an excellent thing is knowledge," said a sharp-looking, bustling little man, to one who was much older than himself. "Knowledge is an excellent thing," repeated he. "My boys know more at six and seven years old than I did at twelve. They can read all sorts of books, and talk on all sorts of subjects(1). The world is a great deal wiser than it used to he. Everybody knows something of everything now. Do you not think, sir, that knowledge is all excellent thing?"

2．"Why, sir," replied the old man, looking grave, "that depends entirely upon the use to which it is applied. It may be a blessing or a curse. Knowledge is only an increase of power, and power may be a bad, as well as a good thing." "That is what I can not understand," said the bustling(2) little man. "How can power be a bad thing?"

3．"I will tell you," meekly(3) replied the old man; and thus he went on: "When the power of a horse is under restraint(4), the animal is useful in bearing burdens(5), drawing loads, and carrying his master; but when that power is unrestrained, the horse breaks his bridle, dashes to pieces the carriage that he draws, or throws his rider." "I see!" said the little man.

4．"When the water of a large pond is properly conducted(6) by trenches(7), it renders the fields around fertile(8); but when it bursts through its banks, it sweeps everything before it and destroys the produce(9) of the fields." "I see!" said the little man, "I see!"

5．"When the ship is steered(10) aright, the sail that she hoists(11) enables her sooner to get into port; but if steered wrong, the more sail she carries the further will she go out of her course." "I see!" said the little man, "I see clearly!"

6．"Well, then," continued the old man, "if you see these things so clearly, I hope you can see, too, that knowledge, to be a good thing, must be rightly applied(12). God's grace in the heart will render the knowledge of the head a blessing; but without this, it may prove to us no better than a curse." "I see! I see!" said the little man, "I see!"



EXERCISES—What is the subject of this lesson? Is knowledge always a power? Is it always blessing? Relate the several examples of power wrongly used. If we use the powers that God has given us for bad purposes, what will our knowledge prove to be?

1．“知识是多么非同寻常啊，”一位长相瘦削，精力充沛的小个子男人对一位老年人说。“知识是多么非同寻常啊，”他重复道。“六七岁大的男孩子们比我十二岁的时候懂得更多。他们读的书多，谈论的话题也多。世界比以前变聪明了。现在人人对所有事都有所了解。先生，你不认为知识真的非同寻常吗？”

2．“这个嘛，先生，”老人回答说，他看起来很严肃，“那完全取决于知识用在什么地方。知识可能是好事，也可能是祸根。知识意味着力量的增加，而力量既可能是好事，也可能是坏事。”“我无法理解你说的话，”精力旺盛的小个子说，“力量怎么可能是坏事呢？”

3．“我这就跟你讲，”老人温和地回答，接下来他说道：“当马匹的力量得到约束，这牲口可以用来负重、拉货、驮主人；但是当这种力量不受约束，马会脱缰，飞奔的时候把车拖碎，或者把主人掀下来。”“我明白了！”小个子说道。

4．“当池塘里的水用沟渠进行适当的疏导，可以灌溉周围的田地；但是如果水冲出堤坝，它会冲走一切，摧毁地里的收成。”“我明白了！”小个子说，“我明白了！”

5．“当正确地驾驶船，它升起的帆能让船更早驶入港口；但是如果驾驶错误，船的帆会让船驶离航线。”“我明白了！”小个子说，“我清楚地明白了！”

6．“好吧，那么，”老人继续说，“如果你清楚地明白这些事，我希望你也能明白，要想让知识成为好事，必须正确使用它。心中带着主的恩宠，知识就会变成好事；可是，如果没有做到，知识就和祸根一样了。”“我明白了！我明白了！”小个子说道，“我明白了！”

LESSON 57

GOOD WILL

善　意


1．I suppose you all, my boys, are looking for some sort of success in life; it is right that you should; but what are your notions of success? To get rich as soon as possible, without regard to the means by which your wealth is acquired?

2．There is no true success in that: when you have gained millions, you may yet be poorer than when you had nothing; and it is that same reckless ambition which has brought many a bright and capable boy, not to great estate at last, but to miserable failure and disgrace; not to a palace, but to a prison.

3．Wealth rightly got and rightly used, rational enjoyment, power, fame,—these are all worthy objects of ambition; but they are not the highest objects, and you may acquire them all without achieving true success. But if, whatever you seek, you put good will into all your actions, you are sure of the best success at last; for whatever else you gain or miss, you are building up a noble and beautiful character(1), which is not only the best of possessions in this world, but also is about all you can expect to take with you into the next.

4．I say, good will in all your actions. You are not simply to be kind and helpful to others; but, whatever you do, give honest, earnest purpose(2) to it. Thomas is put by his parents to learn a business. But Thomas does not like to apply himself very closely. "What's the use?" he says. "I'm not paid much, and I'm not going to work much. I’ll get along just as easily as I can, and have as good times as I can."

5．So he shirks his tasks; and instead of thinking about his employer's interests, or his own self improvement, gives his mind to trifles,—often to evil things, which in their ruinous effects upon his life are not trifles. As soon as he is free from his daily duties, he is off with his companions, having what they call a good time; his heart is with them even while his hands are employed in the shop or store.

6．He does nothing thoroughly well,—not at all for want of talent, but solely for lack of good will. He is not preparing himself to be one of those efficient clerks or workmen who are always in demand, and who receive the highest wages.

7．There is a class of people who are the pest of every community, workmen who do not know their trade, men of business ignorant of the first principles(3) of business. They can never be relied upon to do well anything they undertake. They are always making blunders which other people have to suffer for, and which react upon themselves. They are always getting out of employment, and failing in business.

8．To make up for what they lack in knowledge and thoroughness, they often resort to trick and fraud, and become not merely contemptible but criminal. Thomas is preparing himself to be one of this class. You can not, boys, expect to raise a good crop from evil seed.

9．By Thomas's side works another boy, whom we will call James,—a lad of only ordinary capacity(4), very likely. If Thomas and all the other boys did their best, there would be but small chance for James ever to become eminent. But he has something better than talent: he brings good will to his work. Whatever he learns, he learns so well that it becomes a part of himself.

10．His employers find that they can depend upon him. Customers soon learn to like and trust him. By diligence, self-culture, good habits, cheerful and kindly conduct, he is laying the foundation of a generous manhood and a genuine success.

11．In short, boys, by slighting your tasks you hurt yourself more than you wrong your employer. By honest service you benefit yourself more than you help him. If you were aiming at mere worldly advancement only, I should still say that good will was the very best investment you could make in business.

12．By cheating a customer, you gain only a temporary and unreal advantage. By serving him with right good will,—doing by him as you would be done by,—you not only secure his confidence but also his good will in return. But this is a sordid(5) consideration compared with the inward satisfaction, the glow and expansion of soul which attend a good action done for itself alone. If I were to sum up all I have to say to you in one last word of love and counsel, that one word should be—Good will.



(J. T. Trowbridge)



EXERCISES. — What is meant by the phrase "to apply himself," in the fourth paragraph? What is meant by "a generous manhood," tenth paragraph? By "expansion of soul," twelfth paragraph? Tell what is meant by "good will," as taught by this lesson. How did Tom and James differ in character?

1．我的孩子们，你们一定想在生活中取得成功；你应该这么做，这是对的；但是成功的概念是什么呢？是尽快致富，而不考虑获取财富的方式吗？

2．这样做不会带来真正的成功：当你成为百万富翁时，你可能比一无所有更贫穷；同样，不计后果的野心，最后常常不会给聪明能干的孩子带来财富，而是惨痛的失败和耻辱；等待他们的不是宫殿，而是监狱。

3．正确获得和使用财富、理性享受、得到权力和荣誉，这些目标都值得追求；但是它们不是最高的目标，而且即使没有获得真正的成功，也可以取得这一切。可是，不论你追求的是什么，如果你都带着善意去做，你最后一定会取得最大的成功；因为不论你得到或失去什么，你都在培养高尚良好的品格，这不仅是这个世界上最好的财富，也是你能期望带到下一世的所有财富。

4．我说，你所有的行为必须带着善意。不是简单的善良，乐于助人；而是，不论你做什么，带着诚实认真的意图去做。托马斯的父母让他学习做生意。可是托马斯并不全力以赴。“有什么用呢？”他说，“我的报酬低，因此我不会干太多的工作。我得过且过，过得轻松愉快就行了。”

5．他因此在面对工作时不主动上前；不考虑雇主的利益，或者提高自己的能力，只考虑微不足道的——这些事常常是有害的，同样这些事对他的人生具有毁灭性的后果，这可不是微不足道的。一做完日常的工作，他马上就和伙伴们出去玩，正如他们自己说的，享受快乐的时光；即使手头做着店里或仓库里的工作，他的心也飞到伙伴们那里去了。

6．他从不尽力把工作做到最好，这完全不是因为缺乏才智，只是因为缺乏善意。他不愿意让自己成为一名有效率的职员或工人，可是这些人总是很抢手，收入也最高。

7．有一种人是所有人群里的害虫，工人不懂业务，商人不了解商业第一法则。你永远不能指望他们做好任何工作。他们不断出错，给别人添麻烦，反过来也影响自己。他们总是失业，经商也失败。

8．因为缺乏知识，做事欠考虑，他们常常耍把戏欺骗别人，因此他们不但可憎甚至会滑向犯罪。托马斯就是其中的一个。孩子们，你们不能期望邪恶的种子会长出好的庄稼。

9．托马斯身边还有一个男孩，就称他詹姆斯吧，他很可能才能一般。如果托马斯和别的男孩子全力以赴，詹姆斯变得杰出的机会微乎其微。但是他具有比才智更好的品质：他带着善意工作。无论学什么，他都学得很好，并且与所学的知识融为一体。

10．雇主们发现可以信赖吉姆。客户们很快开始喜欢和信任他。通过勤奋、自我培养、良好的习惯、热情亲切的行为，他正在为具有慷慨的人格和真正的成功奠定良好的基础。

11．总之，孩子们，如果轻视工作，你不但无法公正地对待雇主，而且更多地伤害了自己。通过诚实服务，你让雇主受益，也更多地让自己受益。即使你的目标仅仅是物质上的成就，我仍然要说，善意是你对事业唯一最好的投资。

12．欺骗客户，你得到的只是暂时的利益，这是不真实的。但是如果带着善意服务客户，将心比心，你不但可以赢得客户的信任，而且还能得到客户的善意回报。但是与获得内心的满足，心灵的喜悦和充实相比，这种考虑确是微不足道的，伴随每个善行的心灵的喜悦和充实是没有他求的。如果要我用一个词总结我对你们说的关于爱和关心的话，这个词就是——善意。



（J·T·特罗布里奇）

LESSON 58

A CHINESE STORY

中国故事一则


By Christopher Pearse Cranch, who was born at Alexandria, Va. (then D. C.), in 1813. He has written some well-known children's stories, besides numerous poems; but his greatest literary work is "The AEneid of Vergil, translated into English blank verse." He died in Cambridge Mass., 1892.

1．Two young, near-sighted(1) fellows, Chang and Ching,

Over their chopsticks(2) idly chattering,

Fell to disputing which could see the best;

At last, they agreed to put it to the test.

Said Chang, "A marble tablet(3), so I hear,

Is placed upon the Bo-hee temple near,

With an inscription(4) on it. Let us go

And read it (since you boast your optics(5) so),

Standing together at a certain place

In front, where we the letters just may trace;

Then he who quickest reads the inscription there,

The palm(6) for keenest eyes henceforth shall bear."

"Agreed," said Ching, "but let us try it soon:

Suppose we say to-morrow afternoon."

2．"Nay, not so soon," said Chang; "I'm bound to go

To-morrow a day's ride from Hoang-Ho,

And sha'n't be ready till the following day:

At ten A. M(7)., on Thursday, let us say."

3．So 't was arranged; but Ching was wide-awake:

Time by the forelock he resolved to take;

And to the temple went at once, and read,

Upon the tablet, "To the illustrious dead,

The chief of mandarins(8), the great Goh-Bang."

Scarce had he gone when stealthily came Chang,

Who read the same; but peering closer, he

Spied in a corner what Ching failed to see—

The words, "This tablet is erected here

By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear."

4．So on the appointed day—both innocent

As babes, of course—these honest fellows went,

And took their distant station; and Ching said,

"I can read plainly, 'To the illustrious dead,

The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang.'"

"And is that all that you can spell?" said Chang;

"I see what you have read, but furthermore,

In smaller letters, toward the temple door,

Quite plain, 'This tablet is erected here

By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.'"

5．"My sharp-eyed friend, there are no such words!" said Ching.

"They're there," said Chang, "if I see anything,

As clear as daylight." "Patent(9) eyes, indeed,

You have!" cried Ching; "do you think I can not read?"

"Not at this distance as I can," Chang said,

"If what you say you saw is all you read."

6．In fine, they quarreled, and their wrath increased,

Till Chang said, "Let us leave it to the priest;



Lo! here he comes to meet us." "It is well,"

Said honest Ching; "no falsehood he will tell."

7．The good man heard their artless story through,

And said, "I think, dear sirs, there must be few

Blest with such wondrous eyes as those you wear:

There's no such tablet or inscription there!

There was one, it is true; 't was moved away

And placed within the temple yesterday."

1．常和庆是两个年轻的近视眼，

饭桌上闲谈时争执起谁的眼力好，

最后他们决定来较量；

常说，“附近有个武夷庙，

庙前立了一块石碑，

碑上刻着碑文，我们去看看

碑文（既然你吹嘘你的眼力好），

站在石碑前面一定距离，

刚好看见上面文字的地方，

谁最快读出碑上的文字，

谁的视力就最好。”

庆说，“同意，我们尽快比，

明天下午怎么样？”

2．常说，“不用这么早，我还有

一天的行程，骑马从黄河出发，

后天才能回来，

周四上午十点再较量吧。”

3．这样决定了，庆睡不着觉：

天刚蒙蒙亮他就出发了；

到了庙前看石碑上写着，

“这里埋葬着杰出的满洲首领，

伟大的国邦。”

他刚刚离开常就偷偷溜来，

他也看到了同样的碑文，

可他更仔细，

发现碑角上写着——

“这个石碑是

敬爱国邦的人所立。”

这是庆没看到的。

4．约定的日子转眼就到了——

两个孩子般诚实的人来到碑前，

站得很远，庆说，

“我清楚看到碑上写着，

‘这里埋葬着杰出的满洲首领，

伟大的国邦。’”

常说，“就只有这些吗？”

“我不但看到你读的这些，而且

朝向庙门的碑角还有小字，

清楚写着，‘这个石碑是

敬爱国邦的人所立。’”

5．“我好眼神的朋友，没有这些文字！”常说，

“我清楚地看到了，”庆说，“碑上刻着这些文字，

就和白天一样清楚。”“你的眼睛真特别，

难道你以为我不识字吗？”

“从这么远可不像我能识字，”常说，

“如果你说你看到的是全部文字。”

6．他们越吵越凶，满腔怒火，

最后常说，“让主持来裁判吧；

看！他走过来了。”“这样最好，”

诚实的庆说；“他可从不说谎。”

7．善良的主持听了他们可爱的故事，

说，“我想，亲爱的先生们，肯定有几个人，

眼神和你们一样好：

可那里既没石碑，也没碑文！

以前是有；没错，可是已经挪走了，

昨天被我们移到庙里了。”

LESSON 59

THE WAY TO BE HAPPY

幸福之道


1．Every child must observe how much more happy and beloved some children are than others. There are some children you always love to be with. They are happy themselves, and they make you happy.

2．There are others whom you always avoid. They seem to have no friends. No person can be happy without friends. The heart is formed for love, and can not be happy without it.

3．"'T is not in titles nor in rank,

'T is not in wealth like London bank,

To make us truly blest.

If happiness have not her seat

And center in the breast,

We may be wise, or rich, or great,

But never can be blest."

4．But you can not receive affection unless you will also give it. You can not find others to love you unless you will also love them. Love is only to be obtained by giving love in return. Hence the importance of cultivating(1) a good disposition. You can not be happy without it.

5．I have sometimes heard a girl say, "I know that I am very unpopular(2) at school." Now, this plainly shows that she is not amiable.

6．If your companions(3) do not love you, it is your own fault. They can not help loving you if you will be kind and friendly. If you are not loved, it is a good proof that you do not deserve to be loved. It is true that a sense of duty may, at times, render it necessary for you to do that which will displease your companions.

7．But if it is seen that you have a noble spirit, that you are above selfishness, that you are willing to make sacrifices(4) to promote(5) the happiness of others, you will never be in want of friends.

8．You must not regard it as your misfortune that others do not love you, but your fault. It is not beauty, it is not wealth, that will give you friends. Your heart must glow with kindness, if you would attract to yourself the esteem and affection of those around you.

9．You are little aware how much the happiness of your whole life depends upon the cultivation of a good disposition. If you will adopt the resolution that you will confer favors whenever you can, you will certainly be surrounded by ardent friends. Begin upon this principle in childhood, and act upon it through life, and you will make yourself happy, and promote the happiness of all within your influence.

10．You go to school on a cold winter morning. A bright fire is blazing in the stove, surrounded with boys struggling to get near it to warm themselves. After you are slightly warmed, a schoolmate comes in suffering(6) with cold. "Here, James," you pleasantly call out to him, "I am almost warm; you may have my place."

11．As you slip aside to allow him to take your place at the fire, will he not feel that you are kind? The worst boy in the world can not help admiring such generosity(7); and, even though he be so ungrateful as not to return the favor, you may depend upon it that he will be your friend as far as he is capable of friendship. If you will always act upon this principle, you will never want for friends.

12．Suppose, some day, you are out with your companions playing ball. After you have been playing for some time, another boy comes along. He can not be chosen upon either side, for there is no one to match him. "Henry," you say, "you may take my place a little while, and I will rest."

13．You throw yourself down upon the grass, while Henry, fresh and vigorous, takes your bat and engages in the game. He knows that you give up to oblige him, and how can he help liking you for it? The fact is, that neither man nor child can cultivate such a spirit of generosity and kindness without attracting affection and esteem.

14．Look and see which of your companions have the most friends, and you will find that they are those who have this noble spirit; who are willing to deny themselves, that they may make others happy. There is but one way to make friends; and that is, by being friendly to others.

15．Perhaps some child who reads this feels conscious of being disliked, and yet desires to have the affection of his companions. You ask me what you shall do. I will tell you. I will give you an infallible(8) rule: Do all in your power to make others happy. Be willing to make sacrifices, that you may promote the happiness of others.

16．This is the way to make friends, and the only way. When you are playing with your brothers and sisters at home, be always ready to give them more than their share of privileges. Manifest(9) an obliging disposition, and they can not but regard you with affection. In all your intercourse(10) with others, at home or abroad, let these feelings influence you, and you will receive a rich reward.



EXERCISES.—What is this lesson about? Can we be happy without friends? How can we win the love of those about us? Whose fault is it if we are not loved? What rule will surely gain us love and friendship if we always follow it?





【中文阅读】


1．你一定注意到，一些孩子比其他孩子更幸福更惹人喜爱。有一些孩子，你总是喜欢和他们在一起。他们自己幸福，也让你感到幸福。

2．还有一些孩子你总想躲避。似乎他们没有朋友。没有朋友谁也不会幸福。心是为爱而生的，没有爱，心不可能幸福。

3．“让我们真正幸福的，

既不是头衔或地位，

也不是和伦敦银行一样多的财富。

如果我们心中

没有幸福的位置

我们可能会聪明、富有、伟大，

但是永远不会幸福。”

4．除非你愿意给予爱，否则你无法得到它。如果你不爱别人，你会发现别人也不会爱你。爱只能通过给予才能获得。因此培养良好的性格非常重要。没有良好性格的人不会幸福。

5．我曾听一个女孩子说：“我知道我在学校非常不受欢迎。”这显然表明她不是个友好的人。

6．如果你的伙伴不爱你，这是你自己的错。如果你愿意做一个善良和友好的人，他们无法不爱你。如果别人不爱你，这证明你不值得爱。尽管责任感有时让你必须做使伙伴感到不快的事，这是个事实。

7．但是如果他人看到你有一颗高尚的心灵，超越自私，愿意为他人的幸福牺牲自己，你永远也不会缺少朋友。

8．如果别人不爱你，你不要认为这是你的不幸，而是你的过错。使你拥有朋友的不是美丽，也不是财富。如果你想赢得周围人的尊敬和友谊，你的心必须洋溢着善意。

9．你很少意识到你整个生命的幸福是多么有赖于对良好性格的培养。如果你决心不论何时只要你有能力就帮助他人，你当然会被热心的朋友包围。从童年起就遵循这一原则，整个一生都奉行它，你将会让自己幸福，并能使受到你影响的人幸福。

10．一个寒冷冬日的清晨你来到学校。炉子里火很旺，四周坐满了取暖的男孩子们。在你稍微暖和后，一个同学走进来，浑身发冷。“到这里，詹姆斯，”你友好地朝他喊道，“我暖和得差不多了，你坐我这儿吧。”

11．当你走到旁边让他坐在你的位置时，他会感觉不到你的善意吗？世界上最坏的孩子也会赞赏这种慷慨；即使他不领情，没有投桃报李，你也可以相信只要他具有交友的能力，他就会是你的朋友。如果你始终奉行这个原则，你永远不会缺少朋友。

12．假设有一天你和伙伴在外面打球。在你玩了一会儿后，一个男孩走过来。他无法加入，因为哪边都不缺人手。“亨利，”你说，“你可以打我的位置，我歇一会。”

13．你躺在草地上，而新来的亨利浑身是劲，接替你加入比赛。他知道你为了帮助他放弃了比赛，他会不喜欢你吗？事实是，不论大人还是孩子，培养了这种慷慨和善良的精神，没有得不到情谊和敬重的。

14．观察一下，看你的伙伴里哪一个朋友最多，你会发现一定是具有这种高尚心灵的人，他们为了让他人幸福愿意克制自己。交友的办法只有一个，就是对人友善。

15．可能有的孩子读到这里意识到自己不受人喜欢，可是希望得到伙伴们的情谊。你问我该怎么做，我会告诉你。我会给你一条绝对有效的法则：尽全力使他人幸福，愿意为促进他人的幸福做出牺牲。

16．这就是交友之道，唯一的交友之道。当你在家里和兄弟姐妹玩，你应该总是愿意给予他们更多的权利。显示一颗乐于助人的心，他们会把爱心给你。在你和他人的交往中，不论在家里还是外面，拥有这种感情，你就会得到丰厚的回报。

LESSON 60

THE GIRAFFE

长颈鹿


1．The giraffe is a native of Africa. It is of singular shape and size, and bears some resemblance both to the camel and the deer. The mouth is small; the eyes are full and brilliant(1); the tongue is rough, very long, and ending in a point. The neck is long and slender, and, from the shoulder to the top of the head, it measures between seven and eight feet; from the ground to the top of the shoulder, it is commonly ten or eleven feet; so that the height of a full-grown giraffe is seventeen or eighteen feet.

2．The hair is of a deep brown color in the male, and of a light or yellowish brown in the female. The skin is beautifully diversified(2) with white spots. They have short, blunt horns, and hoofs like those of the ox. In their wild state, they feed on the leaves of a gum-bearing tree peculiar(3) to warm climates.

3．The giraffe, like the horse and other hoofed animals, defends itself by kicking; and its hinder limbs are so light, and its blows so rapid, that the eye can not follow them. They are sufficient for its defense against the lion. It never employs its horns in resisting the attack of an enemy. Its disposition is gentle, and it flees to its native forest upon the least alarm.

4．Le Vaillant (the celebrated French traveler and naturalist(4)) was the first who gave us any exact account of the form and habits of the giraffe. While he was traveling in South Africa, he happened one day to discover a hut covered with the skin of one of those animals; and learned to his surprise that he was now in a part of the country where the creature was found. He could not rest contented until he had seen the animal alive, and had secured a specimen(5).

5．Having on several days obtained sight of some of them, he, with his attendants, on horseback and accompanied with dogs, gave chase; but they baffled(6) all pursuit. After a chase of a whole day, which effected nothing but the fatigue(7) of the party, he began to despair of success.

6．"The next day," says he, "by sunrise, I was in pursuit of game, in the hope of obtaining some provisions for my men. After several hours' fatigue, we saw, at the turn of a hill, seven giraffes, which my pack of dogs instantly pursued. Six of them went off together; but the seventh, cut off by my dogs, took another way.

7．"I followed the single one at full speed, but, in spite of the efforts of my horse, she got so much ahead of me, that, in turning a little hill, I lost sight of her altogether, and I gave up the pursuit. My dogs, however, were not so easily exhausted. They were soon so close upon her that she was obliged to stop and defend herself. From the noise they made, I conjectured(8) that they had got the animal into a corner, and I again pushed forward.

8．"I had scarcely got round the hill, when I perceived her surrounded by the dogs, and endeavoring to drive them away by heavy kicks. In a moment I was on my feet, and a shot from my carbine(9) brought her to the earth. I was delighted with my victory, which enabled me to add to the riches of natural history. I was now able, also, to destroy the romance(10) which attached to this animal, and to establish the truth of its existence."



EXERCISES.—Of what country is the giraffe a native? To what height does it attain when full grown? On what does it live? How does it defend itself? Relate the story of Le Vaillant's giraffe hunt.





【中文阅读】


1．长颈鹿产自非洲，是一种外形和尺寸独特的动物，与骆驼和鹿都有相似的特征。口部很小；眼睛又圆又亮；舌头粗糙，而且很长，舌尖很尖。脖子细长，从肩到头顶有七到八英尺；自地面到肩，一般有十或十一英尺；因此一个成年的长颈鹿的高度是十七或十八英尺。

2．雄长颈鹿的毛是深灰色的，而雌长颈鹿的毛是淡褐色或黄褐色的。长颈鹿的皮肤上有漂亮的白点。长颈鹿的角是短的，并不尖锐，蹄子和牛的相似。野生状态的长颈鹿吃含树胶的树叶，这种树是气候温暖的地方特有的。

3．像马或其他有蹄类动物一样，长颈鹿用踢腿来保护自己；长颈鹿的后肢非常灵巧，踢的时候快得我们的眼睛都跟不上。这使长颈鹿甚至可以和狮子对抗。长颈鹿从来不用角来对付敌人。它脾气温和，得到轻微的警报就会跑回森林。

4．勒·瓦扬（法国著名旅行家和博物学家）是第一个为我们精确描述长颈鹿的外形和生活习性的人。他在南非旅行时，一天碰巧发现了一个棚屋上覆盖着长颈鹿的鹿皮；他惊讶地了解到这里就是发现长颈鹿的地方。除非亲自看到野生的长颈鹿，取得标本，否则他无法安心。

5．后来有几天他看到了一些长颈鹿，因此他和助手骑着马，带着猎犬，开始追踪；但是没有追到。后来在追了整整一天后，队伍疲劳极了却一无所获，他开始丧失信心了。

6．“第二天，”他说，“黎明的时候，我正在追逐猎物，希望为我们的人弄一些吃的。几个小时后，在一个山丘的拐弯处，我们见到七只长颈鹿，猎犬立刻追过去。六只长颈鹿一起奔跑；但是第七只长颈鹿被猎犬拦截，向另一个方向跑去。

7．“我全速追赶这只落单的长颈鹿，但是不论我的马怎么使劲，它就是远远地跑在前面，绕过一个小山丘的时候，我完全见不到它了，于是我放弃了追赶。可是，我的猎犬可不是那么容易疲倦的。它们很快接近了长颈鹿，使它不得不停下来抵抗。从它们发出的声音，我猜测猎犬把长颈鹿困住了，我重新骑马追过去。

8．“我刚绕过小山丘，就看见猎犬包围了长颈鹿，长颈鹿用力踢，试图赶走猎犬。我立刻跳下马，用卡宾枪射出一枚子弹把长颈鹿打倒在地。我对胜利感到非常高兴，我可以为博物学增添新的财富了。我也打破了关于这个动物的浪漫神话，证明它确实存在。”

LESSON 61

THE LOST CHILD

失踪的孩子


1．A few years since, a child was lost in the woods. He was out with his brothers and sisters gathering berries, and was accidentally separated(1) from them, and lost. The children, after looking in vain for some time in search of the little wanderer, returned, just in the dusk of the evening, to inform their parents that their brother was lost and could not be found.

2．The woods, at that time, were full of bears. The darkness of a cloudy night was rapidly coming on, and the alarmed father, gathering a few of his neighbors, hastened in search of the lost child. The mother remained at home, almost distracted(2) with suspense(3).

3．As the clouds gathered, and the darkness increased, the father and the neighbors, with highly excited fears, traversed(4) the woods in all directions, and raised loud shouts to attract the attention of the child. But their search was in vain. They could find no trace of the wanderer; and, as they stood under the boughs of the lofty trees, and listened, that if possible they might hear his feeble voice, no sound was borne to their ears but the melancholy moaning of the wind as it swept through the thick branches of the forest.

4．The gathering clouds threatened an approaching storm, and the deep darkness of the night had already enveloped them. It is difficult to conceive what were the feelings of that father. And who could imagine how deep the distress which filled the bosom of that mother, as she heard the wind, and beheld the darkness in which her child was wandering!

5．The search was continued in vain till nine o'clock in the evening. Then, one of the party was sent back to the village, to collect the inhabitants for a more extensive search. The bell rung the alarm, and the cry of fire resounded through the streets. It was ascertained(5), however, that it was not fire which caused the alarm, but that the bell tolled the more solemn tidings of a lost child.

6．Every heart sympathized(6) in the sorrows of the distracted parents. Soon, multitudes of the people were seen ascending the hill, upon the declivity(7) of which the village stood, to aid in the search. Ere long, the rain began to fall, but no tidings came back to the village of the lost child. Hardly an eye was that night closed in sleep, and there was not a mother who did not feel for the parents.

7．The night passed away, and the morning dawned, and yet no tidings came. At last, those engaged in the search met together and held a consultation(8). They made arrangements for a more minute search, and agreed that, in case the child was found, a gun should be fired, to give a signal to the rest of the party.

8．As the sun arose, the clouds were scattered, and the whole landscape(9) glittered in the rays of the bright morning. But that village was deserted and still. The stores were closed, and business was hushed. Mothers were walking the streets, with sympathizing countenances and anxious hearts. There was but one thought in every mind: "What has become of the lost child?"

9．All the affections and interest of the neighborhood were flowing in one deep and broad channel toward the little wanderer. About nine in the morning, the signal gun was fired, which announced that the child was found; and, for a moment, how dreadful was the suspense! Was it found a mangled corpse? or was it alive and well?

10．Soon, a joyful shout proclaimed(10) the safety of the child. The shout was borne from tongue to tongue, till the whole forest rang again with the joyful sound. A messenger rapidly bore the tidings to the distracted mother. A procession was immediately formed by those engaged in the search. The child was placed upon a platform, hastily formed from the boughs of trees, and borne in triumph at the head of the procession. When they arrived at the brow of the hill, they rested for a moment, and proclaimed their success with three loud and animated cheers.

11．The procession(11) then moved on till they arrived in front of the dwelling where the parents of the child resided. The mother, who stood at the door, with streaming eyes and throbbing heart, could no longer restrain herself or her feelings.

12．She rushed into the street, clasped her child to her bosom, and wept aloud. Every eye was filled with tears, and, for a moment, all were silent. But suddenly some one gave a signal for a shout. One loud, and long, and happy note of joy rose from the assembled multitude, and they went to their business and their homes.

13．There was more joy over the one child that was found than over the ninety and nine that went not astray. Likewise, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. But still, this is a feeble representation(12) of the love of our Father in heaven for us, and of the joy with which the angels welcome the returning wanderer.

14．The mother can not feel for her child that is lost as God feels for the unhappy wanderer in the paths of sin. If a mother can feel so much, what must be the feelings of our Father in heaven for those who have strayed from his love? If man can feel so deep a sympathy, what must be the emotions which glow in the bosom of angels?

1．几年前，一个孩子在森林里失踪了。他和兄弟姐妹一起去采草莓，不小心和他们走散了。孩子们找了一阵子没有找到，在黄昏的时候赶回家，告诉父母他们的兄弟失踪的消息。

2．当时的森林里有很多熊。那个夜晚天空乌云滚滚，夜幕已经开始降临，得到警报的父亲赶忙召集了几个邻居，匆匆忙忙地去寻找失踪的孩子。妈妈心慌意乱地在家里等消息。

3．乌云开始聚集，天色更黑了，父亲和邻居们非常担心，他们在森林四处寻找着，大声叫着孩子的名字希望孩子能听到。但是没有什么结果，一点蛛丝马迹也没有。他们站在大树下仔细倾听，希望能听到孩子微弱的声音，可是除了风扫过浓密的树枝发出的令人沮丧的呼啸声之外什么也听不到。

4．乌云越聚越多，似乎暴风雨就要降临，漆黑的夜已经包围了他们。很难看出失踪孩子的父亲的心情。谁又能想象，听着呼啸的风声，看着屋外的一片漆黑，想到失踪的孩子，母亲的心里是多么悲伤啊！

5．晚上九点的时候，依然没找到孩子。于是他们派了一个人返回村庄，召集更多的村民进行更彻底地搜索。报警的钟声响了，失火的叫喊声响彻大街。后来证实敲响警钟并不是因为失火，而是因为更严重的消息：一个孩子失踪了。

6．每个人的心中都对失踪孩子父母的痛苦感到同情。村庄就坐落在山坡上，大批人开始爬山，帮助寻找。不久，雨下了起来，但是还没有失踪孩子的消息。那个晚上，几乎没有人睡觉，妈妈们没有不同情失踪孩子父母的。

7．黑夜过去，黎明到来，仍然没有一点消息。最后，搜寻的人聚在一起，商量下一步的行动。他们安排了更仔细的搜寻，并且商量好在找到孩子的时候，向空中放一枪，给其他人报信。

8．太阳升起来，乌云散开了，清晨明亮的光线闪烁着。但是村庄像没有人住一样悄无声息。商店关着门，人们低声说话。走在街上的母亲们，都带着同情的神色，十分焦急。每个人的心里只有一个念头：“失踪孩子怎么样了呢？”

9．邻居们的情感和关注都集中在了失踪的孩子身上。早上大约九点的时候，一声报信的枪声响了，向人们通报孩子找到了。可是，人们仍然十分担心！找到的是孩子的尸身？还是健健康康的孩子？

10．很快，喜悦的喊声传来，孩子是安全的。喊声口口相传，直到整个森林都响起了喜悦的声音。一个报信的人迅速把消息带给心烦意乱的母亲。参与搜寻的人们立刻排成一队。在队伍的最前头，人们胜利地抬着临时用大树枝做成的台子，孩子就在上面。当他们来到坡顶的时候，休息了一会，随着三次热烈的大声欢呼，宣布搜寻工作胜利了。

11．队伍继续向前，最后来到了失踪孩子的家。站在门口的母亲流着泪，心扑通扑通地跳，此时再也无法控制自己的感情了。

12．她冲到街上，把孩子抱在胸前，大声哭了起来。所有人的眼睛也噙着泪水，那一刻非常安静。突然，一个人给出了欢呼的信号。人群中发出了长长的喜悦的欢呼声，人们各自返回工作或家里。

13．找到一个失踪的孩子带给人们的喜悦比九十九个没失踪的更多。同样，当着上帝的天使，一个罪人的忏悔也一样令人喜悦。这确实代表了上帝对我们的爱，以及天使欢迎浪子回头的喜悦。

14．一个母亲对失踪孩子的感受，无法和上帝对犯罪的不幸的浪子产生的感受相比。如果一个母亲能有那么深的感受，那么上帝对于迷失了爱的浪子的情感会是怎样的呢？如果人类有那么深的情感，那么天使的心中洋溢的情感会是怎样的呢？

LESSON 62

WHICH?

把哪个送人


1．Which shall it be? Which shall it be?

I looked at John—John looked at me;

Dear, patient John, who loves me yet

As well as though my locks were jet.

And when I found that I must speak,

My voice seemed strangely low and weak:

"Tell me again what Robert said!"

And then I, listening, bent my head.

"This is his letter:"

2．"'I will give

A house and land while you shall live,

If, in return, from out your seven,

One child to me for aye(1) is given.'"

I looked at John's old garments worn,

I thought of all that John had borne

Of poverty, and work, and care,

Which I, though willing, could not share;

I thought of seven mouths to feed,

Of seven little children's need,

And then of this.

3."Come, John," said I,

"We'll choose among them as they lie

Asleep;" so, walking hand in hand,



Dear John and I surveyed(2) our band.

First to the cradle light we stepped,

Where Lilian the baby slept,

A glory 'gainst the pillow white.

Softly the father stooped to lay

His rough hand down in loving way,

When dream or whisper made her stir,

And huskily he said: "Not her!"

4．We stooped beside the trundle-bed,

And one long ray of lamplight shed

Athwart the boyish faces there,

In sleep so pitiful and fair;

I saw on Jamie's rough, red cheek,

A tear undried. Ere John could speak,

"He's but a baby, too," said I,

And kissed him as we hurried by.

5．Pale, patient Robbie's angel face

Still in his sleep bore suffering's trace:

"No, for a thousand crowns(3), not him,"

He whispered, while our eyes were dim.

6．Poor Dick! bad Dick! our wayward(4) son,

Turbulent(5), reckless, idle one—

Could he be spared? "Nay, He who gave,

Bade us befriend him to the grave;

Only a mother's heart can be

Patient enough for such as he;

And so," said John, "I would not dare

To send him from her bedside prayer."

7．Then stole we softly up above

And knelt by Mary, child of love.

"Perhaps for her 't would better be,"

I said to John. Quite silently

He lifted up a curl that lay

Across her cheek in willful way,

And shook his head. "Nay, love, not thee,"

The while my heart beat audibly.

8．Only one more, our eldest lad,

Trusty and truthful, good and glad—

So like his father. "No, John, no—

I can not, will not let him go."

9．And so we wrote in courteous(6) way,

We could not drive one child away.

And afterward, toil lighter seemed,

Thinking of that of which we dreamed;

Happy, in truth, that not one face

We missed from its accustomed(7) place;

Thankful to work for all the seven,

Trusting the rest to One in heaven!



(Mrs. E. L. Beers)

1．选哪一个？选哪一个？

我看着约翰

约翰正看着我；

他对我的爱

像我头发的颜色那么黑。

当我发现我不得不说话时，

我的声音奇怪而微弱：

“再说说罗伯特说了什么！”

我听着，低垂着头。

“这是他的来信：”

2．“‘我会给你

一所房子、一块地，让你们过下去

条件是把你们七个孩子中的一个，

永远过继给我。’”

看着约翰的旧大衣，

想着约翰受的苦

贫穷、辛苦、生活的重担，

我无法分担，虽然愿意；

想着七张等饭吃的嘴，

七个孩子的生活需要，

然后想着这封信。

3．“来吧，约翰，”我说，

“趁他们睡着，我们挑选一个；”

手牵着手，

亲爱的约翰和我

先来到摇篮边，

莉莲熟睡着，

头枕在白色的枕头上。

父亲弯下腰

把粗糙的手放在孩子身上，

梦中的她轻轻动了动，

爸爸嗓音嘶哑：

“不要把她送人！”

4．我们站在小床边，

油灯的光照在男孩子脸上，

梦中的他们如此让人怜爱；

杰米红红的脸蛋还挂着，

一滴泪水。没等约翰说话，

我已说了出来，“他还是婴儿，”

亲了他一下，我们继续向前走。

5．天使般的罗比依旧生着病，脸色苍白，

熟睡中还显得痛苦：

“一千克郎也不行，也不能送走他，”

他低声说，我们双眼湿润。

6．可怜的迪克！坏坏的迪克，任性的孩子，

淘气、毛手毛脚，又懒散——

把他送走吗？

不，把他托付给我们的人，

叮嘱我们永远好好待他；

只有母亲才能对他耐心；

“因此，”约翰说，“我不敢

让他离开妈妈身边。”

7．我们悄悄来到

玛丽的床边，我们的最爱。

“最好别送走她，”

我对约翰说。他轻轻

捋起她面颊上俏丽的卷发，

“不是她，亲爱的，”

我听到了自己的心跳声。

8．只剩一个了，我们的大孩子，

让人信赖、性格真诚、脾气温和、讨人喜爱

和他的父亲一样。“不，约翰，不——

我不能送走他，也不想送走他。”

9．我们礼貌地回了信，

我们不能把任何一个孩子给他。

此后，劳动似乎也不显劳累，

因为心中充满了憧憬；

我们没有让任何一个孩子

离开熟悉的地方；

为了七个孩子工作，心存感激，

我们把自己托付给天上的主！

LESSON 63

THE PET FAWN

小宠物鹿


1．A pretty little fawn(1) had been brought in from the woods, when very young, and nursed and petted by a lady in the village until it had become as tame as possible. It was graceful, as those little creatures always are, and so gentle and playful that it became a great favorite, following the different members of the family about, being caressed(2) by the neighbors, and welcome everywhere.

2．One morning, after playing about as usual until weary, it lay down in the sunshine, at the feet of one of its friends, upon the steps of a store. There came along a countryman, who for several years had been a hunter by pursuit, and who still kept several hounds, one of which was now with him.

3．The dog, as it approached the spot where the fawn lay, suddenly stopped. The little animal saw him, and started to its feet. It had lived more than half its life among the dogs of the village, and had apparently lost all fear of them; but it seemed now to know that an enemy was near. In an instant, its whole nature seemed changed; all its past habits were forgotten; every wild impulse was awake; its head erect, its nostrils dilated(3), its eyes flashing.

4．In another instant, before the spectators(4) had thought of the danger, and before its friends could secure it, the fawn was bounding away through the street, and the hound in full chase. The bystanders were eager to save it; several persons immediately followed its track; the friends who had long fed and fondled it, calling the name it had hitherto known, in vain.

5．The hunter endeavored to whistle back his dog, but with no success. In half a minute the fawn had turned the first corner, dashed onward toward the lake, and thrown itself into the water. But if for a moment the startled creature believed itself safe in the cool bosom of the lake, it was soon undeceived; for the hound followed in hot and eager chase, while a dozen village dogs joined blindly in the pursuit.

6．A large crowd collected on the bank—men, women, and children—anxious for the fate of the little animal so well known to them all. Some threw themselves into boats, hoping to intercept(5) the hound before he reached his prey. The plashing of the oars, the eager voices of men and boys, and the barking of the dogs, must have filled the heart of the poor fawn with terror and anguish,—as though every creature on the spot where it had once been caressed and fondled, had suddenly turned into a deadly foe.

7．It was soon seen that the little animal was directing its course across a bay toward the nearest borders of the forest. Immediately the owner of the hound crossed the bridge, and ran at full speed, hoping to stop his dog as he landed. On swam the fawn, as it never swam before; its delicate head scarcely seen above the water, but leaving a disturbed track, which betrayed(6) its course alike to its friends and foes.

8．As it approached the land, the interest became intense(7). The hunter was already on the same side of the lake, calling loudly and angrily to his dog; but the hound seemed to have quite forgotten his master's voice in the pitiless pursuit. The fawn reached the shore. With a leap it had crossed the narrow strip of beach, and in another instant it would reach the cover of the woods.

9．The hound followed true to the scent(8), pointing to the same spot on the shore; his master, anxious to meet him, had run at full speed, and was now coming up at the same critical moment. Will the dog listen to his voice? or can the hunter reach him in time to seize and control him? A shout from the bank told that the fawn had passed out of sight into the forest. At the same instant, the hound, as he touched the land, felt the hunter's strong arm clutching his neck. The worst was believed to be over; the fawn was leaping up the mountain side, and its enemy was restrained. The other dogs, seeing their leader cowed(9), were easily managed.

10．A number of persons, men and boys, dispersed themselves through the woods in search of the little creature, but without success; they all returned to the village, reporting that the fawn had not been seen. Some thought that after its fright had passed it would return of its own accord. It wore a pretty collar with its owner's name engraved upon it, so that it could be easily known from any other fawn that might be straying about the woods.

11．Before many hours had passed, a hunter presented himself to the lady whose pet the little creature had been, and showed a collar with her name upon it. He said that he was out hunting in the morning, and saw a fawn in the distance. The little pet, instead of bounding away, as he expected, moved toward him; he took aim, fired, and shot it through the heart.





【中文阅读】


1．有一只可爱的小鹿，还很小的时候，就被人从森林里带了回来，由村里的一位太太收养，因此非常温顺。像别的小动物一样，小鹿举止优美，也非常温和、爱玩，没有人不喜欢它，它跟着家人到处走，邻居们也都喜欢抚摩它，它甭提多受欢迎了。

2．一天上午，小鹿像往常一样玩耍，累了就躺在商店的台阶上，趴在一个朋友的脚下晒太阳。这时来了一个乡下人，他多年来一直以打猎为业，养了好几只猎犬，现在就带了一只在身边。

3．猎犬走近小鹿，突然停了下来。小鹿看到它，站了起来。小鹿有一半时间都和村中的狗在一起，显然不惧怕它们；可是现在它似乎意识到敌人在附近。瞬间，小鹿的整个性格似乎都变了；它完全忘记了过去的习性；野性的冲动苏醒了；它抬起头，鼻孔翕张，眼睛放光。

4．又一个瞬间，谁也没想到可能发生的危险，出乎小鹿的朋友们的意料，它已经跳跃着冲过大街，猎犬紧追不舍。人们急着营救它，几个人立即跟了上去。一直喂养爱抚小鹿的朋友们，开始喊叫它的名字，可是一点都没有用。

5．猎人吹着口哨试图唤回猎犬，可是没成功。半分钟后小鹿已经拐过第一个街角，冲到湖边，跃入水中。刚开始，受惊的小鹿还以为在凉爽的湖水中已经安全了，可是它很快醒悟过来；猎犬紧紧尾随着，十几只狗也盲目地一起追赶。

6．湖岸已经聚集了一大群人——男人、女人和孩子们——为他们熟悉的小鹿的命运担着心。一些人冲上船，希望在猎犬追上小鹿之前拦住它。船桨摇动水花四溅的声音，男人和男孩子们急切的叫喊声和汪汪的狗叫声，肯定已经让可怜的小鹿心中充满了恐惧和痛苦——仿佛在那块土地上曾经爱抚过它的所有人都成了它的死敌。

7．很快人们看到小鹿横过河湾朝森林的方向游去。猎犬的主人迅速过了桥，全速奔跑着，希望在猎犬上岸时拦住它。小鹿继续向前游，使出了平生的力气；尽管几乎看不到小鹿的头，但所过之处在水面上留下了痕迹，暴露了自己的路线。

8．当小鹿接近陆地的时候，人们变得极其紧张。猎人已经在湖的另一侧，愤怒地大声呼叫他的猎犬；可是猎犬在无情的追逐中似乎忘记了主人的声音。小鹿上岸了，它一跃跃过狭窄的河滩，它马上就要到森林了。

9．猎犬紧跟着小鹿的气味，朝河滩上的小鹿奔去；猎犬的主人急于拦住它，全速奔跑着，也在这关键时刻追到了。猎犬会听他的招呼吗？猎人会及时赶上控制住他的猎犬吗？岸上有人喊，小鹿已经跑进森林，踪迹不见了。同一时刻，猎犬一踏上陆地就被主人强有力的手臂掐住了脖子。最可怕的事情终于没有发生；小鹿顺着山坡向上跳跃，它的敌人受到了控制。别的狗看到领头的被制服了，也都乖乖的了。

10．一些人分头进入森林寻找小鹿，但是没找到；他们返回村里，报告说没找到小鹿。人们想小鹿自己会回来的。小鹿戴着漂亮的项圈，上面刻着主人的名字，很容易识别。

11．过了些天，一个猎人来到了曾经喂养小鹿的太太那里，出示了一个项圈，上面刻着她的名字。他说，早上去打猎，远远看到一只小鹿。他以为小鹿会离开，没想到却朝他走了过来；他瞄准，开枪，射穿了小鹿的心脏。

LESSON 64

ANNIE'S DREAM

安妮的梦


1．It was a clear, cold, winter evening, and all the Sinclairs but Annie had gone out for a neighborly visit. She had resolved to stay at home and study a long, difficult lesson in Natural(1) Philosophy.

2．Left to herself, the evening passed quickly, but the lesson was learned a full half hour before the time set for the family to come home.

3．Closing her book, she leaned back in the soft armchair in which she was sitting, soon fell asleep, and began to dream. She dreamed that it was a very cold morning, and that she was standing by the dining-room stove, looking into the glass basin which was every day filled with water for evaporation(2).

4．"Oh, dear," she sighed, "it is nearly school time. I don't want to go out in the cold this morning. Then there is that long lesson. I wonder if I can say it. Let me see—it takes two hundred and twelve degrees(3) of heat, I believe, for water to evaporate—"

5．"Nonsense!" "Ridiculous!" shouted a chorus of strange little voices near by; "Look here! is this water boiling? What an idea; two hundred and twelve degrees before we can fly, ha, ha!"

6．"Who are you?" asked Annie, in amazement. "Where must I look?" "In the basin, of course."

7．Annie looked, and saw a multitude of tiny forms moving swiftly around, their numbers increasing as the heat of the fire increased. "Why, you dear little things!" said she, "what are you doing down there?"

8．"We are water sprites(4)," answered one, in the clearest voice that can be imagined, "and when this delightful warmth comes all about us, we become so light that we fly off, as you see."

9．In another moment he had joined a crowd of his companions that were spreading their wings and flying off in curling, white clouds over Annie's head. But they were so light and thin that they soon disappeared in the air.

10．She could not see where they went, so she again turned to the basin. "Does n't it hurt you," she asked one, "to be heated—?" "Not always to two hundred and twelve," said the sprite, mischievously(5).

11．"No, no," replied Annie, half-vexed; "I remember, that is boiling point—but I mean, to be heated as you all are, and then to fly off in the cold?"

12．"Oh, no," laughed the little sprite; "we like it. We are made to change by God's wise laws, and so it can't hurt us. We are all the time at work, in our way, taking different shapes. It is good for us. If you will go to the window, you will find some of my brothers and sisters on the glass."

13．Annie went to the window, and at first could see nothing but some beautiful frostwork on it. Soon, however, the panes seemed to swarm(6) with little folks. Their wings were as white as snow, and sparkled with ice jewels.

14．"Oh," cried Annie, "this is the prettiest sight I ever saw. What is your name, darling?" she asked one that wore a crown of snow roses. The little voice that replied was so sharp and fine that Annie thought it seemed like a needle point of sound, and she began to laugh.

15．"Fine Frost is our family name," it said. "I have a first name of my own, but I shall not tell you what it is, for you are so impolite as to laugh at me."

16．"I beg your pardon, dear," said Annie; "I could not help it. I will not laugh at you any more if you will tell me how you came here. I have been talking with one of your brothers over there in the basin."

17．The little sprite then folded her wings in a dignified manner, and said, "I will tell you all I know about it, since you promise to be polite. It is a very short story, however.

18．"Last evening we all escaped(7) from the glass basin, as you have seen our companions do this morning. Oh, how light and free we felt! But we were so very delicate and thin that no one saw us as we flew about in the air of the room.

19．"After a while I flew with these others to this window, and, as we alighted on the glass, the cold changed us from water sprites into sprites of the Fine Frost family." "It is very wonderful," said Annie. "Is it nice to be a sprite?"

20．"Oh, yes, we are very gay. All last night we had a fine time sparkling in the moonlight. I wore a long wreath full of ice pearls and diamonds. Here is a piece of it. Before long we shall be water sprites again. I see the sun is coming this way."

21．"Shall you dread to be melted?" inquired Annie. "No, indeed," answered the sprite. "I like to change my form now and then."

22．A thought flashed across Annie's brain. What if she should breathe on the frost and not wait for the sun to melt it. In a moment more she had done so. Down fell a great number of the tiny mountains and castles, carrying with them a multitude of frost sprites, and all that could be seen was a drop of water on the window sill.

23．"Oh, dear! have I hurt them?" she exclaimed. "No, no," replied a chorus of many small voices from the drop of water, "we are only water sprites again. Nothing hurts us; we merely change." "But you are always pretty little things," said Annie. "I wish—"

24．Here a ring at the doorbell woke Annie. She started up to find the family had returned from their visit, which all declared was a delightful one. But Annie said she did not believe they had enjoyed their visit better than she had her half hour's dream.





【中文阅读】


1．这是一个清澈寒冷的冬夜，辛克莱一家除安妮外都去邻居家做客去了。她决心待在家里学习一节又长又难的自然哲学课程。

2．一个人留在家里，夜晚过得很快，课程已经学完了，可是距离家人回来还有整整半个小时。

3．合上书，她坐在柔软的扶手椅里，向后靠着，很快就睡着了，她开始做起了梦。她梦到一个寒冷的早晨，她站在餐厅的炉子旁边，向玻璃水盆里面看，水盆里每天都装满水，水蒸发后可以增加室内的湿度。

4．“噢，天哪，”她叹了口气，“上学时间快到了。这么冷，我真不愿意出门。还有那节长长的课程。我想知道，我可不可以说——让我考虑一下——我相信水在212度时蒸发——”

5．“胡说！”“荒谬！”一道奇怪的很小的声音齐声喊道；“朝这儿看！水沸腾了吗？真是怪念头；212度后我们才会飞，哈，哈！”

6．“你们是谁？”安妮惊讶地问道，“我得朝哪儿看？”“当然朝水盆里。”

7．安妮看过去，只见无数微小的身形在水盆里敏捷地移动着，随着炉火越来越热，他们数量也不断增加。“原来是你们这些可爱的小东西！”她说，“你们在那儿做什么呢？”

8．“我们是水精灵，”一个身形回答，声音很清楚，“当讨人喜欢的温暖包围我们的时候，我们就轻得能够飞走了，你能看到的。”

9．一瞬间，他加入了一群伙伴中，张开翅膀，像白色的云，从安妮的头顶上，盘旋着飞走了。可是他们是那么轻那么薄，很快就消失在空气中了。

10．她看不到他们去了哪里，因此她又转向水盆。“不会伤到你们吗，”她问他们当中的一个，“加热到——？”“不总是212度(8)，”水精灵顽皮地说。

11．“不，不，”安妮有点恼怒的回答道，“我记得那是沸点——可是我的意思是，你们都被加热，然后飞进冷空气里？”

12．“噢，不，”小精灵笑着答道，“我们很喜欢。上帝的智慧法则让我们变化，因此不会伤害我们。我们一直在工作，用我们的方式，变成不同的形状。这对我们有好处。如果你愿意去窗户那儿，在玻璃上，你会看到我们的一些兄弟姐妹。”

13．安妮走到窗户那儿，开始只看到玻璃上美丽的霜花。可是，很快，窗玻璃上好像挤满了小家伙。他们的翅膀和雪一样白，像冰宝石一样闪闪发光。

14．“噢，”安妮叫了起来，“这是我见过的最美的景象。亲爱的，你叫什么名字？”她问其中戴着玫瑰王冠的一个。回答的声音又尖又细，安妮想这有点像针眼的声音，于是开始笑了起来。

15．“霜是我们的姓，”它说，“我有自己的名字，可是我不告诉你是什么，因为你没有礼貌，笑话我。”

16．“请原谅我，亲爱的，”安妮说，“我忍不住。如果你告诉我你是怎么来这里的，我就不笑你了。我刚才一直在和那边水盆里你的一个兄弟谈话呢。”

17．这个小精灵叠起翅膀，神态显得很高贵，说道：“我告诉你我知道的一切，因为你答应有礼貌。可这只是个很短的故事。

18．“昨晚我们都从玻璃盆里逃了出来，就像你今天早上看到的我们的伙伴那样。噢，我们是多么轻，多么自由啊！可是我们这么纤弱，这么薄，我们在房间的空气中飞来飞去谁也看不到我们。

19．“过了一会，我和别人一起飞到窗户这儿，当我们在玻璃上排好队的时候，寒冷把我们从水精灵变成了霜家族的精灵。”“太奇妙了，”安妮说，“做精灵好吗？”

20．“噢，好，我们很开心。昨天整晚我们在月光下闪耀，过得快乐极了。我戴着长长的镶满冰珍珠和钻石的花环。这是其中一颗。我们不久就会重新变成水精灵。我看到太阳朝这边来了。”

21．“你害怕融化吗？”安妮问道。“不，实际上，”小精灵回答道，“我愿意不时换换体形。”

22．一个念头掠过安妮的大脑。要是在霜上呼气，不等太阳融化它会怎么样。不一会，她果然这么做了。大量微小的山脉和城堡坍塌了，带着大量的霜精灵，窗玻璃上只看到一滴水。

23．“噢，天哪！我伤到你们了吗？”她惊叫道。“没有，没有，”水滴中很多小的声音齐声回答，“我们又变成水精灵了。什么也不能伤害我们，我们只是变化了体形。”“可是你们永远是可爱的小精灵，”安妮说，“我希望——”

24．这时门铃声唤醒了梦中的安妮。家人已经做客回来了，他们都说过得很开心。可是安妮说她不信他们过得比她半小时的梦还快乐。

LESSON 65

MY GHOST

我见到的鬼


By Mrs. S. M. B. Piatt, who was born near Lexington, Ky., in 1836. Among her published works may be mentioned "The Nests at Washington, and Other Poems," and "A Woman's Poems."

1．Yes, Katie, I think you are very sweet,

Now that the tangles are out of your hair,

And you sing as well as the birds you meet,

That are playing, like you, in the blossoms there.

But now you are coming to kiss me, you say:

Well, what is it for? Shall I tie your shoe?

Or loop up your sleeve in a prettier way?

"Do I know about ghosts?" Indeed I do.

2．"Have I seen one?" Yes; last evening, you know,

We were taking a walk that you had to miss,

(I think you were naughty, and cried to go,

But, surely, you'll stay at home after this!)

And, away in the twilight, lonesomely,

("What is the twilight?" It's—getting late!)

I was thinking of things that were sad to me!—

There, hush! you know nothing about them, Kate.

3．Well, we had to go through the rocky lane,

Close to that bridge where the water roars,

By a still, red house, where the dark and rain

Go in when they will at the open doors.

And the moon, that had just waked up, looked through

The broken old windows, and seemed afraid,

And the wild bats flew, and the thistles grew

Where once in the roses the children played.

4．Just across the road by the cherry trees

Some fallen white stones had been lying so long,

Half hid in the grass, and under these

There were people dead. I could hear the song

Of a very sleepy dove as I passed

The graveyard near, and the cricket that cried;

And I look'd (ah! the Ghost is coming at last!)

And something was walking at my side.

5．It seemed to be wrapped in a great dark shawl

(For the night was a little cold, you know,);

It would not speak. It was black and tall;

And it walked so proudly and very slow.

Then it mocked me everything I could do:

Now it caught at the lightning flies like me;

Now it stopped where the elder blossoms grew;

Now it tore the thorns from a gray bent tree.

6．Still it followed me under the yellow moon,

Looking back to the graveyard now and then,

Where the winds were playing the night a tune—

But, Kate, a Ghost doesn't care for men,

And your papa could n't have done it harm.

Ah! dark-eyed darling, what is it you see?

There, you needn't hide in your dimpled arm—

It was only my shadow that walk'd with me!





【中文阅读】


S. M. 皮亚特夫人，1836年生于肯塔基州莱克星顿附近。他发表的作品包括《华盛顿的巢和其他诗歌》和《一个女人的诗》。

1．是的凯蒂，你今天真可爱，

头发也不乱了，

歌也唱得像鸟一样好听，

鸟儿和你一样喜欢在花丛中玩耍，

现在你过来亲我，你说：

要我帮你系鞋带吗？

还是把袖口挽得漂亮些？

“你知道鬼吗？”我当然知道。

2．“我见过吗？”是的，就在昨晚，

我们去散步，你没能去，

（你可真淘气，哭着要去。

等我说完了，你就再不想去了。）

黄昏的光线很暗，我心情孤独。

（黄昏是什么？就是天晚了。）

心中思量着我的伤心事，

安静，你还不懂呢，凯蒂。

3．散步必须经过石径，靠近小桥，

桥下的水声咆哮个不停，

那个安静的红房子敞着房门，

雨水落进门里，门里黑漆漆的。

月光刚睡醒照进窗子，

看起来好恐怖。

蝙蝠吱吱叫着从蓟草里飞起，

那里曾经是孩子们喜爱的玫瑰花丛。

4．路旁的果树下面乱草丛生，

草里埋着乱石，曾经有人死在那里，

经过墓地旁边的时候，我听到鸽子在唱，

蛐蛐也在叫；当我抬头看，

看啊，（就要说到鬼了。）

好像什么人走在我身边。

5．他披着黑色的斗篷，

（你知道夜里有点冷）；

走路很缓慢，个子又高大，

不说一句话，只是高傲而缓慢地走着。

模仿着我的每个动作，

我抓萤火虫，他也伸手去抓，

我停在花旁，他也停在那儿，

我去折树枝，他也和我学。

6．黄色的月光下，它一直跟着我，

不时转身朝那墓地看，

夜里风呜咽着，

可是凯蒂，鬼可不会在意。

你爸爸可没招惹过他？

黑眼小可爱，你看到什么了？

你不用藏在我胳肢窝里，

那不过是我的影子罢了！





LESSON 66

THE ELEPHANT

大　象


1．The elephant is the largest of quadrupeds(1); his height is from eight to fourteen feet, and his length, from ten to fifteen feet. His form is that of a hog; his eyes are small and lively; his ears are long, broad and pendulous(2). He has two large tusks, which form the ivory of commerce(3), and a trunk, or proboscis(4), at the end of the nose, which he uses to take his food with, and for attack or defense. His color is a dark ash-brown.

2．Elephants often assemble in large troops; and, as they march in search of food, the forests seem to tremble under them. They eat the branches of trees, together with roots, herbs, leaves, grain, and fruit, but will not touch fish nor flesh. In a state of nature, they are peaceable, mild, and brave; exerting their power only for their own protection or in defense of their own species.

3．Elephants are found both in Asia and Africa, but they are of different species, the Asiatic elephant having five toes, and the African, three. These animals are caught by stratagem(5), and, when tamed, they are the most gentle, obedient, and patient, as well as the most docile(6) and sagacious of all quadrupeds. They are used to carry burdens, and for traveling. Their attachment to their masters is remarkable; and they seem to live but to serve and obey them. They always kneel to receive their riders or the loads they have to carry.

4．The anecdotes illustrating the character of the elephant are numerous. An elephant which was kept for exhibition at London, was often required, as is usual in such exhibitions, to pick up with his trunk a piece of money thrown upon the floor for this purpose. On one occasion a sixpence was thrown, which happened to roll a little out of his reach, not far from the wall. Being desired to pick it up, he stretched out his proboscis several times to reach it; failing in this, he stood motionless a few seconds, evidently considering how to act.

5．He then stretched his proboscis in a straight line as far as he could, a little distance above the coin, and blew with great force against the wall. The angle produced by the opposition of the wall, made the current of air act under the coin, as he evidently supposed it would, and it was curious to observe the sixpence traveling toward the animal till it came within his reach, when he picked it up.

6．A soldier in India, who had frequently carried an elephant some arrack(7), being one day intoxicated, and seeing himself pursued by the guard whose orders were to conduct him to prison, took refuge under the elephant. The guard soon finding his retreat, attempted in vain to take him from his asylum(8); for the elephant vigorously defended him with his trunk.

7．As soon as the soldier became sober, and saw himself placed under such an unwieldy(9) animal, he was so terrified that he scarcely durst move either hand or foot; but the elephant soon caused his fears to subside by caressing him with his trunk, and thus tacitly(10) saying, "Depart in peace."

8．A pleasing anecdote is related of an elephant which was the property of the nabob(11) of Lucknow. There was in that city an epidemic(12) disorder, making dreadful havoc among the inhabitants. The road to the palace gate was covered with the sick and dying, lying on the ground at the moment the nabob was about to pass.

9．Regardless of the suffering he must cause, the nabob held on his way, not caring whether his beast trod upon the poor helpless creatures or not. But the animal, more kind-hearted than his master, carefully cleared the path of the poor, helpless wretches as he went along. Some he lifted with his trunk, entirely out of the road. Some he set upon their feet, and among the others he stepped so carefully that not an individual was injured.





【中文阅读】


1．大象是四蹄动物当中最大的；高八到十四英尺，长十到十五英尺。大象的外形有点像猪；眼睛小而生动；耳朵又长又宽，向下耷拉着。它有两颗大牙，因此形成了象牙贸易，大象用长鼻取得食物、攻击和防卫。大象的牙是深灰褐色的。

2．大象经常成群聚集在一起；大象觅食走过时，似乎把森林踩在脚下。大象吃树枝、草根、草药、树叶、谷物和水果，但从不吃鱼和肉。大象爱好和平，性格温和而勇敢；只有保护自己或族群时才施展自己的威力。

3．尽管在亚洲和非洲都有大象，但是它们的种类不同，亚洲象有五个趾头，非洲象只有三个趾头。捕捉大象需要施展些手段才行，可是驯服后，大象是最温和、最顺从、最有耐心的动物，也是四蹄动物中最聪明的。大象被用来驮重物和骑行。大象对主人感情很深，它们的生活似乎就是为主人服务。它们总是跪着让主人骑上去，或者等人们把货物放到身上。

4．很多故事都描绘了大象的性格。在伦敦展览的一只大象常常被要求用长鼻拾起扔在地上的钱币，就像展览中经常做的那样。有一次，一枚六便士的硬币被扔到地上后，碰巧滚到离墙很近的一个地方。大象的长鼻伸出去几次都够不到，大象一动不动站了几分钟，显然在考虑该怎么办。

5．这时大象尽可能在硬币的上方伸直长鼻，用力向墙上吹气。吹出的气流受到墙的阻挡，作用在硬币下方，好像计算好了似的，人们惊讶地发现硬币移动到了大象能够到的位置，这时大象拾起了硬币。

6．一个印度士兵经常用大象运送酒，有一天他喝醉了，一个卫兵追了过来，一旦被抓住，就要被关进监狱，这个印度士兵藏在了大象的身体下面。卫兵虽然很快找到了他，却没有办法抓到他，因为大象用长鼻奋力保护他。

7．一清醒过来，看到自己钻到这个庞然大物的身下，士兵吓坏了，手脚都不敢移动；可是大象很快打消了他的恐惧，用鼻子抚摩着他，似乎在说，“放心离开吧。”

8．还有一个人们喜闻乐见的故事，一位印度王子有一头不同寻常的大象。在那个城市正流行传染病，大部分居民受到了感染。当王子要经过王宫大门的时候，道路上到处躺着生病和垂死的人。

9．王子骑着象继续赶路，毫不顾及会不会踩到人，也不管会带来多大的痛苦。可是大象比它的主人善良，一边走一边小心地清理道路，移开那些可怜的、无助的、不幸的人。它用鼻子把一些人挪到路边，又使另外一些人站起来。小心翼翼地走在余下的人中间，没伤到一个人。

LESSON 67

DARE TO DO RIGHT

道德勇气


Adapted from "School Days at Rugby(1)," by Thomas Hughes, an English writer well known through this book, and its sequel, "Tom Brown at Oxford." The author was born in 1823, and died in 1896.



1．The little schoolboys went quietly to their own beds, and began undressing and talking to one another in whispers: while the elder, amongst whom was Tom, sat chatting about on one another's beds, with their jackets and waistcoats(2) off.

2．Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed(3) with the novelty(4) of his position. The idea of sleeping in the room with strange boys had clearly never crossed his mind before, and was as painful as it was strange to him. He could hardly bear to take his jacket off; however, presently, with an effort, off it came, and then he paused and looked at Tom, who was sitting at the bottom of his bed, talking and laughing.

3．"Please, Brown," he whispered, "may I wash my face and hands?" "Of course, if you like," said Tom, staring: "that's your wash-hand stand under the window, second from your bed. You'll have to go down for more water in the morning if you use it all."

4．And on he went with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly from between the beds out to his wash-hand stand, and began his ablutions(5), thereby drawing for a moment on himself the attention of the room.

5．On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his washing and undressing, and put on his nightgown. He then looked round more nervously than ever. Two or three of the little boys were already in bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The light burned clear, the noise went on.

6．It was a trying moment for the poor, little, lonely boy; however, this time he did not ask Tom what he might or might not do, but dropped on his knees by his bedside, as he had done every day from his childhood, to open his heart to Him who heareth the cry and beareth the sorrows of the tender child, and the strong man in agony.

7．Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his boots, so that his back was towards Arthur, and he did not see what had happened, and looked up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three boys laughed and sneered(6), and a big, brutal fellow, who was standing in the middle of the room, picked up a slipper and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling him a sniveling young shaver.

8．Then Tom saw the whole, and the next moment the boot he had just pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully(7), who had just time to throw up his arm and catch it on his elbow. "Confound you, Brown; what's that for?" roared he, stamping with pain. "Never mind what I mean," said Tom, stepping on to the floor, every drop of blood in his body tingling(8): "if any fellow wants the other boot, he knows how to get it."

9．What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment the sixth-form boy(9) came in, and not another word could be said. Tom and the rest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there, and the old janitor had put out the candle in another minute, and toddled on to the next room, shutting the door with his usual, "Good night, gen'l'm'n."

10．There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was taken to heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow of poor Tom. For some time his excitement and the flood of memories which chased one another though his brain, kept him from thinking or resolving. His head throbbed, his heart leapt, and he could hardly keep himself from springing out of bed and rushing about the room.

11．Then the thought of his own mother came across him, and the promise he had made at her knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by his bedside and give himself up to his Father before he laid his head on the pillow, from which it might never rise; and he lay down gently, and cried as if his heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.





EXERCISES.—What were Arthur's feelings the first night at Rugby? Relate what happened when he said his prayers. What do you think of the boy who threw the slipper? Was Tom right in defending Arthur from insult?

改写自托马斯·休斯的《在拉格比学校的日子》，作者以本书及其续集《汤姆·布朗在牛津》闻名。作者生于1823年，于1896年逝世。



1．小孩子们悄悄地上了床，开始脱下衣服，说悄悄话；大点的孩子们，包括汤姆，脱了外衣和马甲，坐在床上交谈着。

2．新环境使可怜的小阿瑟感到不安。以前他从来没想过要和陌生的男孩子们睡在一个房间，因此既陌生，又痛苦。他很难忍受脱下外衣；可是很快，一咬牙还是脱了下来，然后停了一下，看了看汤姆，汤姆正坐在床脚，有说有笑的。

3．“请问，汤姆，”他低声说，“我可以洗洗脸和手吗？”“当然，要是你愿意，”汤姆盯着他说，“窗子下面是你的洗手架，从你床边数第二个。如果你把水用光，明天早上你就得多打些水。”

4．汤姆继续和别人说话，阿瑟羞怯地从床的间隙中走到洗手架，洗了起来，也吸引了房间里其他人的目光。

5．房间里依然有说有笑。阿瑟洗完后，脱了衣服，穿上了睡衣。看着四周，他这时显得更紧张了。两三个小孩子已经膝盖顶着下巴坐在床上。烛光明亮，房间里依然乱哄哄的。

6．对可怜的小阿瑟来说，这可是一个考验他的时刻；可是，这次他没有问汤姆可以或不可以，他双腿跪在了床边，就像他自孩提时开始每天做的那样，向聆听世人的恳求、为弱小的孩子和成年人承受苦恼和痛苦的主敞开了心扉。

7．汤姆正坐在床脚解鞋带，背对着阿瑟，没有看到发生的一切，房间里突然的安静使他惊讶地抬起了头。这时两三个男孩儿大声取笑讥讽小阿瑟，站在房子中间的一个高大野蛮的家伙拾起一只拖鞋，掷向跪拜的男孩，把他称作哭啼啼的小教徒。

8．汤姆看到了发生的一切，刚脱下的靴子笔直地飞向了那个恶棍的头，那个野蛮的家伙连忙伸手去接，正好打在肘部。“你疯了，布朗；你干什么？”他大声叫起来，疼得直跺脚。“别管我什么意思，”汤姆说着，站到了地上，身上的每滴血都沸腾了：“如果谁想要另一个靴子，他知道应该怎么做。”

9．可能发生什么谁也无法知道，因为这时，六年级男孩走了进来，大家都不作声了。汤姆和别的孩子们匆忙上了床，脱去衣服，一分钟后老舍监熄了蜡烛，走向另一个房间，像往常一样关了门，说了声“晚安，先生们。”

10．刚发生的小插曲让房间里很多男孩睡前在心里思量起来。可怜的汤姆一点也不瞌睡。兴奋和刚发生的场面在头脑中相互追逐着，使他无法思考和分析。他的头痛得厉害，心跳个不停，强忍住才没从床上跳起来，在房间里奔跑。

11．他想起了母亲，想起了几年前在她的膝前自己的承诺，一定要把自己交给上帝，然后才能把头放到枕头上，因为一觉之后可能就再也醒不过来了；他轻轻躺下，哭泣起来，好像心都要碎了。他才十四岁呀。

LESSON 68

DARE TO DO RIGHT (CONCLUDED)

道德勇气（结束篇）


1．It was no light act of courage in those days for a little fellow to say his prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A few years later, when Arnold's(1) manly piety had begun to leaven(2) the school, the tables turned: before he died, in the Schoolhouse at least, and I believe in the other houses, the rule was the other way.

2．But poor Tom had come to school in other times. The first few nights after he came he did not kneel down because of the noise, but sat up in bed till the candle was out, and then stole out and said his prayers, in fear lest some one should find him out. So did many another poor little fellow.

3．Then he began to think that he might just as well say his prayers in bed, and then that it did not matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting, or lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as with all who will not confess their Lord before men; and for the last year he had probably not said his prayers in earnest a dozen times.

4．Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling, which was like to break his heart, was the sense of his own cowardice. The vice of all others which he loathed(3) was brought in and burned in on his own soul. He had lied to his mother, to his conscience, to his God. How could he bear it? And then the poor, little, weak boy, whom he had pitied and almost scorned for his weakness, had done that which he, braggart(4) as he was, dared not do.

5．The first dawn of comfort came to him in vowing(5) to himself that he would stand by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer him, and help him, and bear his burdens, for the good deed done that night. Then he resolved to write home next day and tell his mother all, and what a coward her son had been. And then peace came to him as he resolved, lastly, to bear his testimony(6) next morning.

6．The morning would be harder than the night to begin with, but he felt that he could not afford to let one chance slip. Several times he faltered(7), for the Devil showed him, first, all his old friends calling him "Saint," and "Squaretoes," and a dozen hard names, and whispered to him that his motives(8) would be misunderstood, and he would be left alone with the new boy; whereas, it was his duty to keep all means of influence, that he might do good to the largest number.

7．And then came the more subtle(9) temptation, "shall I not be showing myself braver than others by doing this? Have I any right to begin it now? Ought I not rather to pray in my own study(10), letting other boys know that I do so, and trying to lead them to it, while in public, at least, I should go on as I have done?" However, his good angel was too strong that night, and he turned on his side and slept, tired of trying to reason, but resolved to follow the impulse which had been so strong, and in which he had found peace.

8．Next morning he was up and washed and dressed, all but his jacket and waistcoat, just as the ten minutes' bell began to ring, and then in the face of the whole room he knelt down to pray. Not five words could he say,—the bell mocked him; he was listening for every whisper in the room,—what were they all thinking of him?

9．He was ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise from his knees. At last, as it were from his inmost heart, a still, small voice seemed to breathe forth the words of the publican, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" He repeated them over and over, clinging to them as for his life, and rose from his knees comforted and humbled, and ready to face the whole world.

10．It was not needed: two other boys besides Arthur had already followed his example, and he went down to the great school with a glimmering(11) of another lesson in his heart,—the lesson that he who has conquered his own coward spirit has conquered the whole outward world; and that other one which the old prophet learned in the cave at Mount Horeb, when he hid his face, and the still, small voice asked, "What doest thou here, Elijah?"—that however we may fancy ourselves alone on the side of good, the King and Lord of men is nowhere without his witnesses; for in every society, however seemingly corrupt and godless, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

11．He found, too, how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be produced by his act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh when he knelt down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all the other boys but three or four followed the lead.



EXERCISES.—Relate Tom's early experience at Rugby. Was it courageous in him to stop saying his prayers? How did he feel over it? What did he resolve to do? Did he carry out his resolve? What two lessons was he taught?





【中文阅读】


1．在当时一个小孩子当众祷告需要不小的勇气，在整个拉格比也是这样。几年后，阿诺德校长以勇敢和虔诚开始潜移默化地转变这种风气，在他去世前，至少拉格比学校的情形不同了。我想其他学校里并没有什么变化。

2．但是可怜的汤姆没赶上好时候，他来的头几晚因为喧闹没有跪地祷告，而是坐在床上，等蜡烛熄灭后溜出去祷告，怕让别人看到。可怜的小孩子很多都这么做。

3．后来他想干脆就在床上祷告吧，然后他想，不论是跪着还是坐着或躺着有什么关系。这就是事情的经过，不愿意当着别人的面祷告的人都是这么做的；最后一年，他很多次祷告都敷衍了事。

4．可怜的汤姆，最先也是最令他痛苦的就是他的懦弱，这让他的心都碎了。他想到了别的令他厌恶的罪恶，这些罪恶现在让他的灵魂备受煎熬。他对母亲、自己的良心和上帝说了谎。他怎么能容忍呢？然而，这可怜的柔弱的男孩，这个曾让他感到怜悯，甚至鄙视男孩，却做了这件他这么自负的人都没有勇气做的事。

5．他发誓要支持那个孩子面对困难，因为他这个晚上做的好事，他要鼓励他，帮助他，帮他分担，这给他带来一丝安慰。他决定第二天给家里写封信，告诉母亲发生的一切，告诉她自己曾经是个胆小鬼。他下定决心要在第二天早上证明自己，这时他感到平静了。

6．他想到第二天早上可能会更难，可是他再也不能失去另一次机会了。他动摇了好几次，心里的魔鬼暗示他，他的老朋友都会称他“圣人”、“老古板”等难听的称呼，魔鬼小声告诉他别人会误解他的动机，说他会和新来的男孩一起众叛亲离；可是，只有战胜各种各样的不良影响，才能做最有益的事情。

7．更狡猾的诱惑出现了，“我不这么逞强不行吗？我必须现在开始吗？我是不是应该在书房祷告，让别人了解我这么做，并努力引导他们，可是在公开场合，还和以前一样？”可是他的好天使那晚太强大了，他翻了个身准备睡觉了，他已经厌烦推理，决心按照那股强烈的让他找到内心平静的冲动去做。

8．第二天早上，洗完脸穿好衣服，没有穿外套和西装背心，预备的钟声响起的时候，当着全屋人的面，他跪下来祷告。还没说五个字，铃声就响了起来，像在嘲笑他；他注意听着别人的耳语，他们会怎么想他呢？

9.他很害羞跪下祷告，终于，好像从内心深处，一个微小的声音坚定地说出了税官说的那些话，“愿上帝怜悯我这个罪人！”他一遍又一遍地重复着，紧紧抓住它们不放，然后站了起来，这时他感到了安慰和谦卑，他已经做好面对整个世界的准备了。

10．他的担心是多余的：阿瑟旁边另两个男孩已经和他一样跪了下来，他感到又学到了一课——征服了自己内心的懦弱就是征服了世界；他也明白了当以利亚藏身在基立溪旁的山洞时，为什么会有一个坚定的声音问他，“你在这里做什么，以利亚？”——不论我们觉得自己在世界上有多孤独，神灵是看得见的；一个不论多么腐败和不敬神的社会，总有不向邪恶屈服的人。

11．他还发现，他是多么夸大了自己行为的影响。接下来的几个晚上，当他跪下祷告时都有一两声嘲笑，可是很快就听不到了。不久，除三四个男孩以外，其他人一个个都和他一样祷告了。

LESSON 69

THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS

赫斯珀洛斯号的残骸


By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the greatest of American poets. He was born in Portland, Me., in 1807. For some years he held the professorship of Modern Languages in Bowdoin College, and later a similar professorship in Harvard College. He died March 24th, 1882.

1．It was the schooner Hesperus,

That sailed the wintry sea;

And the skipper(1) had taken his little daughter,

To bear him company.

2．Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,

Her cheeks like the dawn of day,

And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,

That ope in the month of May.

3．The skipper, he stood beside the helm,

His pipe was in his mouth,

And he watched how the veering(2) flaw(3) did blow

The smoke now west, now south.

4．Then up and spake an old sailor,

Had sailed to the Spanish Main(4),

"I pray thee, put into yonder port(5),

For I fear the hurricane.

5．"Last night, the moon had a golden ring,

And to-night no moon we see!"

The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,

And a scornful laugh laughed he.

6．Colder and louder blew the wind,

A gale from the northeast;

The snow fell hissing in the brine(6),

And the billows frothed like yeast.

7．Down came the storm, and smote amain(7)

The vessel in its strength;

She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,

Then leaped her cable's length.

8．"Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,

And do not tremble so;

For I can weather(8) the roughest gale

That ever wind did blow."

9．He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat,

Against the stinging blast:

He cut a rope from a broken spar(9),

And bound her to the mast.

10．"O father! I hear the church bells ring,

Oh say, what may it be?"

"'Tis a fog bell on a rock-bound coast!"—

And he steered for the open sea.

11．"O father! I hear the sound of guns,

Oh say, what may it be?"

"Some ship in distress, that can not live

In such an angry sea!"

12．"O father! I see a gleaming light,

Oh say, what may it be?"

But the father answered never a word,

A frozen corpse was he.

13．Lashed to the helm(10), all stiff and stark,

With his face turned to the skies,

The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow

On his fixed and glassy eyes.

14．Then the maiden clasped her hands, and prayed

That saved she might be;

And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave

On the lake of Galilee.

15．And fast through the midnight dark and drear,

Through the whistling sleet and snow,

Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept

Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe(11).

16．And ever the fitful gusts between

A sound came from the land:

It was the sound of the trampling surf

On the rocks and the hard sea sand.

17．The breakers were right beneath her bows,

She drifted a dreary wreck,

And a whooping billow swept the crew

Like icicles from her deck.

18．She struck where the white and fleecy waves

Looked soft as carded(12) wool,

But the cruel rocks, they gored her side

Like the horns of an angry bull.

19．Her rattling shrouds(13), all sheathed in ice,

With the masts, went by the board(14);

Like a vessel of glass, she stove(15) and sank,

Ho! ho! the breakers roared!

20．At daybreak, on the bleak seabeach,

A fisherman stood aghast,

To see the form of a maiden fair

Lashed close to a drifting mast.

21．The salt sea was frozen on her breast,

The salt tears in her eyes;

And he saw her hair, like the brown seaweed,

On the billows fall and rise.

22．Such was the wreck of the Hesperus

In the midnight and the snow:

Heav'n save us all from a death like this

On the reef of Norman's Woe!

1．帆船赫斯珀洛斯号；

行驶在冬天的大海上。

船长把他的小女儿，

带在身边陪伴他。

2．她的眼珠蓝得像亚麻花，

脸颊像明媚的晨光，

雪白的胸脯像

五月里绽放的山楂花。

3．船长站在舵边，

嘴里叼着烟斗，

观察着不停变化的风向，

时而向西，时而向南。

4．老船员走过来，

他曾到过危险的加勒比海岸，

说，“请您快点驶入港口，

恐怕会刮起飓风。”

5．“昨晚我看见月亮的金边，

今晚却看不见月亮了！”

吐了一口烟，

船长哈哈笑着，不屑一顾地。

6．风刮得更猛，天也更寒冷，

忽然有大风，从东北刮来；

雪嘶嘶叫着落在海上，

海上掀起了巨浪。

7．暴风雪突然来了，

用力拍打着帆船，

帆船摇摇晃晃，像受惊的马儿，

跃起到缆绳那么高。

8．“到这儿来！到这儿来！我的小女儿，

你不要害怕；

再大的风浪，

我也能挺得过”

9．他脱下海员服给女儿穿上，

对抗凛冽刺骨的寒风；

从折断的侧板上割下一段绳子，

把小女儿缠在桅杆上。

10．“噢，爸爸！我听到教堂的钟声响了，

出了什么事？”

“海岸起了大雾，钟声才响起！”

船长把船朝大海驶去。

11．“噢，爸爸！我听到枪声响起，

出了什么事？”

“有船遇麻烦了，

海浪太凶猛，估计好不了！”

12．“噢，爸爸！我见到了微弱的灯光，

出了什么事？”

可是她的父亲

已经无法回答，他已经冻僵了。

13．船长的身体靠在舵上，全身僵硬，

仰面朝天，

灯光透过雪的光芒，

照在他已失去生气的双眼上。

14．女孩合起双手，开始祷告，

愿自己得救；

她想起基督在加利利湖上，

让波浪平息。

15．漆黑恐怖的午夜，

风雪嘶嘶叫着，

赫斯珀洛斯号像扬帆的鬼船，

迅速驶向诺曼沃暗礁。

16．阵阵的大风当中，

不时从岸上传来一声，

浪花拍打在

岩石上面的声音。

17．这声音就在船头下方，

帆船已毁坏。

巨浪把所有船员冲走了，

就像冲走了的冰柱。

18．帆船已卡在一处

波浪拍岸掀起浪花的地方。

岩石撞击着帆船，

如同愤怒的牛用角乱撞。

19．桅杆侧支索被冰裹着，

发出嘎嘎响声，

桅杆已滑向大海里。

看！看！巨浪依然拍打着岩石！

20．黎明凄凉的海滩上，

一个渔夫已目瞪口呆。

他看到冰雪里裹着一个美丽的少女，

绑在桅杆上。

21．胸脯上海水已结冰，

眼中含着泪水。

她的长发像是海草，

随巨浪起伏。

22．这就是暴风雪的午夜，

赫斯珀洛斯号帆船的残骸，

愿主保佑我们，使我们在

人生的诺曼沃暗礁得到拯救。

LESSON 70

ANECDOTES OF BIRDS

鸟类趣闻


1．I had once a favorite black hen, "a great beauty," as she was called by everyone, and so I thought her; her feathers were so jetty, and her topping so white and full! She knew my voice as well as any dog, and used to run cackling and bustling to my hand to receive the fragments that I never failed to collect from the breakfast table for "Yarico," as she was called.

2．Yarico, by the time she was a year old, hatched a respectable family of chickens; little, cowering, timid things at first, but, in due time, they became fine chubby ones; and old Norah said, "If I could only keep Yarico out of the copse(1), it would do; but the copse is full of weasels and of foxes.

3．"I have driven her back twenty times; but she watches till some one goes out of the gate, and then she's off again. It is always the case with young hens, Miss; they think they know better than their keepers; and nothing cures them but losing a brood or two of chickens." I have often thought since that young people, as well as young hens, buy their experience equally dear.

4．One morning, after breakfast, I went to seek my favorite in the poultry yard; plenty of hens were there, but no Yarico. The gate was open, and, as I concluded she had sought the forbidden copse, I proceeded there, accompanied by the yard mastiff, a noble fellow, steady and sagacious(2) as a judge.

5．At the end of a lane, flanked on one side by a quickset hedge, on the other by a wild common, what was called the copse commenced; but before I arrived near the spot I heard a loud and tremendous cackling, and met two young, long-legged pullets, running with both wings and feet toward home. Jock pricked up his sharp ears, and would have set off at full gallop to the copse; but I restrained him, hastening onward, however, at the top of my speed, thinking I had as good a right to see what was the matter as Jock.

6．Poor Yarico! An impertinent(3) fox cub had attempted to carry off one of her children; but she had managed to get them behind her in the hedge, and venturing boldly forth had placed herself in front, and positively kept the impudent animal at bay. His desire for plunder had prevented his noticing our approach, and Jock soon made him feel the superiority of an Englishmastiff over a cub fox.

7．The most interesting portion of my tale is to come. Yarico not only never afterward ventured to the copse, but formed a strong friendship for the dog which had preserved her family. Whenever he appeared in the yard, she would run to meet him, prating and clucking all the time, and impeding his progress by walking between his legs, to his no small annoyance. If any other dog entered the yard, she would fly at him most furiously, thinking, perhaps, that he would injure her chickens; but she evidently considered Jock her especial protector, and treated him accordingly.

8．It was very droll to see the peculiar look with which he regarded his feathered friend; not knowing exactly what to make of her civilities, and doubting how they should be received. When her family were educated, and able to do without her care, she was a frequent visitor at Jock's kennel(4), and would, if permitted, roost there at night, instead of returning with the rest of the poultry to the henhouse. Yarico certainly was a most grateful and interesting bird.

9．One could almost believe a parrot had intellect, when he keeps up a conversation so spiritedly; and it is certainly singular to observe how accurately a well-trained bird will apply his knowledge. A friend of mine knew one that had been taught many sentences; thus, "Sally, Poll wants her breakfast!" "Sally, Poll wants her tea!" but she never mistook the one for the other; breakfast was invariably demanded in the morning, and tea in the afternoon; and she always hailed her master, but no one else, by "How do you do, Mr. A?"

10．She was a most amusing bird, and could whistle dogs, which she had great pleasure in doing. She would drop bread out of her cage as she hung at the street door, and whistle a number about her, and then, just as they were going to possess themselves of her bounty, utter a shrill scream of "Get out, dogs!" with such vehemence(5) and authority as dispersed the assembled company without a morsel, to her infinite delight.

11．How wonderful is that instinct by which the bird of passage performs its annual migration(6)! But how still more wonderful is it when the bird, after its voyage of thousands of miles has been performed, and new lands visited, returns to the precise window or eaves where, the summer before, it first enjoyed existence! And yet, such is unquestionably the fact.

12．Four brothers had watched with indignation the felonious(7) attempts of a sparrow to possess himself of the nest of a house martin, in which lay its young brood of four unfledged birds.

13．The little fellows considered themselves as champions for the bird which had come over land and sea, and chosen its shelter under their mother's roof. They therefore marshaled themselves with blowguns, to execute summary vengeance; but their well-meant endeavors brought destruction upon the mud-built domicile(8) they wished to defend. Their artillery(9) loosened the foundations, and down it came, precipitating its four little inmates to the ground. The mother of the children, Good Samaritan-like, replaced the little outcasts in their nest, and set it in the open window of an unoccupied chamber.

14．The parent birds, after the first terror was over, did not appear disconcerted(10) by the change of situation, but hourly fed their young as usual, and testified, by their unwearied twitter of pleasure, the satisfaction and confidence they felt. There the young birds were duly fledged, and from that window they began their flight, and entered upon life.

15．The next spring, with the reappearance of the martins, came four, which familiarly flew into the chamber, visited all the walls, and expressed their recognition(11) by the most clamorous twitterings of joy. They were, without question, the very birds that had been bred there the preceding year.

1．我曾经有一只最喜爱的黑色大母鸡，名字叫“大美人”，人们都这么叫她，她真是一只美丽的大母鸡。身上的羽毛漆黑，头顶上的羽毛又白又密！她的听觉像狗一样灵敏，能听出我的声音，常常咯咯叫着，跑着到我的手上啄食，我从不忘记拾起桌上的剩饭给雅丽克，雅丽克是她的名字。

2．那时雅丽克已经一岁了，她已经孵育了一大群小鸡；这些小东西一开始还蹑手蹑脚的，胆子很小，可是渐渐地，变得胖乎乎的；老诺拉说：“我得让雅丽克离小树林远点，那里都是黄鼬和狐狸。

3．“我把她赶回来二十次了；可是她专门瞧着人出门的时候溜出去。小姐，小母鸡可都这样；她们自以为比主人聪明；不丢一两窝小鸡她们可记不住。”此后我就常想，年轻人和小母鸡一样，买个教训总要花上大价钱。

4．一天上午，早饭后，我到养殖场找这只我最喜爱的大母鸡；很多母鸡都在那里，却不见了雅丽克。门开着，我判断她一定是偷着去禁地了，我朝那边走，马士提夫獒犬跟着我；雄赳赳的，步伐稳重，目光敏锐，神态庄重，像法官一样。

5．小路的一边是简易的栅栏，另外一边是片空地，小路的尽头就是小树林了。可是还没到小树林，就听到了咯咯的尖叫声，两只小母鸡，张着翅膀，朝家的方向奔跑。泽克马上立起了尖耳朵，朝小树林就要跑过去，我拉住了他以最快的速度向那个方向跑去，我想我和泽克一样有权看一看究竟发生了什么。

6．可怜的雅丽克！一只莽撞的小狐狸试图叼走她的一个孩子；她设法把小鸡挡在身后的栅栏里，雅丽克冒着危险冲在前面，无礼的小狐狸明显被逼到了死胡同。小狐狸一心做强盗，没注意到靠近的我们，泽克很快就让他感到了英国马士提夫獒犬的优势地位。

7．我就要讲到最有趣的地方了。雅丽克此后不仅不再冒险去小树林了，而且还和保护了她一家的马士提夫獒犬结下了深厚的友谊。不论泽克什么时候出现在鸡场，她都会跑去迎接他，咯咯地叫个不停，还会走在泽克的两腿之间，给他造成了不小的烦恼。如果别的狗进了鸡场，她会猛冲过去，担心她的孩子受到伤害；可她显然觉得泽克是她的保护者，因此对泽克非常亲热。

8．泽克对他的长满羽毛的朋友那副奇怪的表情显得很滑稽；不知道怎么回报她的热情，泽克显得手足无措。当她的孩子们长大了，用不着她时刻照看的时候，雅丽克常常到犬舍做客，有时晚上就在犬舍栖息，而不是和别的小鸡一样回鸡舍。雅丽克确实是只最知恩图报最有趣的小鸡。

9．如果看到鹦鹉活泼地与人交谈，甚至相信他是有智力的动物。观察一只受到良好训练的鹦鹉准确地运用这种知识确实很新奇。我的一个朋友见过一只会说很多话的鹦鹉。例如，“萨拉，波尔要吃早餐！”“萨拉，波尔要喝茶！”还从来没用错过；早上要早餐，下午要茶；而且见到主人时总是说：“你好啊，A先生？”却从不对别人这样说。

10．这真是一只有趣的鸟，她甚至能吹口号招呼狗，从中得到很多乐趣。当人们把鸟笼挂在门口的时候，她会扔出一块面包到鸟笼外面，然后吹一段口哨，狗儿闻讯赶来。就在狗儿去吃面包的时候，她会发出尖叫“狗儿，滚开！”声音里充满了力量和权威，狗儿一点也没吃到就跑了，她可快乐极了。

11．候鸟具有每年准确迁徙的惊人本能！可是当鸟儿在飞行了上千里，在新家过冬后，依然能准确地飞回前一年夏天出生的那个窗户或屋檐，这是多么奇妙啊！可是，毫无疑问事实就是这样。

12．四兄弟愤怒地看到一只麻雀试图夺取一只燕子的巢窠，里面有四只羽翼未丰的小燕子。

13．四兄弟觉得自己是英雄，因为鸟儿飞跃陆地和海洋后选择了自家的屋顶。因此他们拿着气枪匆忙向麻雀讨公道，可是他们的尝试给他们要保卫的用泥土垒成的巢窠带来了灾难。巢窠的根基被炮火动摇了，掉落在地上，四只雏燕摔到了地上。四兄弟的妈妈，就像善良的撒马利亚人一样，把四只雏燕放回巢窠，放在一扇未住人的房间的窗户上方。

14．经历了最初的恐慌后，成年燕子没有因为环境改变而显得不安，仍然每隔一小时给小鸟喂食，不知疲倦唧唧喳喳的欢叫着，充满满足和信心。在这个窗户上方四只小鸟长大了。

15．第二年春天，随着燕子迁徙归来，四只燕子熟悉地飞到那个房间的窗口，在墙上飞来飞去，唧唧喳喳地，显得非常熟悉。毫无疑问，这是头一年在那里出生的四只雏燕。

LESSON 71

THE RAINBOW PILGRIMAGE

彩虹之旅


By Sara J. Lippincott, born at Onondaga, N. Y., in 1823, of New England parentage. Under the name of "Grace Greenwood" she has written many charming stories for children. Some of her best sketches are in "Records of Five Years."



1．One summer afternoon, when I was about eight years of age, I was standing at an eastern window, looking at a beautiful rainbow that, bending from the sky, seemed to be losing itself in a thick, swampy wood about a quarter of a mile distant.

2．It happened that no one was in the room with me then but my brother Rufus, who was just recovering(1) from a severe illness, and was sitting, propped up with pillows, in an easy-chair, looking out, with me, at the rainbow.

3．"See, brother," I said, "it drops right down among the cedars, where we go in the spring to find wintergreens(2)!"

4．"Do you know, Gracie," said my brother, with a very serious face, "that if you should go to the end of the rainbow, you would find there purses filled with money, and great pots of gold and silver?"

5．"Is it truly so?" I asked.

6．"Truly so," answered my brother, with a smile. Now, I was a simple-hearted child who believed everything that was told me, although I was again and again imposed(3) upon; so, without another word, I darted out of the door, and set forth toward the wood. My brother called after me as loudly as he was able, but I did not heed him.

7．I cared nothing for the wet grass, which was sadly drabbling(4) my clean frock,—on and on I ran: I was so sure that I knew just where that rainbow ended. I remember how glad and proud I was in my thoughts, and what fine presents I promised to all my friends out of my great riches.

8．So thinking, and laying delightful plans, almost before I knew it I had reached the cedar grove, and the end of the rainbow was not there! But I saw it shining down among the trees a little farther off; so on and on I struggled, through the thick bushes and over logs, till I came within the sound of a stream which ran through the swamp. Then I thought, "What if the rainbow should come down right in the middle of that deep, muddy brook!"

9．Ah! but I was frightened for my heavy pots of gold and silver, and my purses of money. How should I ever find them there? and what a time I should have getting them out! I reached the bank of the stream, and "the end was not yet." But I could see it a little way off on the other side. I crossed the creek on a fallen tree, and still ran on, though my limbs seemed to give way, and my side ached with fatigue.

10．The woods grew thicker and darker, the ground more wet and swampy, and I found, as many grown people had found before me, that there was rather hard traveling in a journey after riches. Suddenly I met in my way a large porcupine(5), who made himself still larger when he saw me, as a cross cat raises its back and makes tails at a dog. Fearing that he would shoot his sharp quills at me, I ran from him as fast as my tired feet would carry me.

11．In my fright and hurry I forgot to keep my eye on the rainbow, as I had done before; and when, at last, I remembered and looked for it, it was nowhere in sight! It had quite faded away. When I saw that it was indeed gone, I burst into tears; for I had lost all my treasures, and had nothing to show for my pilgrimage(6) but muddy feet and a wet and torn frock. So I set out for home.

12．But I soon found that my troubles had only begun; I could not find my way: I was lost! I could not tell which was east or west, north or south, but wandered about here and there, crying and calling, though I knew that no one could hear me.

13．All at once I heard voices shouting and hallooing; but, instead of being rejoiced at this, I was frightened, fearing that the Indians were upon me! I crawled under some bushes, by the side of a large log, and lay perfectly still. I was wet, cold, scared, —altogether very miserable indeed; yet, when the voices came near, I did not start up and show myself.

14．At last I heard my own name called; but I remembered that Indians were very cunning, and thought they might have found it out some way, so I did not answer. Then came a voice near me, that sounded like that of my eldest brother, who lived away from home, and whom I had not seen for many months; but I dared not believe that the voice was his.

15．Soon some one sprang up on the log by which I lay, and stood there calling. I could not see his face; I could only see the tips of his toes, but by them I saw that he wore a nice pair of boots, and not moccasins(7). Yet I remembered that some Indians dressed like white folks; so I still kept quiet, till I heard shouted over me a pet name, which this brother had given me. It was the funniest name in the world.

16．I knew that no Indian knew of the name, as it was a little family secret; so I sprang up, and caught my brother about the ankles. I hardly think that an Indian could have given a louder yell than he gave then; and he jumped so that he fell off the log down by my side. But nobody was hurt; and, after kissing me till he had kissed away all my tears, he hoisted me on to his shoulder, called my other brothers, who were hunting in different directions, and we all set out for home.

17．I had been gone nearly three hours, and had wandered a number of miles. My brother Joseph's coming and asking for me, had first set them to inquiring and searching me out. When I went into the room where my brother Rufus sat, he said, "Why, my poor little sister! I did not mean to send you off on such a wild-goose chase to the end of the rainbow. I thought you would know I was only quizzing(8) you."

18．Then my eldest brother took me on his knee, and told me what the rainbow really is: that it is only painted air, and does not rest on the earth, so nobody could ever find the end; and that God has set it in the cloud to remind him and us of his promise never again to drown the world with a flood. "Oh, I think God's Promise would be a beautiful name for the rainbow!" I said.

19．"Yes," replied my mother, "but it tells us something more than that he will not send great floods upon the earth,—it tells us of his beautiful love always bending over us from the skies. And I trust that when my little girl sets forth on a pilgrimage to find God's love, she will be led by the rainbow of his promise through all the dark places of this world to 'treasures laid up in heaven,' better, far better, than silver or gold."

萨拉·利平科特，1823年生于纽约州的奥隆达加，父母居住在新英格兰。以“格雷斯·格林伍德”为笔名，写了很多迷人的儿童故事。《五年记录》包括一些著名的故事。



1．我八岁时，一个夏天的下午，我站在窗边，看着美丽的彩虹从天边弯下来，似乎消失在四分之一英里外的一片沼泽密林里。

2．当时房间里只有我和我的哥哥鲁弗斯，重伤康复的他靠着枕头坐在扶手椅里，和我一起看彩虹。

3．“看，哥哥，”我说，“彩虹正好落在雪松林里，我们春天还在那儿找过鹿蹄草呢！”

4．“你知道吗，格雷西，”哥哥认真地说，“如果你到彩虹尽头，你会找到鼓鼓的钱包，和一罐罐的金银？”

5．“真的吗？”我问。

6．“真的，”哥哥笑着说。我当时还是一个头脑简单的孩子，尽管多次被骗，但别人说什么我仍然信以为真。于是，二话不说，我蹦蹦跳跳地跑出门，向树林跑去。哥哥大声喊我的名字，可是我并没注意。

7．我完全不顾潮湿的草地是不是弄脏了我干净的连衣裙，只是不停地跑：我相信我知道彩虹的尽头在哪儿。我是那么开心和自豪，我发誓用我的巨大财富把最好的礼物送给好朋友们。

8．这样想着，开心地计划着，不知不觉就到了雪松林，彩虹的尽头却不在那儿！可是我看见不远处的树林里发出彩虹的光；因此，我挣扎着继续向前走，穿过茂盛的灌木丛，跨过伐倒的圆木，走着走着，我听到了穿过沼泽的小溪的流水声。我想，“是彩虹落在又深又泥泞的小溪里可怎么办呢！”

9．啊！我不禁担心起那满罐的金银和鼓鼓的钱包了。打捞可不容易！我来到了溪边，“彩虹的尽头也不在那儿”。我看到它就在小溪对面不远的地方。我踩着一棵伐倒的树过了小溪，继续向前跑，我的双腿已经不太听使唤了，腰也很疼。

10．树林更密更黑，地面也更湿更难走，和很多成年人一样，我发现寻找财宝的路非常艰辛。突然，我遇到了一只豪猪，它一见我就耸起了身躯，就像坏脾气的猫遇到狗的时候，弓起背，竖起尾巴的样子。我拔起劳累的双腿就跑，生怕豪猪会用刺刺我。

11．匆忙和害怕中，我忘记了彩虹。最后，想起彩虹的时候，哪儿也见不到了！彩虹消逝了。当我确定彩虹确实不见了，我嚎啕大哭起来；我已经失去了财宝，我的寻宝之旅什么也没找到，而且双腿还沾满泥，连衣裙也又湿又破。我只能回家了。

12．我很快发现我的麻烦才刚刚开始，我找不到回家的路了！我分不出东西南北，四处打转，一边哭一边喊叫，可我也知道没人会听到。

13．突然我听到人们的喊叫声；我没有感到高兴，相反却很害怕，我担心是印第安人来追赶我！我趴在一棵伐倒的圆木旁的灌木丛里，一动不动。我又湿又冷又害怕，非常痛苦；可是当声音靠近的时候，我并没有站起来。

14．最后我听到有人喊我的名字；我记得印第安人非常狡诈，我想他们可能通过某种方式知道了我的名字，因此我没有出声。这时我听见身边有人喊，声音像是我大哥的，他不在家住，几个月没见了，可我不敢相信这声音是他的。

15．很快有人跳到我身边的圆木上，站着大声喊我。我看不到他的脸，从他的鞋尖，我看到他穿着新靴子，不是印第安人穿的软皮平底鞋。可是我记得有些印第安人的穿着和白人一样；所以我还是没出声，终于我听到喊我的昵称，这个昵称是我的大哥起的，是世界上最可笑的昵称。

16．印第安人肯定不知道这个名字，因为这是一个家庭小秘密。我于是跳了起来，抓住哥哥的腿。他发出一声大叫，我想没有任何印第安人叫得比他的声音大，他从圆木上跳下来，正巧跌倒在我旁边。我俩都没伤着，他不断亲着我，把我的泪水都亲没了。他把我举到肩膀上，叫着分头寻找我的其他哥哥的名字，一起出发往家走。

17．后来知道当我离家快三个小时，走了好几英里的时候，我的哥哥约瑟夫刚好来家里，知道我的情况后，立即开始让人们分头寻找。当我走进鲁弗斯房间的时候，他说：“怎么了，可怜的小妹妹！我可没想让你没头没脑地找什么彩虹的尽头。我以为你知道我在逗你玩呢。”

18．然后大哥把我抱到膝盖上，告诉我什么是彩虹：彩虹只是带有色彩的空气，也不是立在地上的，因此不会找到彩虹的尽头。上帝在云里创造了彩虹，是为了提醒他和人们，他曾经发誓不再发洪水。“噢，我想‘上帝的约定’这个名字更好！”我说。

19．“是的，”妈妈回答说，“可是，彩虹告诉我们的比不再发洪水还要多。它告诉我们，他对人类美好的爱永远来自天上。我相信当我的小女孩启程寻找上帝之爱的时候，在上帝的彩虹的引导下，世界上任何黑暗的地方都挡不住，最终将找到‘天上的财富’，这财富比任何金银都珍贵。”

LESSON 72

THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET

旧橡木桶


By Samuel Woodworth, who was born in Massachusetts in 1785. He was both author and editor. This is his best known poem. He died in 1842.



1．How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,



When fond recollection presents them to view!

The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wildwood,

And every loved spot which my infancy knew;

The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it:

The bridge and the rock where the cataract(1) fell:

The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it,

And e'en the rude bucket which hung in the well:

The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,

The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.



2．That moss-covered vessel I hail as a treasure;

For often, at noon, when returned from the field,

I found it the source of an exquisite(2) pleasure,

The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.

How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,

And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;

Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing(3),

And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well:

The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,

The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.



3．How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,

As poised(4) on the curb, it inclined to my lips!

Not a full blushing goblet(5) could tempt me to leave it,

Though filled with the nectar(6) which Jupiter sips;

And now, far removed from thy loved situation,

The tear of regret will intrusively(7) swell,

As fancy reverts(8) to my father's plantation,

And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well:

The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,

The moss-covered bucket, which hangs in the well.



EXERCISES.—Who was the author of “The Old Oaken Bucket”? What is said of this piece? What does the poem describe? and what feeling does it express?

塞缪尔·伍德沃思，1785年生于马萨诸塞州。他既是作家也是编辑。本诗是他最著名的作品。他于1842年去世。

1．童年的时光多么美好，

童年的回忆如在眼前！

果园、草地和茂盛的密林，

童年里处处如此可爱；

宽阔的池塘，池塘边的磨坊：

小桥、山石、瀑布流淌：

爸爸的畜棚，旁边的奶牛舍，

井里挂着粗制的木桶：

旧橡木桶，包着铁的木桶，

覆盖着苔藓，悬挂在井里。

2．覆盖苔藓的木桶是我的宝贝；

多少个日中，从田地返回，

它打上来大自然最甘甜的井水，

带给我无限的欢喜。

双手抓住它时多么激动，

立刻沉到白鹅卵石的井底；

片刻间木桶似盛满真理，

从井里升起，滴滴清凉；

这就是旧橡木桶，包铁的木桶，

覆盖着苔藓的木桶，从井里升起。

3．从长着绿色苔藓的桶边喝甜甜的水，

把木桶立在井栏上，向唇边倾斜着木桶！

即使是朱庇特的酒杯盛满琼浆玉液，

也不能让我离开这甜甜的井水；

这些可爱的情景已经远去，

思念的泪水不禁溢满双眼，

幻想回到爸爸的种植园，

挂在井里的木桶仍令我叹息；

旧橡木桶，铁箍的橡木桶，

挂在井里的，覆盖苔藓的橡木桶。

LESSON 73

THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT

登山宝训


1．And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples(1) came unto him; and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,

2．Blessed(2) are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit(3) the earth.

3．Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.

4．Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

5．Blessed are ye when men shall revile(4) you, and persecute(5) you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven.

6．Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear(6) thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

7．Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

8．Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

9．Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy: but I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully(7) use you and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

10．For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans(8) the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye, therefore, perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

11．Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete(9), it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote(10) that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

12．Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite(11), first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

13．Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for everyone that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

14．If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.

15．Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

16．And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

17．And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes(12).



EXERCISES.—Who delivered this sermon? Who are blessed? and why? Is it right to swear? How should we treat our enemies? Should we judge others harshly? What does Jesus say of him who finds faults in his neighbor, but does not see his own? What is said about prayer? About our conduct to others?

1．看到众人，他走上山。坐下后，信徒们走上来；他开口教导他们，说：

2．虚心的人有福了；因为天国是他们的。悲伤的人有福了，因为他们将得到安慰。顺从的人有福了，因为他们将继承世界。

3．对正直如饥似渴的人有福了，因为他们会充满正直。慈爱的人有福了，因为他们将得到慈爱。心地纯净的人有福了，因为他们将见到神。

4．使人和睦的人有福了，因为他们将被称作神的子民。因为正直而受到迫害的人有福了，因为天国是他们的。

5．人或因我而辱骂你们、迫害你们、捏造各种恶毒的话诽谤你们，你们有福了。你们应该欢喜快乐，因为你们在天上的回报是大的。

6．你们曾经听到古人说，不可背誓，而应该向主遵守誓言；可是我要对你们说，什么誓都不要起；不要以天国的名义起誓，因为天国是上帝的宝座；不要以大地的名义起誓，因为大地是上帝的脚凳；不要以耶路撒冷的名义起誓，因为它是王的城市。

7．不要用你的头起誓，因为你不能命令一根头发变白或变黑。是，就说是，不是，就说不是；多余的话都是出自邪恶的。

8．你曾经听见有人说，以眼还眼，以牙还牙；可是我要对你们说，你们不要拒绝邪恶；有人打你的右脸，把另一边也转向他。要是有人在法庭告你，拿走你的衬衣，把外套也给他。有人迫使你走一英里，你就和他走二英里。有求你的，就给他，有向你借贷的，不可推辞。

9．你们曾经听人说，爱你的邻居，恨你的敌人。可是我要对你们说，爱你的敌人；祝福诅咒你的人，对恨你的人做善事，为迫害你的人祷告；这样你们才是天父的子民；因为他让太阳不但照耀善人，也照耀恶人，雨水不但降给义人，也降给不义的人。

10．因为如果你只爱那爱你的人，能有什么回报呢？税吏不也一样吗？如果你只和兄弟打招呼，你比别人强在哪里呢？税吏不也一样吗？因此，你们要做完美的人，因为天上的父是完美的。

11．不要评判他人，就不会被他人评判。因为你在评判他人的同时，他人也同样评判你；你衡量别人，别人也同样衡量你。你为什么只看见兄弟眼里的刺，却不见自己眼里的梁木呢？

12．你怎么会对兄弟说，让我拿掉你眼里的刺，可是看啊，你的眼里还有梁木呢？你们这些伪善的人，先拿掉你眼里的梁木，看清楚之后再拿掉你兄弟眼里的刺。

13．祈求，必会得到；寻找，必会找到；敲门，门必开启；凡祈求的人必会得到；凡寻找的人必会发现，敲门的人，门必会开启。如果你的儿子向你要面包，你们有人给他石头吗？如果你的儿子向你要鱼，你们有人给他蛇吗？

14．你们虽然不好，也知道给儿女好礼物，那么在天上的父岂不会给求他的人更好的礼物？因此，无论你要他人如何对你，你也要同样对待他们，因为这是律法，是先知的教诲。

15．任何听到我的话信受奉行的人，我把他们比作把房子建在山岩上的智者，雨淋、水冲、风吹，房子不会倒塌，因为是建在山岩上的。

16．任何听到我的话不信受奉行的人，我把他们比作把房子建在沙滩上的蠢人，雨淋、水冲、风吹，房子倒塌，因为是建在沙滩上的，而且倒塌得很严重。

17．当耶稣讲了这些话后，人们对他的教诲都感到十分惊讶，因为他教诲他们，正像一个有权的人，而不像他们的文士。

LESSON 74

THE YOUNG WITNESS

小证人


1．A little girl nine years of age was brought into court, and offered as a witness(1) against a prisoner who was on trial for a crime committed(2) in her father's house.

2．"Now, Emily," said the counsel(3) for the prisoner, "I wish to know if you understand the nature of an oath?"

3．"I don't know what you mean," was the simple answer.

4．"Your Honor," said the counsel, addressing the judge, "it is evident that this witness should be rejected(4). She does not understand the nature of an oath."

5．"Let us see," said the judge. "Come here, my daughter."

6．Assured(5) by the kind tone and manner of the judge, the child stepped toward him, and looked confidingly(6) in his face, with a calm, clear eye, and in a manner so artless and frank that it went straight to the heart.

7．"Did you ever take an oath?" inquired the judge.

8．The little girl stepped back with a look of horror; and the red blood rose and spread in a blush all over her face and neck, as she answered, "No, sir." She thought he intended to ask if she had ever used profane(7) language.

9．"I do not mean that," said the judge, who saw her mistake; "I mean were you ever a witness?"

10．"No, sir; I never was in court before," was the answer.

11．He handed her the Bible open. "Do you know that book, my daughter?"

12．She looked at it and answered, "Yes, sir; it is the Bible."

13．"Do you ever read in it?" he asked.

14．"Yes, sir; every evening."

15．"Can you tell me what the Bible is?" inquired the judge.

16．"It is the word of the great God," she answered.

17．"Well," said the judge, "place your hand upon this Bible, and listen to what I say;" and he repeated slowly and solemnly the following oath: "Do you swear that in the evidence which you shall give in this case, you will tellthe truth, and nothing but the truth; and that you will ask God to help you?"

18．"I do," she replied.

19．"Now," said the judge, "you have been sworn as a witness; will you tell me what will befall you if you do not tell the truth?"

20．"I shall be shut up in the state prison," answered the child.

21．"Anything else?" asked the judge.

22．"I shall never go to heaven," she replied.

23．"How do you know this?" asked the judge again.

24．The child took the Bible, turned rapidly to the chapter containing the commandments, and, pointing to the one which reads, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," said, "I learned that before I could read."

25．"Has anyone talked with you about being a witness in court here against this man?" inquired the judge.

26．"Yes, sir," she replied, "my mother heard they wanted me to be a witness; and last night she called me to her room, and asked me to tell her the Ten Commandments; and then we kneeled down together, and she prayed that I might understand how wicked it was to bear false witness against my neighbor, and that God would help me, a little child, to tell the truth as it was before him.

27．"And when I came up here with father, she kissed me, and told me to remember the Ninth Commandment, and that God would hear every word that I said."

28．"Do you believe this?" asked the judge, while a tear glistened in his eye, and his lip quivered with emotion.

29. "Yes, sir," said the child, with a voice and manner which showed that her conviction of the truth was perfect.

30. "God bless you, my child," said the judge, "you have a good mother. The witness is competent," he continued. "Were I on trial for my life, and innocent of the charge against me, I would pray God for such a witness as this. Let her be examined."

31. She told her story with the simplicity of a child, as she was; but her voice and manner carried conviction of her truthfulness to every heart.

32. The lawyers asked her many perplexing questions, but she did not vary in the least from her first statement.

33. The truth, as spoken by a little child, was sublime. Falsehood and perjury(8) had preceded her testimony; but before her testimony, falsehood was scattered like chaff(9).

34. The little child, for whom a mother had prayed for strength to be given her to speak the truth as it was before God, broke the cunning device of matured(10) villainy to pieces, like a potter's(11) vessel. The strength that her mother prayed for was given her; and the sublime and terrible simplicity,—terrible to the prisoner and his associates,—was like a revelation(12) from God himself.



(S. H. Hammond)



EXERCISES.—What is this story about? Why did the counsel wish to have Emily refused as a witness? Was she a fit person to be a witness? How was this shown? Which commandment forbids us to bear false witness? What was the result of Emily's testimony?

1．九岁的小女孩走上法庭，作为一个证人，她将要指证一个受审的罪犯，案件发生在她家里。

2．“现在，艾米莉，”罪犯的辩护律师说，“你了解誓言的本质吗？”

3．“我不懂你说的是什么意思，”小女孩简单地回答。

4．“法官大人，”律师对法官说，“显然应该驳回这个证人，她不了解誓言的本质。”

5．“让我们看一看，”法官说，“到这儿来，我的女儿。”

6．法官善良的语气和态度鼓励了小女孩，她走向他，自信地看着他，眼神平静、清澈，态度天真、诚恳，打动人心。

7．“你起过誓吗？”法官询问。

8．小女孩后退了一步，显得很震惊；血液涌上来，脸和脖子都涨红了，回答道：“没有，先生。”她以为法官在问她是否说过亵渎神的话。

9．“我不是那个意思，”看到她误会了，法官说，“我的意思是你是否做过证人？”

10．“没有，先生；我以前从没来过法庭。”小女孩回答说。

11．法官递给她一本打开的《圣经》。“你知道这本书吗，我的女儿？”

12．她看了看，回答道：“是的，先生；这是《圣经》。”

13．“你读过吗？”他问。

14．“是的，先生；每天早晨。”

15．“能告诉我什么是《圣经》吗？”法官问道。

16．“这是伟大的神的话，”她回答。

17．“那么，”法官说，“把手放到《圣经》上，听我说。”然后他缓慢而严肃地重复着以下的誓词，“你发誓你在为本案提供证据时，只讲真话，而且请求上帝帮助你吗？”

18．“我发誓，”她回答说。

19．“现在，”法官说，“你已经宣誓做证人了；你能告诉我如果你讲的不是真话会发生什么吗？”

20．“我将被关入州监狱，”孩子回答。

21．“别的呢？”法官问。

22．“我将永远不能去天堂了，”她回答。

23．“你怎么知道的？”法官又问。

24．孩子拿起《圣经》，迅速翻到有关“十诫”那一章，指着其中一节，上面写着：“你们不应该做伪证，陷害你们的邻居。”孩子说：“我识字前就知道了。”

25．“有人和你谈过在法庭上作证揭发这个人吗？”法官询问道。

26．“是的，先生，”她回答，“我妈妈听说要让我做证人；昨晚把我叫到她的房间，让我告诉她“十诫”的内容；然后我们一起向神祷告，她让我知道做伪证陷害邻居是邪恶的，她祷告上帝保佑我，要我讲实话，就好像在上帝面前一样。”

27．“当我和爸爸来这里的时候，妈妈亲了我，告诉我一定要记得第九诫的内容，她说我说的每个字上帝都能听到。”

28．“你相信吗？”法官问，眼中含着晶莹的泪珠，嘴唇因激动而发颤。

29．“是的，先生，”孩子说，声音和态度显示她确信无疑。

30．“上帝保佑你，我的孩子，”法官说，“你有个好母亲。作为证人你是胜任的，”他继续说，“如果是我无辜受审，我也会祷告上帝派给我这样一个证人。你们可以询问她了。”

31．因为她就是个孩子，她用孩子的方式简单叙述了她看到的经过，可是她的声音和态度令每个人从心里对她的话没有丝毫疑问。

32．律师问了很多迷惑人的问题，可是她的陈述始终是一致的。

33．正如孩子所说，真相是崇高的。在她之前有人说谎和做伪证；可是在她的证言面前，谎言就像谷皮一样消散了。

34．这个小孩子，她的母亲曾经为她祷告，使她拥有讲真话的力量，就好像在上帝面前讲话一样，把某些成年人狡猾编织的罪恶击成了碎片，就像打破陶器一样。她拥有了母亲向神祷告祈求的力量，而她那崇高却可怕的简洁话语——对犯人和他的同伙来说是可怕的——就像神的启示一样。

LESSON 75

KING SOLOMON AND THE ANTS

所罗门王和蚂蚁


By John Greenleaf Whittier, born near Haverhill, Mass., In 1807, and died at Hampton Falls, N. H., In 1892. Until he was eighteen years old he worked on the farm, and during that time learned the trade of at a shoemaker. He afterwards became an editor, and one of the first poets of America.

1．Out from Jerusalem

The king rode with his great

War chiefs and lords of state,

And Sheba's queen with them.

2．Proud in the Syrian sun,

In gold and purple sheen,

The dusky Ethiop queen

Smiled on King Solomon.

3．Wisest of men, he knew

The languages of all

The creatures great or small

That trod the earth or flew.

4．Across an ant-hill led

The king's path, and he heard

Its small folk, and their word

He thus interpreted(1):

5．"Here comes the king men greet(2)

As wise and good and just,

To crush us in the dust

Under his heedless feet."

6．The great king bowed his head,

And saw the wide surprise

Of the Queen of Sheba's eyes

As he told her what they said.

7．"O king!" she whispered sweet,

"Too happy fate have they

Who perish in thy way

Beneath thy gracious feet!

8．"Thou of the God-lent crown,

Shall these vile creatures dare

Murmur against thee where

The knees of kings kneel down?"

9．"Nay," Solomon replied,

"The wise and strong should seek

The welfare(3) of the weak;"

And turned his horse aside.

10．His train(4), with quick alarm,

Curved with their leader round

The ant-hill's peopled mound,

And left it free from harm.

11．The jeweled head bent low;

"O king!" she said, "henceforth

The secret of thy worth

And wisdom well I know.

12．Happy must be the State

Whose ruler heedeth more

The murmurs of the poor

Than flatteries(5) of the great."

1．从耶路撒冷城，

国王跃马而出

带着军官和领主，

还有示巴女王。

2．在叙利亚的阳光下，

披着金色和紫色华服，

高傲的示巴女王，

微笑地凝视着所罗门王。

3．所有人中他是最聪明的，

懂所有的语言，

不论大小生物，

不论飞禽走兽。

4．国王在路上，

经过一处蚁丘，

听到小蚂蚁交谈，

他懂得它们是这么说的：

5．“令人爱戴的王来了，

他聪明，善良又正直

可是却要无情地

把我们踩在脚下了。”

6．国王把蚂蚁的话，

转述给示巴女王，

低头他看见，

她眼中露出的惊讶。

7．“哦，王！”她甜蜜地低语，

“他们真幸运，

即使牺牲，

也要牺牲在你光荣的脚下。”

8．“你的王位是神赋予的，

所有的王向你跪拜，

这些卑微的小动物，

竟敢对你嘀嘀咕咕？”

9．“不，”所罗门王回答，

“智慧和强大的人

应为弱者谋福利；”

于是调转马头。

10．并告知随从保持警觉，

随他一起绕过蚁丘，

不能让蚁丘的蚂蚁，

受到丝毫伤害。

11．戴着无数珠宝的女王，

低头说，“噢，王，

我终于明白了人的价值

和智慧的秘密。”

12．“君主关心穷人疾苦，

胜过权贵的奉承，

生活在这个国家的人，

他们是有福的。”

LESSON 76

RIVERMOUTH THEATER

河口剧场


From "The Story of a Bad Boy," by Thomas Bailey Aldrich. The author was born at Portsmouth, N. H., in 1836. When quite young his family moved to Louisiana, but he was sent back to New England to be educated, and later he located at New York. He is a well-known writer of both prose and poetry.



1．"Now, boys, what shall we do?" I asked, addressing a thoughtful conclave(1) of seven, assembled in our barn one dismal, rainy afternoon. "Let's have a theater," suggested Binny Wallace.

2．The very thing! But where? The loft of the stable was ready to burst with hay provided for Gypsy, but the long room over the carriage house was unoccupied. The place of all places! My managerial(2) eye saw at a glance its capabilities for a theater.

3．I had been to the play a great many times in New Orleans, and was wise in matters pertaining to the drama. So here, in due time, was set up some extraordinary scenery of my own painting. The curtain, I recollect, though it worked smoothly enough on other occasions, invariably hitched during the performances.

4．The theater, however, was a success, as far as it went. I retired from the business with no fewer than fifteen hundred pins, after deducting(3) the headless, the pointless, and the crooked pins with which our doorkeeper frequently got "stuck." From first to last we took in a great deal of this counterfeit money. The price of admission to the "Rivermouth Theater" was twenty pins. I played all the principal characters myself—not that I was a finer actor than the other boys, but because I owned the establishment.

5．At the tenth representation, my dramatic career(4) was brought to a close by an unfortunate circumstance. We were playing the drama of "William Tell, the Hero of Switzerland." Of course I was William Tell, in spite of Fred Langdon, who wanted to act that character himself. I wouldn't let him, so he withdrew from the company, taking the only bow and arrow we had.

6．I made a crossbow out of a piece of whalebone, and did very well without him. We had reached that exciting scene where Gesler, the Austrian tyrant, commands Tell to shoot the apple from his son's head. Pepper Whitcomb, who played all the juvenile and women parts, was my son.

7．To guard against mischance, a piece of pasteboard was fastened by a handkerchief over the upper portion of Whitcomb's face, while the arrow to be used was sewed up in a strip of flannel. I was a capital marksman, and the big apple, only two yards distant, turned its russet cheek fairly towards me.



8．I can see poor little Pepper now, as he stood without flinching, waiting for me to perform my great feat. I raised the crossbow amid the breathless silence of the crowded audience(5)—consisting of seven boys and three girls, exclusive of Kitty Collins, who insisted on paying her way in with a clothespin. I raised the crossbow, I repeat. Twang! went the whipcord; but, alas! instead of hitting the apple, the arrow flew right into Pepper Whitcomb's mouth, which happened to be open at the time, and destroyed my aim.

9．I shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory. Pepper's roar, expressive of astonishment, indignation, and pain, is still ringing in my ears. I looked upon him as a corpse, and, glancing not far into the dreary future, pictured myself led forth to execution(6) in the presence of the very same spectators then assembled.

10．Luckily, poor Pepper was not seriously hurt; but Grandfather Nutter, appearing in the midst of the confusion (attracted by the howls of young Tell), issued an injunction(7) against all theatricals thereafter, and the place was closed; not, however, without a farewell speech from me, in which I said that this would have been the proudest moment of my life if I hadn't hit Pepper Whitcomb in the mouth. Whereupon the audience (assisted, I am glad to state, by Pepper) cried, "Hear! hear!"

11．I then attributed(8) the accident to Pepper himself, whose mouth, being open at the instant I fired, acted upon the arrow much after the fashion of a whirlpool, and drew in the fatal shaft. I was about to explain how a comparatively small maelstrom(9) could suck in the largest ship, when the curtain fell of its own accord, amid the shouts of the audience.

12．This was my last appearance on any stage. It was some time, though, before I heard the end of the William Tell business. Malicious little boys who hadn't been allowed to buy tickets to my theater used to cry out after me in the street,—"’Who killed Cock Robin?’"

选自《顽童故事》，作者托马斯·贝里·奥尔德里奇，1836年生于新罕布什尔州的朴次茅斯市，很小的时候，全家移居路易斯安那州，他回到新英格兰接受教育，后来移居纽约。他是著名的诗歌和散文作家。



1．“现在，孩子们，咱们做点什么呢？”一个阴霾的雨天的下午，我问七个聚集在我家谷仓的男孩子。“我们办个剧场吧，”宾尼·华莱士建议道。

2．好主意！可是剧场在哪里？谷仓阁楼堆满了给马准备的干草，但马车库对面还有空地。这个地方最合适！我用主办人的眼光扫视了一下，看能不能改造成剧场。

3．我多次去过新奥尔良的剧院，对于排戏这类事情无所不知。因此，我制作了绝妙的道具。可是幕布尽管做别的用途时一直很顺滑，演出时却被钩住了。

4．尽管如此，到目前为止，剧场的一切都很顺利。我最后收获了一千五百多枚钉子，还有很多没有帽、没有尖或弯曲的，剧场的看门人拿这些钉子也毫无办法。从始至终，我们收到了不少这种“假币”。入场费是二十枚钉子。我自己扮演了所有的主要角色——不是因为我更优秀，只是因为我是剧场的主人。

5．第十场演出时发生了意外，我的舞台生涯也随之结束了。当时我们正在演出《瑞士英雄威廉·退尔》。当然，威廉·退尔由我扮演，尽管弗雷德·兰登也觊觎这个角色。我没有让他演，他愤怒地退出了剧场，带走了唯一的弓箭。

6．我用鲸须另外做了一张弓，因此没有弗雷德·兰登也能演下去。演到奥地利暴君格斯勒命令威廉·退尔箭射放在自己儿子头上的苹果了。剧中扮演孩子的是佩珀·惠特科姆，他包揽了所有儿童和女性角色。

7．为了防止意外，惠特科姆面部上方用手帕包了一块纸板挡着，箭头也用法兰绒布条缝了起来。我是个神射手，而金黄色的大苹果离我只有二码远。

8．我看到小佩珀站在那儿，毫无畏惧地等着我的壮举。观众包括七个男孩和三个女孩，还有基蒂·克林斯，因为她坚持用衣夹支付入场费。我拉了两次弓。砰！弓弦响了；哎呀！箭没有射中苹果，笔直飞入惠特科姆张开的嘴里。

9．我永远不会忘记那可怕的一刻。佩珀嚎叫着，充满吃惊、愤怒和痛苦，这声音至今还回响在我的耳边。我像看一具尸体一样看着他，同时想象着在不久的将来，我当着这些人的面被处决。

10．幸运的是，可怜的佩珀伤势并不重。混乱中爷爷努特出现了（被小退尔的嚎叫吸引来的），下令从此停止一切演出，剧场关闭了。我没忘发表告别演说，我说如果不是射中了佩珀·惠特科姆的嘴，这一定是我一生中最骄傲的时刻。对此，观众（我得说，佩珀起了不小的作用）喊叫起来：“听！听！”

11．后来我把过错归于佩珀自己，我射击的时候，他大张的嘴像旋涡一样，把箭吸了进去。在观众的喊叫声中，我正要解释小旋涡是怎么吸进大船的，舞台的幕布自己掉了下来。

12．这是我最后一次和舞台沾边。可是很久以后人们还会提到威廉·退尔。未获准买票进入剧场的小孩子们心怀恶意，常常在我身后喊——“谁杀死了知更鸟?”

LESSON 77

ALFRED THE GREAT

阿尔弗雷德大帝


1．More than a thousand years ago, (in the year 849), a prince was born in England, who afterwards became one of the most celebrated and best loved kings in the world. His name was Alfred—afterwards called Alfred the Great—and he was the favorite son both of the king and queen.

2．In those days the common people were very ignorant; few of them could even read and write. There were no schools, and the monasteries(1), where almost the only teaching had been done, were nearly all destroyed in the wars which were continually going on. Only the higher classes had any chance to study, and even they paid much more attention to fighting than tostudying.

3．But Alfred was different from most persons of his time. Even when a little boy, he delighted in listening to poems and to the ballads which harpers used to sing, and he learned many of them by heart. When he was twelve years old, his mother, the queen, offered to give a volume of poems to that one of her four sons who would first learn to read it. Alfred was the youngest of them all, yet he easily won the prize of which his brothers thought so little.

4．But, as has been said, these were stirring times, and Alfred was soon called on to show his great abilities as a soldier. The Danes, a warlike people, were continually swooping down in their vessels upon the coast of England. Often they spread over the entire country, plundering and burning the towns, and killing the people.

5．In the midst of these invasions(2) Alfred became king, when he was only twenty-two years old. He proved as good a warrior as he was a student. He thought that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well. He was generally successful against the Danes, but at one time they seemed to have the country entirely in their power, and Alfred was compelled to hide for his life.

6．For some time he dressed as a peasant, and lived in the cottage of a cowherd, who was so careful of his king's safety that he did not even tell his wife who he was. So she treated the king as a common peasant, and one day gave him a sharp scolding because he allowed some cakes to burn on the griddle, after she had left him to watch them. She told him he was clever enough at eating cakes though he managed so badly at baking them.

7．When the search for him grew less active, Alfred gradually collected some of his followers, with whom he encamped on a small spot of firm ground in the center of a bog. It was surrounded by almost impassable forests, and Alfred fortified the place so that it could not well be taken. Then he made frequent sudden and successful attacks on the enemy until his troops and the people became encouraged.

8．One victory in particular, when they captured a banner which the Danes thought enchanted, led Alfred to take bolder steps. He wished to find out the exact condition of the enemy, and, for this purpose, disguised(3) himself as a harper and entered their camp. He was so successful in his disguise that he remained there some days, even being admitted to the tent of the Danish leader Guthrum.

9．He found their entire army living in careless security, and so he determined to make a sudden and bold attack on them, to try and rid his country once more of these cruel invaders. He summoned his people about him from far and wide. Many of them had long thought their beloved king dead, but now all eagerly obeyed his call.

10．He at once led them against that part of the camp which he had seen to be most unguarded. The attack was entirely unexpected; and, although the Danes were greater in numbers, they were defeated with great slaughter. Some of them, with their leader, fled to a fortified place, but were soon obliged to surrender.

11．Alfred granted them their lives, and settled them in a part of his kingdom where nearly all his own people had been destroyed. He hoped by this to change obstinate enemies into useful friends who would protect England from further attacks of their own countrymen. However, some years later, when the Danes made another invasion, these people joined them in fighting against Alfred, but he soon succeeded in driving them all out of the country.

12．Much as Alfred did for his people in war, he did more in time of peace. Above all else he gave careful attention to their education. He rebuilt the monasteries and aided the young University(4) of Oxford. He also founded many schools, to which every owner of a certain portion of land was compelled to send his children.

13．But he did as much good by the example that he set as by these acts. His time was divided into three parts. One was given to business, one to refreshment by sleep and food, and the third to study and devotion. Clocks and watches, and probably even sundials, were then unknown, so these divisions were marked by burning candles of equal lengths.

14．Alfred did not study for his own pleasure merely, but translated(5) and wrote many works for the good of his people, using the simple language which they could easily understand and enjoy. His person was handsome and dignified, full of grace and activity. But the more noble beauty was within, in the enlightened(6) mind and virtuous heart of the king. After his name, which has its place on an ancient record of English kings, is written the noble title of "Truth Teller."

1．一千多年以前（公元849年），一个王子在英格兰出生了，他后来成为世界上最著名最受人爱戴的国王之一。他的名字叫阿尔弗雷德——后来人们称他为阿尔弗雷德大帝——他是国王和王后最喜爱的儿子。

2．当时人们都很无知，没有几个人会读会写。没有学校，修道院是当时人们受教育的唯一场所，但几乎也都毁于绵延不断的战火中。只有贵族有机会接受教育，即使是他们，关注战争的时间也超过学习的时间。

3．可是阿尔弗雷德与同时代的大部分人不同。还是小孩子的时候，他就喜欢听竖琴师演唱诗歌和民谣，而且很多都记在了心里。十二岁的时候，他的母后拿出一卷诗歌，对她的四个儿子说，谁最快学会阅读，就把这卷诗歌奖励给他。阿尔弗雷德年龄最小，可是他轻松赢得了奖励，而他的哥哥们都心不在焉。

4．可是，就像前面说的那样，那是个兵荒马乱的年代，阿尔弗雷德很快入伍成为战士。好战的丹麦人，不断乘船袭击英格兰的海岸。他们常常席卷全国，烧杀抢掠。

5．在战火中，年仅二十三岁的阿尔弗雷德成为国王。他不但是个好学者，也是个好战士。他认为不论什么事，只要值得做就应当做好。在对抗丹麦人的战争中他打了不少胜仗，但是有一个时期丹麦人似乎控制了整个英格兰，阿尔弗雷德被迫躲藏起来。

6．阿尔弗雷德一度装扮成农民，住在一个牧民家里，牧民对国王的安全小心谨慎，即使对他的妻子也没透露。因此牧民的妻子对国王就像对待普通的农民一样，有一天还狠狠责备了他，因为他照看的蛋糕烤糊了。牧民的妻子对他说，你吃蛋糕的本事可比烤蛋糕强多了。

7．当丹麦人放松对他的搜捕的时候，阿尔弗雷德渐渐聚拢起一些追随者，他们驻扎在沼泽中心一小块结实的平地上。四周都是密林，难以通过，加之阿尔弗雷德构筑了防御工事，因此易守难攻。他频繁地袭击敌人，都很成功，军队和人民很受鼓舞。

8．在一次胜利中，他们夺取了一面丹麦人认为施了魔法的旗帜，这促使阿尔弗雷德采取更大胆的行动。他希望准确地了解敌人的情况，因此，他假扮成竖琴师，混进了敌营。他伪装得很成功，在敌营住了很多天，甚至还得到允许进入了丹麦首领古特伦的营帐。

9．他发现丹麦军队纪律松弛，因此决定对他们采取大胆的突袭，把这些残酷的侵略者赶出英格兰。他召集远近的人民。很多人原以为他们热爱的国王已经死了，现在纷纷响应他的命令。

10．他带领军队袭击了敌人防备最松弛的部位。尽管人数众多，丹麦人却毫无准备，吃了败仗，死伤惨重。他们的领袖带着一部分人逃到一个堡垒，可是很快就不得不投降了。

11．阿尔弗雷德饶了他们的命，把他们安置在王国的一块地方，这里原来的居民几乎都死于战争中。他希望这样做能够改变顽固的敌人，把他们变成有用的朋友，在其他丹麦人侵犯时保卫英格兰。可是，几年后，当丹麦人再次侵略英格兰的时候，这些人加入了他们，与阿尔弗雷德作战，但阿尔弗雷德很快把他们都赶出了英格兰。

12．就像在战争时期保卫国家一样，阿尔弗雷德在和平时期也为本国人做了很多事。他尤其重视教育，重修了修道院，资助了新建的牛津大学。还开办了很多学校，所有拥有土地的人都必须把孩子送去学习。

13．不仅如此，他更以身作则。他把时间分成三块。一块用于商业，一块用于日常的睡眠和进食，第三块用于学习和宗教活动。钟表，甚至日晷在当时也不为人所知，因此这三块时间是通过点燃相同长度的蜡烛表示的。

14．阿尔弗雷德不仅仅因为喜爱而学习，更为了让人民受益，他用简单易懂、生动优美的语言翻译和写作了很多作品。他长相英俊、态度庄重、举止优雅、充满活力。可是他最崇高的美存在于心灵里，表现为开明的头脑和高贵的品德。作为古代英国国王，他名垂青史，在他的名字后面，写着“讲真话的人”。

LESSON 78

LIVING ON A FARM

农场生活


1．How brightly through the mist of years,

My quiet country home appears!

My father busy all the day

In plowing corn or raking hay;

My mother moving with delight

Among the milk pans, silver-bright;

We children, just from school set free,

Filling the garden with our glee.

The blood of life was flowing warm

When I was living on a farm.

2．I hear the sweet churchgoing bell,

As o'er the fields its music fell,

I see the country neighbors round

Gathering beneath the pleasant sound;

They stop awhile beside the door,

To talk their homely matters o'er—

The springing corn, the ripening grain,

And "how we need a little rain;"

"A little sun would do no harm,

We want good weather for the farm."

3．When autumn came, what joy to see

The gathering of the husking bee,

To hear the voices keeping tune,

Of girls and boys beneath the moon,

To mark the golden corn ears bright,

More golden in the yellow light!

Since I have learned the ways of men,

I often turn to these again,

And feel life wore its highest charm.

When I was living on the farm.

1．如烟岁月中清晰呈现，

儿时的故乡，安静的乡村！

爸爸整日忙忙碌碌，

犁着玉米地，或打干草，

妈妈在亮银色的奶锅旁，

开心地忙前忙后；

放学后我们小孩子们，

在菜园里欢声笑语。

我在农场生活的时候，

流淌着温暖的盎然生机。

2．钟声召唤人们去教堂，

声音悦耳响彻原野，

美妙的钟声下面，

渐渐聚拢起村民，

他们在门旁逗留，

谈着各自的大事小情——

玉米蹿高了，谷子在成熟，

“要是下场小雨就好了”

“多点日光也不赖，

农场需要好气候。”

3．秋天是多么快乐，

参加剥玉米壳聚会，

月光下少男少女，

轻声低语。

月光下金黄玉米穗，

闪闪发光。

越是长大成人，

越是喜欢回顾，

在农场度过的日子，

生活是那么富有魅力。





LESSON 79

HUGH IDLE AND MR. TOIL

休·伊德和特劳先生


Adapted from the story of "Little Daffydowndilly," by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The author was born at Salem, Mass., in 1804, and ranks among the first of American novelists. He died in 1864.



1．Hugh Idle loved to do only what was agreeable(1), and took no delight in labor of any kind. But while Hugh was yet a little boy, he was sent away from home, and put under the care of a very strict schoolmaster, who went by the name of Mr. Toil.

2．Those who knew him best, affirmed(2) that Mr. Toil was a very worthy character, and that he had done more good, both to children and grown people, than anybody else in the world. He had, however, a severe and ugly countenance; his voice was harsh; and all his ways and customs were disagreeable to our young friend, Hugh Idle.

3．The whole day long this terrible old schoolmaster stalked about among his scholars, with a big cane in his hand; and unless a lad chose to attend constantly and quietly to his book, he had no chance of enjoying a single quiet moment. "This will never do for me," thought Hugh; "I'll run off, and try to find my way home."

4．So the very next morning off he started, with only some bread and cheese for his breakfast, and very little pocket money to pay his expenses(3). He had gone but a short distance, when he overtook a man of grave and sedate(4) appearance trudging at a moderate(5) pace along the road.

5．"Good morning, my fine lad!" said the stranger; and his voice seemed hard and severe, yet had a sort of kindness in it; "whence do you come so early, and whither are you going?"

6．Now Hugh was a boy of very frank disposition(6), and had never been known to tell a lie in all his life. Nor did he tell one now, but confessed(7) that he had run away from school on account of his great dislike to Mr. Toil. "Oh, very well, my little friend!" answered the stranger; "then we will go together; for I likewise have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil, and should be glad to find some place where he was never heard of." So they walked on very sociably(8) side by side.

7．By and by their road led them past a field, where some haymakers were at work. Hugh could not help thinking how much pleasanter it must be to make hay in the sunshine, under the blue sky, than to learn lessons all day long, shut up in a dismal schoolroom, continually watched by Mr. Toil.

8．But in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping to peep over the stone wall, he started back and caught hold of his companion's hand. "Quick, quick!" cried he; "let us run away, or he will catch us!"

9．"Who will catch us?" asked the stranger.

10．"Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster," answered Hugh; "don't you see him among the haymakers?" and Hugh pointed to an elderly man, who seemed to be the owner of the field.

11．He was busily at work in his shirt sleeves. The drops of sweat stood upon his brow; and he kept constantly crying out to his work people to make hay while the sun shone. Strange to say, the features(9) of the old farmer were precisely the same as those of Mr. Toil, who at that very moment must have been just entering the schoolroom.

12．"Don't be afraid," said the stranger; "this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was bred a farmer. He won't trouble you, unless you become a laborer on his farm."

13．Hugh believed what his companion said, but was glad when they were out of sight of the old farmer who bore such a singular resemblance(10) to Mr. Toil. The two travelers came to a spot where some carpenters were building a house. Hugh begged his companion to stop awhile, for it was a pretty sight to see how neatly the carpenters did their work with their saws, planes, and hammers; and he was beginning to think he too should like to use the saw, and the plane, and the hammer, and be a carpenter himself. But suddenly he caught sight of something that made him seize his friend's hand, in a great fright.

14．"Make haste! quick, quick!" cried he; "there's old Mr. Toil again." The stranger cast his eyes where Hugh pointed his finger, and saw an elderly man, who seemed to be overseeing the carpenters, as he went to and fro about the unfinished house, marking out the work to be done, and urging the men to be diligent(11); and wherever he turned his hard and wrinkled visage(12), they sawed and hammered as if for dear life.

15．"Oh, no! this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster," said the stranger; "it is another brother of his who follows the trade of carpenter."

16．"I am very glad to hear it," quoth(13) Hugh; "but if you please, sir, I should like to get out of his way as soon as possible."

选编自《小水仙》，作者纳撒尼尔·霍桑，1804年生于马萨诸塞州的萨勒姆镇，是美国最早的小说家之一，864年去世。



1．休·伊德只喜欢做使他感到惬意的事，不喜欢任何劳动。休虽然还很小，却被送到了严厉的教师特劳先生那里学习。

2．了解特劳先生的人都说他是个值得敬重的人，他为孩子，也为成年人所做的事比世界上任何人都多。可是他表情严肃，长相丑陋，说话的声音严厉；他的所有方式和习惯都让我们的小朋友休·伊德感到不快。

3．手里拿着一根大竹杖，这个可怕的老师对孩子们非常严厉；除非安静专心致志地读书，否则将得不到一刻消停。“这对我来说可不行，”休心里想，“我得逃回家去。”

4．第二天早上他就出发了，只带了一些用作早餐的面包奶酪和一点零花钱。刚走不远，他就遇到了一个表情严肃、走在路上稳稳当当的人。

5．“早上好，我的好孩子！”陌生人说。他的声音生硬、严肃，可是透着善良，“你怎么这么早？你去哪儿呀？”

6．休是个性格坦率的男孩，从来没撒过谎。他坦诚地说他是从学校逃出来的，因为非常不喜欢特劳先生。“哦，很好，我的小朋友！”陌生人回答说，“那么我们一起走吧；因为我也受不了特劳先生，我们得找一个谁也没听说过他的地方。”于是，他们友好地一起往前走。

7．经过一片田野，一些人在那里晾干草。休不禁想，在蓝天下阳光里晾干草也比整天关在阴暗的教室里学习功课快乐多了，又没有特劳先生一直监视。

8．一边想一边透过石墙的缝隙往里看，一看之下，不禁吃了一惊，抓住同伴的手。“快，快！”他喊道，“我们逃跑吧，否则他会抓住我们的！”

9．“谁抓我们？”陌生人说。

10．“特劳先生，老校长，”休回答说，“你在晾干草的人中没看到他吗？”休指着一个老人，好像是这片地的主人。

11．那个人挽着袖子在干活。额头上汗水涔涔，他不停地对工人们喊叫，趁着天晴赶快晾干草。说起来，这个老农民的相貌和特劳先生一模一样，此刻，特劳先生一定刚走进教室。

12．“不要害怕，”陌生人说，“这不是特劳校长，而是他的一个当农民的兄弟。除非你是他农场的工人，否则他不会找你麻烦的。”

13．休相信同伴说的话，很高兴地离开了这个和特劳先生长相惊人相似的人。两人来到了一个地方，那里木匠们正在盖房子。休求同伴等一会，木匠们用他们的锯、刨子、锤子利索地干活的情景很有趣；他开始想象也想拿起那些锯、刨子、锤子，成为一名木匠。可是突然，他看到了什么，害怕地抓住朋友的手。

14．“快点！快，快！”休叫起来，“又看到老特劳了。”休用手指着，陌生人顺着手指的方向看去，一个老年人似乎是监工，他走来走去，给要做的工作做着标记，督促人们更用力气；严肃而布满皱纹的脸在哪里出现，那里的木匠们就都拼命地工作。

15．“哦，不！这不是特劳校长，”陌生人说，“这是他的从事木匠工作的另一个兄弟。”

16．“听见你这么说我就放心了，”休说，“可是，先生，我想尽快离开这儿。”

LESSON 80

HUGH IDLE AND MR. TOIL (CONCLUDED)

休·伊德和特劳先生（结束篇）


1．Now Hugh and the stranger had not gone much further, when they met a company of soldiers, gayly dressed, with feathers in their caps, and glittering muskets on their shoulders. In front marched the drummers and fifers, making such merry music that Hugh would gladly have followed them to the end of the world. If he were only a soldier, he said to himself, old Mr. Toil would never venture(1) to look him in the face.

2．"Quickstep! forward! march!" shouted a gruff voice.

3．Little Hugh started in great dismay(2); for this voice sounded precisely(3) like that which he had heard every day in Mr. Toil's schoolroom. And turning his eyes to the captain of the company, what should he see but the very image of old Mr. Toil himself, in an officer's dress, to be sure, but looking as ugly and disagreeable as ever.

4．"This is certainly old Mr. Toil," said Hugh, in a trembling voice. "Let us away, for fear he should make us enlist(4) in his company."

5．"You are mistaken again, my little friend," replied the stranger very composedly(5). "This is only a brother of Mr. Toil's, who has served in the army all his life. You and I need not be afraid of him."

6．"Well, well," said Hugh, "if you please, sir, I don't want to see the soldiers any more." So the child and the stranger resumed(6) their journey; and, after awhile, they came to a house by the roadside, where a number of young men and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their faces, were dancing to the sound of a fiddle.

7．"Oh, let us stop here," cried Hugh; "Mr. Toil will never dare to show his face where there is a fiddler, and where people are dancing and making merry."

8．But the words had scarcely died away on the little boy's tongue, when, happening to cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should he behold again but the likeness of Mr. Toil, armed with a fiddle bow this time, and flourishing it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had been a fiddler all his life.

9．"Oh, dear me!" whispered he, turning pale; "it seems as if there were nobody but Mr. Toil in the world."

10．"This is not your old schoolmaster," observed(7) the stranger, "but another brother of his, who has learned to be a fiddler. He is ashamed of his family, and generally calls himself Master Pleasure; but his real name is Toil, and those who know him best think him still more disagreeable than his brothers."

11．"Pray, let us go on," said Hugh.

12．Well, thus the two went wandering along the highway and in shady lanes and through pleasant villages, and wherever they went, behold! there was the image of old Mr. Toil. If they entered a house, he sat in the parlor; if they peeped into the kitchen, he was there! He made himself at home in every cottage, and stole, under one disguise or another, into the most splendid mansions. Everywhere they stumbled on some of the old schoolmaster's innumerable(8) brothers.

13．At length, little Hugh found himself completely worn out with running away from Mr. Toil. "Take me back! take me back!" cried the poor fellow, bursting into tears. "If there is nothing but Toil all the world over, I may just as well go back to the schoolhouse."

14．"Yonder it is; there is the schoolhouse!" said the stranger; for though he and little Hugh had taken a great many steps, they had traveled in a circle instead of a straight line. "Come, we will go back to the school together."

15．There was something in his companion's voice that little Hugh now remembered; and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner. Looking up into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old Mr. Toil, so that the poor child had been in company with Toil all day, even while he had been doing his best to run away from him.

16．Little Hugh Idle, however, had learned a good lesson, and from that time forward was diligent at his task, because he now knew that diligence is not a whit more toilsome than sport or idleness. And when he became better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began to think his ways were not so disagreeable, and that the old schoolmaster's smile of approbation(9) made his face sometimes appear almost as pleasant as even that of Hugh's mother.



EXERCISES.—To whose school was Hugh Idle sent? Why did he run away? Relate the adventures of Hugh and the stranger. What lesson is taught by this story?

1．休和陌生人没走多远，看见一队士兵，衣着华丽，帽子上插着羽毛，肩膀上扛着闪闪发光的毛瑟枪。队伍前面走着鼓手和吹横笛的人，听着欢快的音乐，休心里想，就是跟着他们到天涯海角也行。如果当个士兵，老特劳先生永远也不敢朝他看了。

2．“快步走！齐步走！踏步走！”一个粗哑的声音喊道。

3．休吓了一跳，这个声音听起来和特劳先生的声音完全一样。再看领队，竟然是特劳先生本人，穿着军官的服装，可是看起来和以前一样又丑又不令人愉快。

4．“这肯定是老特劳先生，”休声音颤抖地说道，“我们走吧，我害怕他会让我们参加他的军队。”

5．“你又错了，我的小朋友，”陌生人沉着地回答，“这只是特劳先生的一个兄弟，他一生都在军队里。你用不着怕他。”

6．“好吧，好吧，”休说，“先生，求您了，我不想再看这些士兵。”于是休和陌生人继续他们的旅行，不久，他们看到路边有一户人家，几个少年和一个脸色红扑扑的女孩，正随着小提琴的演奏起舞。

7．“噢，我们就在这儿，”休大声说，“有小提琴手，有人跳舞享乐的地方，特劳先生永远不敢露面的。”

8．可是话还没说完，休的眼光正好落在小提琴师身上，竟然是特劳先生！这次他轻松熟练地舞动着提琴弓，好像他一生都是小提琴手。

9．“哎呀，天啊！”休小声说，面色惨白，“世界上除了特劳先生好像没有别人了。”

10．“这不是你的老校长，”陌生人看了看说，“这是他的另一个兄弟，他是个小提琴手。他为家庭感到难为情，通常称自己是快乐大师；可是他的真名是特劳，认识他的人觉得他比他的兄弟们更令人不快。”

11．“天啊，我们快走吧。”休说。

12．两人继续向前走，走过大路，穿过林荫小路，经过美丽的村庄，可是不论走到哪儿，看啊！总有特劳先生的身影。如果他们走进一户人家，他坐在客厅里；如果向厨房窥视，他就在那里！在每个农舍或商店，或者在最金碧辉煌的大厦，都可以见到打扮不同的特劳先生。总之，不论在哪，他们都能撞上特劳先生无数兄弟中的某一个。

13．最后，休精疲力尽。“带我回去！带我回去！”可怜的小家伙喊着，满脸泪水。“如果世界上都是特劳，我回学校也是一样的。”

14．“学校就在那儿，学校就在那儿！”陌生人说。他和休虽然走了很久，却没有走直线，只是绕了一圈。“来，我们一起回学校吧。”

15．同伴的声音里有些东西让休想起了什么，很奇怪他没早点儿想起来。抬头看着同伴的脸，看！又是老特劳先生，可怜的孩子全天都和特劳先生在一起，他居然还拼命躲着他。

16．休学到了很好的一课，从这一刻开始，他勤奋学习，因为他现在明白了勤奋不比游戏或偷懒更辛苦。在对特劳先生有了更多了解后，开始觉得他并非那么令人讨厌，而老校长不时露出的赞赏的微笑几乎和妈妈的一样令人快乐。

LESSON 81

BURNING THE FALLOW

火　警


Adapted from "Roughing it in the Bush," a story by Mrs. Susanna Moodie (sister of Agnes Strickland), who was born in Suffolk, England, in 1803. She died in 1885.



1．The day was sultry, and towards noon a strong wind sprang up that roared in the pine tops like the dashing of distant billows, but without in the least degree abating(1) the heat. The children were lying listlessly(2) upon the floor, and the girl and I were finishing sunbonnets, when Mary suddenly exclaimed, "Bless us, mistress, what a smoke!"

2．I ran immediately to the door, but was not able to distinguish ten yards before me. The swamp immediately below us was on fire, and the heavy wind was driving a dense black cloud of smoke directly towards us.

3．"What can this mean?" I cried. "Who can have set fire to the fallow(3)?" As I ceased speaking, John Thomas stood pale and trembling before me. "John, what is the meaning of this fire?"

4．"Oh, ma'am, I hope you will forgive me; it was I set fire to it, and I would give all I have in the world if I had not done it."

5．"What is the danger?"

6．"Oh, I'm afraid that we shall all be burnt up," said John, beginning to whimper. "What shall we do?"

7．"Why, we must get out of it as fast as we can, and leave the house to its fate."

8．"We can't get out," said the man, in a low, hollow tone, which seemed the concentration(4) of fear; "I would have got out of it if I could; but just step to the back door, ma'am, and see."

9．Behind, before, on every side, we were surrounded by a wall of fire, burning furiously within a hundred yards of us, and cutting off all possibility of retreat; for, could we have found an opening through the burning heaps, we could not have seen our way through the dense canopy(5) of smoke; and, buried as we were in the heart of the forest, no one could discover our situation till we were beyond the reach of help.

10．I closed the door, and went back to the parlor. Fear was knocking loudly at my heart, for our utter helplessness destroyed all hope of our being able to effect(6) our escape. The girl sat upon the floor by the children, who, unconscious of the peril that hung over them, had both fallen asleep. She was silently weeping; while the boy who had caused the mischief was crying aloud.

11．A strange calm succeeded(7) my first alarm. I sat down upon the step of the door, and watched the awful scene in silence. The fire was raging in the cedar swamp immediately below the ridge on which the house stood, and it presented a spectacle truly appalling(8).

12．From out of the dense folds of a canopy of black smoke—the blackest I ever saw—leaped up red forks of lurid(9) flame as high as the tree tops, igniting(10) the branches of a group of tall pines that had been left for saw logs. A deep gloom blotted out the heavens from our sight. The air was filled with fiery particles, which floated even to the doorstep—while the crackling and roaring of the flames might have been heard at a great distance.

13．To reach the shore of the lake, we must pass through the burning swamp, and not a bird could pass over it with unscorched wings. The fierce wind drove the flames at the sides and back of the house up the clearing; and our passage to the road or to the forest, on the right and left, was entirely obstructed by a sea of flames. Our only ark of safety was the house, so long as it remained untouched by the fire.

14．I turned to young Thomas, and asked him how long he thought that would he. "When the fire clears this little ridge in front, ma'am. The Lord have mercy on us then, or we must all go."

15．I threw myself down on the floor beside my children, and pressed them to my heart, while inwardly I thanked God that they were asleep, unconscious of danger, and unable by their cries to distract(11) our attention from adopting any plan which might offer to effect their escape.

16．The heat soon became suffocating. We were parched(12) with thirst, and there was not a drop of water in the house, and none to be procured nearer than the lake. I turned once more to the door, hoping that a passage might have been burnt through to the water. I saw nothing but a dense cloud of fire and smoke—could hear nothing but the crackling and roaring of flames, which were gaining so fast upon us that I felt their scorching breath in my face.

17．"Ah," thought I—and it was a most bitter thought— "what will my beloved husband say when he returns and finds that his poor wife and his dear girls have perished in this miserable manner? But God can save us yet." 18．The thought had scarcely found a voice in my heart before the wind rose to a hurricane, scattering the flames on all sides into a tempest of burning billows. I buried my head in my apron, for I thought that all was lost, when a most terrific crash of thunder burst over our heads, and, like the breaking of a waterspout(13), down came the rushing torrent of rain which had been pent up for so many weeks.

19．In a few minutes the chip yard was all afloat, and the fire effectually checked. The storm which, unnoticed by us, had been gathering all day, and which was the only one of any note we had that summer, continued to rage all night, and before morning had quite subdued the cruel enemy whose approach we had viewed with such dread.

选自《丛林中的艰苦岁月》，作者苏姗娜·穆迪（艾格尼斯·斯特里克兰（Agnes Strickland）的妹妹），1803年生于英格兰的沙福克郡，1885年去世。



1．天气湿热，快到中午的时候，一阵大风在松树梢上呼啸而过，就像远方大海的滚滚波涛，可是天气一点也不见凉快。孩子们无精打采地躺在地板上，女孩和我在给遮阳帽收尾，突然玛莉喊叫起来：“上帝保佑，太太，怎么这么大的烟啊！”

2．我立刻跑向门边，眼前十码远的地方什么也看不见了。我们下面的沼泽地一片火海，大风正把大片的浓烟吹向我们。

3．“这意味着什么？”我喊道。“谁把休耕地点着了？”这时，约翰·托马斯脸色苍白颤抖地站到我面前。“约翰，这火意味着什么？”

4．“噢，太太，我希望你原谅我；是我放的火，真希望我没有这么做，为此让我放弃世界上的一切都愿意。”

5．“到底有什么危险？”

6．“哦，恐怕我们都会被烧死，”约翰说，开始啜泣，“我们该怎么办？”

7．“还能怎么办，我们必须尽快离开，房子只能听天由命了。”

8．“我们出不去了，”男孩说，声音低沉、空洞，似乎充满了恐惧；“如果能出去，我早就出去了；可是太太，你看看后门。”

9．后面，前面，每个方向，火墙把我们包围了，距离我们一百码的地方大火猛烈地燃烧着，切断了我们的退路。即使我们从熊熊火焰中找到缝隙，浓烟中我们也无法辨别方向，而且由于我们在森林的中心，谁也无法及时发现我们的状况。

10．我关上门，回到客厅。恐惧撞击着我的心，我们身处绝地，逃生无望。女孩站在孩子们旁边，孩子们对于面临的巨大危险一无所知，都已沉沉入睡。女孩悄悄地哭泣着，而造成这场危害的男孩子也不停地哭。

11．惊恐之后，我感到一种奇怪的平静。坐在门前的台阶上，我无声地观察着这可怕的情景。我们的房子坐落在山脊上，山脊下方的雪松沼泽里大火在迅速蔓延，情形确实令人震惊。

12．浓密的黑烟中火红的火舌跃起到树梢那么高，点燃了被留作锯材用的原木的枝干。天空被浓烟遮挡住了。空气中充满了炽热的颗粒，有些颗粒甚至漂到了门前的台阶上——而火焰的噼噼啪啪声和呼啸声从很远的地方也一定能听到。

13．要到达湖边，必须经过燃烧着的沼泽地，即使鸟儿飞过去也会烧焦翅膀。狂风吹动着火焰正越过门前空地，就要达到房子侧墙和后墙了；通向左侧的山路或右侧森林的路完全被火焰阻挡了。如果火焰没烧到房子，它就是我们唯一安全的方舟。

14．我转向小托马斯，问他需要多久会烧到房子。“当火烧光前面的小山脊，太太。到时候上帝保佑我们，我们都得走。”

15．我扑倒在地板上的孩子们身边，把他们紧紧抱在胸前，心里感谢上帝，他们还都熟睡着，不知道发生的危险，不会因为哭叫干扰我们，而我们计划着如何使他们躲过这一场浩劫。

16．热浪很快变得令人窒息。我们都口干舌燥，房子里没有一滴水，除非到湖边。我又朝门望去，希望看到已经烧出来一条到湖泊的路。可是除了浓浓的烟火以外，什么都看不见——除了火焰的噼噼啪啪声和呼啸声什么也听不见，火焰正迅速向我们逼近，我感到了脸上的焦烤。17．“噢，”带着苦涩，我想，“我可爱的丈夫返回时看到他可怜的妻子和可爱的女儿们这么痛苦地消失会怎么说呢？上帝会拯救我们的。”

18．我甚至还没来得及想，台风骤起，四周的火焰被台风吹得四散，就像燃烧的巨浪在翻滚。我把头埋在围裙里，心想一切都完了，这时头上响起了一声巨雷，就像水管裂开了，几周来酝酿着的大雨倾盆而下。

19．几分钟内，贮存场的木片就全漂浮了起来，大火得到了有效地遏制。我们没有注意到整天都在酝酿着暴雨，那是那个夏天的唯一一场雨，猛下了一晚，终于在黎明到来前制服了那曾经向我们袭来，让我们万分恐惧的残酷的敌人。

LESSON 82

THE DYING SOLDIERS

垂死的士兵


1．A waste of land, a sodden(1) plain,

A lurid sunset sky,

With clouds that fled and faded fast

In ghostly phantasy(2);

A field upturned by trampling feet,

A field uppiled with slain,

With horse and rider blent(3) in death

Upon the battle plain.

2．The dying and the dead lie low;

For them, no more shall rise

The evening moon, nor midnight stars,

Nor daylight's soft surprise:

They will not wake to tenderest call,

Nor see again each home,

Where waiting hearts shall throb and break,

When this day's tidings(4) come.

3．Two soldiers, lying as they fell

Upon the reddened clay—

In daytime, foes; at night, in peace

Breathing their lives away!

Brave hearts had stirred each manly breast;

Fate only, made them foes;

And lying, dying, side by side,

A softened feeling rose.

4．"Our time is short," one faint voice said;

"To-day we've done our best

On different sides: what matters now?

To-morrow we shall rest!

Life lies behind. I might not care

For only my own sake;

But far away are other hearts,

That this day's work will break.

5．"Among New Hampshire's snowy hills,

There pray for me to-night

A woman, and a little girl

With hair like golden light;"

And at the thought, broke forth, at last,

The cry of anguish(5) wild,

That would not longer be repressed(6)—

"O God, my wife, my child!"

6．"And," said the other dying man,

"Across the Georgia plain,

There watch and wait for me loved one

I ne'er shall see again:

A little girl, with dark, bright eyes,

Each day waits at the door;

Her father's step, her father's kiss,

Will never greet her more.

7．"To-day we sought each other's lives:

Death levels all that now;

For soon before God's mercy seat

Together we shall bow.

Forgive each other while we may;

Life's but a weary game,

And, right or wrong, the morning sun

Will find us, dead, the same."

8．The dying lips the pardon(7) breathe;

The dying hands entwine(8);

The last ray fades, and over all

The stars from heaven shine;

And the little girl with golden hair,

And one with dark eyes bright,

On Hampshire's hills, and Georgia's plain,

Were fatherless that night!



EXERCISES.—What do the first two stanzas describe? What does the third? What did one soldier say to the other? Where was his home? What friends had he there? Where was the home of the other soldier? Who waited for him? Did they forgive each other?

1．土地荒芜，地面刚刚淋湿，

晚霞火红如血，

乌云飘过，迅速消散，

一派凄凉的景象，

战马践踏过的平原，

无数战士横尸沙场，

杀戮的战场上，

躺卧着战马和骑兵。

2．有的牺牲了，有的奄奄一息，

他们再也见不到，

傍晚的月亮和深夜的繁星，

也不会感受清晨的日光。

他们不会为轻柔的呼唤叫醒，

也不会再见到家中亲人，

当战场消息传回家乡，

亲人会心痛、心碎。

3．有两个士兵倒下了，

倒在鲜红的泥土上——

白天他们是仇敌，夜间他们和平地

呼吸着生命最后的空气！

胸膛里跳动着勇敢的心；

是命运让他们成为敌人；

此刻躺在一起，一起走向死亡，

一种温暖的感情从心中生起。

4．“我们的时间不多了，”一个微弱的声音说；

“我们今天尽了全力，

为了各自一方，现在这些还有什么意义？

明天我们就将休息了！

生命已逝，我在乎的不是

我自己的生命；

可是远方的亲人啊，

今天会让他们心碎。”

5．“新罕布什尔雪山村庄里，

今晚有人会为我祷告，

一个女人，和一个小女孩

都长着金发。”

想到这些，终于忍不住，

失声痛哭起来，

这是无法抑制的——

“噢，神啊，我的妻子，我的孩子！”

6．“还有，”另一个垂死的士兵说，

“我再也看不到，

在佐治亚州平原，

我的爱人在等待着我：

一个小女孩，眼睛又黑又亮，

每天在门边等待听到；

爸爸的脚步，得到爸爸的亲吻，

她再也得不到这些了。

7．“今天我们都要了对方的生命，

死亡把一切抹平了；

很快在仁慈的神的面前

我们会一起拜倒。

趁活着我们原谅彼此吧；

生命不过是个烦恼的游戏，

不论对错，当朝阳升起，

我们都已死去，一模一样。”

8．嘴唇里互相说着原谅的话，

双手牵到一起；

晚霞渐渐消失，

天空繁星闪耀；

而一个金发的女孩，

和一个眼睛又黑又亮的少女，

在新罕布什尔山区和佐治亚平原

这个夜晚都没有了父亲！

LESSON 83

THE ATTACK ON NYMWEGEN

袭击纳梅亨


From "The History of the United Netherlands," by John Lothrop Motley, who was born in 1814, at Dorchester, Mass. He graduated at Harvard in 1831, and afterwards lived many years In Europe, writing the histories which made him famous. He died in 1877.



1．On the evening of the 10th of August, 1589, there was a wedding feast in one of the splendid mansions of the stately city. The festivities were prolonged until deep in the midsummer's night, and harp and viol were still inspiring the feet of the dancers, when on a sudden, in the midst of the holiday groups, appeared the grim visage of Martin Schenk, the man who never smiled.

2．Clad in no wedding garment, but in armor of proof, with morion(1) on head, and sword in hand, the great freebooter(2) strode heavily through the ballroom, followed by a party of those terrible musketeers(3) who never gave or asked for quarter(4), while the affrighted revelers fluttered away before them.

3．Taking advantage of a dark night, he had just dropped down the river from his castle, with five and twenty barges, had landed with his most trusted soldiers in the foremost vessels, had battered down the gate of St. Anthony, and surprised and slain the guard.

4．Without waiting for the rest of his boats, he had then stolen with his comrades through the silent streets, and torn away the latticework, and other slight defenses on the rear of the house which they had now entered, and through which they intended to possess themselves of the market place.



5．Martin had long since selected this mansion as a proper position for his enterprise, but he had not been bidden to the wedding, and was somewhat disconcerted when he found himself on the festive scene which he had so grimly interrupted.

6．Some of the merrymakers escaped from the house, and proceeded to alarm the town; while Schenk hastily fortified his position, and took possession of the square. But the burghers(5) and garrison(6) were soon on foot, and he was driven back into the house.

7．Three times he recovered the square by main strength of his own arm, seconded by the handful of men whom he had brought with him, and three times he was beaten back by overwhelming numbers into the wedding mansion.

8．The arrival of the greater part of his followers, with whose assistance he could easily have mastered the city in the first moments of surprise, was mysteriously delayed. He could not account for their prolonged absence, and was meanwhile supported only by those who had arrived with him in the foremost barges.

9．The truth—of which he was ignorant—was, that the remainder of the flotilla(7), borne along by the strong and deep current of the Waal, then in a state of freshet, had shot past the landing place, and had ever since been vainly struggling against wind and tide to force their way back to the necessary point.

10．Meantime Schenk and his followers fought desperately in the market place, and desperately in the house which he had seized. But a whole garrison, and a town full of citizens in arms proved too much for him, and he was now hotly besieged in the mansion, and at last driven forth into the streets.

11．By this time day was dawning, the whole population, soldiers and burghers, men, women, and children, were thronging about the little band of marauders(8), and assailing them with every weapon and every missile to be found. Schenk fought with his usual ferocity, but at last the musketeers, in spite of his indignant commands, began rapidly to retreat toward the quay(9).

12．In vain Martin stormed and cursed, in vain with his own hand he struck more than one of his soldiers dead. He was swept along with the panic-stricken band, and when, shouting and gnashing his teeth with frenzy, he reached the quay at last, he saw at a glance why his great enterprise had failed.

13．The few empty barges of his own party were moored at the steps; the rest were half a mile off, contending hopelessly against the swollen and rapid Waal. Schenk, desperately wounded, was left almost alone upon the wharf, for his routed followers had plunged helter-skelter into the boats, several of which, overladen in the panic, sank at once, leaving the soldiers to drown or struggle with the waves.

14．The game was lost. Nothing was left the freebooter but retreat. Reluctantly turning his back on his enemies, now in full cry close behind him, Schenk sprang into the last remaining boat just pushing from the quay. Already overladen, it foundered(10) with his additional weight, and Martin Schenk, encumbered(11) with his heavy armor, sank at once to the bottom of the Waal.

15．Some of the fugitives succeeded in swimming down the stream, and were picked up by their comrades in the barges below the town, and so made their escape. Many were drowned with their captain. A few days afterward, the inhabitants of Nymwegen fished up the body of the famous partisan(12). He was easily recognized by his armor, and by his truculent(13) face, still wearing the scowl with which he had last rebuked his followers.

选自《统一尼德兰史》，作者约翰·洛思罗普·莫特利，1814年生于马萨诸塞州多切斯特，1831年毕业于哈佛大学，在欧洲生活多年，以历史创作闻名，1877年去世。



1．1589年8月10日夜，在这个伟大城市的一座富丽堂皇的大厦里正举办一场婚宴。庆祝活动一直持续到半夜，人们伴着竖琴和小提琴翩翩起舞，突然在庆祝的人群中出现了从来不笑的马丁·申克的阴冷面孔。

2．他没穿礼服，而是穿着盔甲，手中拿着剑，这个著名的强盗步履沉重地穿过舞厅，身后跟着一队恐怖的火枪手，这些人从不要求得到或给予别人怜悯，受惊的狂欢者纷纷让路。

3．乘着漆黑的夜色，二十五条驳船从他们的城堡顺流而下。他带着最亲信的士兵，来到了圣安东尼城，撞开城门，杀死了毫无准备的把守城门的卫兵。

4．没等别的船上的人，他和他的战友悄悄穿过寂静的街道，破坏了屋后的栅栏等无足轻重的防御设施，进入了屋子，他们想据此占领市场。

5．马丁一直想选这栋大厦作为行动的根据地，可是他没有收到婚礼邀请，当他发现自己冷酷地打断了庆祝婚礼的现场时也感到有点窘迫。

6．一些寻欢作乐的人从房子里逃了出来，报了警，全城都知道了；申克急急忙忙地巩固他的根据地，并且占领了广场。可是居民和驻军很快站稳了脚跟，把他赶到房子里。

7．凭借他自己的力量，和他带领的那一小部分人，他们三次收复了市场，可是三次又都被数量众多的居民和驻军打回到举办婚礼的大厦。

8．如果他的大队人马到来，他们可以不费力气地突袭占领这个城市，可是他们竟然神秘地没有出现。他不知道他们为什么迟到，只能依靠先到的几只驳船的人进行抵抗。

9．他不了解的真相是，他的船队顺着瓦尔河湍急的水流，在涨水的时候迅速驶过了登陆地点，而后又费力地逆风逆流向登陆地点行驶。

10．同时申克和他的人在市场和房子里绝望地战斗。可是全体驻军和武装起来的居民人数实在太多了，他们被紧紧包围在大厦里，最终被赶到了街上。

11．此时黎明已经到来，所有人，包括驻军和市民，男人、女人和孩子，紧紧困住了这一小撮海盗，用各种武器和所有能找到的投掷物向他们攻击。申克和往常一样凶猛作战，可是最后火枪手们已经不听他愤怒的命令了，开始迅速朝码头方向撤退。

12．尽管马丁暴跳如雷，大声咒骂，还亲手杀死了几个随从，可是已经无济于事了。尽管他愤怒地大喊大叫，咬牙切齿，他的恐慌的随从还是裹带着他到达了码头，一眼他就明白了大队人马没赶到的原因。

13．几只空驳船系在踏板上，其余的都在一英里以外漂浮着，无望地对抗着汹涌澎湃的瓦尔河。码头上几乎只剩下重伤之下的申克一人，溃败的随从匆匆忙忙一头扎进小船，仓惶中由于分量太重，几艘船立刻沉了下去，士兵们或被淹死或在波涛里挣扎着。

14．游戏失败了，强盗们只得撤退。申克不情愿地转过身，背对身后大声叫喊的人们，跃入仅存的最后一只小船。小船已经超重，再加上他的体重，立刻沉了下去，而申克由于浑身穿着甲胄，立刻沉入了瓦尔河底。15．一些人顺流游到了下游，被停靠在下游的同伙救起，成功逃跑了。很多人和他们的首领一起葬身水中。几天后，纳梅亨的居民打捞出来这个著名的强盗的尸体。从甲胄和他阴冷的面孔上很容易辨认他，他还带着责骂手下时的满脸怒容。

LESSON 84

THE SEASONS

四　季


I. SPRING



H. G. Adams, an English writer, has compiled two volumes of poetical quotations, and is the author of several volumes of original poems. The following is from the "Story of the Seasons."

A bursting into greenness;

A waking as from sleep;

A twitter and a warble

That make the pulses leap:

A watching, as in childhood,

For the flowers that, one by one,

Open their golden petals(1)

To woo the fitful sun.

A gust, a flash, a gurgle,

A wish to shout and sing,

As, filled with hope and gladness,

We hail the vernal(2) Spring.



II. SUMMER



Now is the high tide of the year,

And whatever of life hath ebbed(3) away

Comes flooding back with a ripply cheer,

Into every bare inlet and creek and bay.

We may shut our eyes, but we can not help knowing

That skies are clear and grass is growing;

The breeze comes whispering in our ear,

That dandelions are blossoming near,

That maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing,

That the river is bluer than the sky,

That the robin is plastering his house hard by;

And if the breeze kept the good news back

For other couriers(4) we should not lack;

We could guess it all by yon heifer's lowing,—

And hark! how clear bold chanticleer,

Warmed with the new wine of the year,

Tells all in his lusty(5) crowing.



—Lowell



III. AUTUMN



Thomas Hood, author of the following selection, was born in 1798, at London, where he was editor of the "London Magazine," and died in 1845. He is best known as a humorist, but some of his poems are full of tender feeling.

The autumn is old;

The sear(6) leaves are flying;

He hath gathered up gold

And now he is dying:

Old age, begin sighing!

The year's in the wane(7);

There is nothing adorning;

The night has no eve,

And the day has no morning;

Cold winter gives warning.



IV. WINTER



Charles T. Brooks translated the following selection from the original by the German poet, Ludwig Holty. Mr. Brooks was born at Salem, Mass., in 1813. After graduation at Harvard he entered the ministry. He translated much from the German, both of poetry and prose. He died in 1883.

Now no plumed throng

Charms the wood with song;

Icebound trees are glittering;

Merry snowbirds, twittering,

Fondly strive to cheer

Scenes so cold and drear.

Winter, still I see

Many charms in thee,—

Love thy chilly greeting,

Snowstorms fiercely beating,

And the dear delights

Of the long, long nights.

1．春

作者H·G·亚当斯，英国作家，编辑过两卷诗集，也创作过几卷诗歌。以下诗歌选自《季节的故事》。



一片生机勃勃的绿，

就像刚刚从睡梦中苏醒，

鸟儿发出啁啾的鸣叫，

让我的脉搏跳动。



仍然像孩童时候一样，

看着鲜花一朵朵，

绽放着金色的花瓣，

好像在追求日光。



微风袭人，泉水淙淙。

我们多么想大声呼唤和歌唱，

我们呼唤春天来了，

心中充满了希望和喜悦。



2．夏



夏天是一年的高峰，

不论生命曾经消逝，

都已奔回，像荡漾的水波，

充满了干涸的河流和小溪。

即使闭上双眼，我也知道，

天空清澈，小草茂盛，

微风似在耳语，

蒲公英也在绽放，

玉米长出新芽，小河欢快流淌，

河水比天还蓝，

知更鸟也在忙着筑巢，

如果微风不把好消息送来，

我们能猜出来，

我们也不乏其他信使，

牛犊哞哞叫着，

雄鸡像饮了新酒，

啼叫声多么嘹亮。



3．秋



以下部分作者托马斯·胡德，1798年生于伦敦，曾任《伦敦杂志》编辑，1845年去世，是广为人知的幽默作家，他的一些诗歌感情细腻。

晚秋已经到来，

叶子也枯萎了，到处飞扬，

曾经是绚丽的金秋，

现在却走向死亡，

像老年人一样唏嘘着！



一年已快到头了，

大自然也不再点缀，

夜晚时黄昏很短，

白天也没有清晨，

冬天已经在逼近了。



4．冬



以下选自布鲁克斯翻译的德国诗人霍尔蒂的诗歌。布鲁克斯于1813年生于马萨诸塞州的萨勒姆镇，哈佛毕业后成为牧师。他由德语翻译了很多诗歌和散文，1883年去世。



不再有人群佩戴羽饰，

在树林中欢快地歌唱，

树已结冰，闪着微光；

快乐的雪鸟欢快歌唱，

天真地要把士气鼓舞，

到处依然严寒和荒凉。

我却能从冬天里看到，

冬天无穷无尽的魅力，

当清晨寒气扑面而来，

当暴雪猛烈敲打窗户，

即使长长的冬日夜晚，

也有一种亲切的喜悦。

LESSON 85

BRANDYWINE FORD

白兰地酒河浅滩


Bayard Taylor was born at Kennett Square, Penn., in 1825. He received a limited school education, but at an early age displayed great energy and talent. He was a great traveler, and a fluent, graceful writer, both of prose and verse. Mr. Taylor held high official positions under the government. The following selection is adapted from "The Story of Kennett," He died in 1878.



1．The black, dreary night, seemed interminable(1). He could only guess, here and there, at a landmark, and was forced to rely more upon Roger's instinct of the road than upon the guidance of his senses. Toward midnight, as he judged, by the solitary crow of a cock, the rain almost entirely ceased.

2．The wind began to blow sharp and keen, and the hard vault of the sky to lift a little. He fancied that the hills on his right had fallen away, and that the horizon was suddenly depressed(2) towards the north. Roger's feet began to splash in constantly deepening water, and presently a roar, distinct from that of the wind, filled the air.

3．It was the Brandywine. The stream had overflowed its broad meadow bottoms, and was running high and fierce beyond its main channel. The turbid(3) waters made a dim, dusky gleam around him; soon the fences disappeared, and the flood reached to his horse's body.

4．But he knew that the ford could be distinguished by the break in the fringe of timber; moreover, that the creek bank was a little higher than the meadows behind it, and so far, at least, he might venture. The ford was not more than twenty yards across, and he could trust Roger to swim that distance.

5．The faithful animal pressed bravely on, but Gilbert soon noticed that he seemed at fault. The swift water had forced him out of the road, and he stopped from time to time, as if anxious and uneasy. The timber could now be discerned(4), only a short distance in advance, and in a few minutes they would gain the bank.

6．What was that? A strange, rustling, hissing sound, as of cattle trampling through dry reeds,—a sound which quivered and shook, even in the breath of the hurrying wind! Roger snorted, stood still, and trembled in every limb; and a sensation of awe and terror struck a chill through Gilbert's heart. The sound drew swiftly nearer, and became a wild, seething(5) roar, filling the whole breadth of the valley.

7．"The dam! the dam!" cried Gilbert, "the dam has given way!" He turned Roger's head, gave him the rein, struck, spurred, cheered, and shouted. The brave beast struggled through the impeding(6) flood, but the advance wave of the coming inundation(7) already touched his side. He staggered; a line of churning foam bore down upon them, the terrible roar was all around and over them, and horse and rider were whirled away.

8．What happened during the first few seconds, Gilbert could never distinctly recall. Now they were whelmed in the water, now riding its careering tide, torn through the tops of brushwood, jostled by floating logs and timbers of the dam, but always, as it seemed, remorselessly held in the heart of the tumult and the ruin.

9．He saw at last that they had fallen behind the furious onset(8) of the flood, but Roger was still swimming with it, desperately throwing up his head from time to time, and snorting the water from his nostrils. All his efforts to gain a foothold failed; his strength was nearly spent, and unless some help should come in a few minutes it would come in vain. And in the darkness, and the rapidity with which they were borne along, how should help come?

10．All at once Roger's course stopped. He became an obstacle to the flood, which pressed him against some other obstacle below, and rushed over horse and rider. Thrusting out his hand, Gilbert felt the rough bark of a tree. Leaning towards it, and clasping the log in his arms, he drew himself from the saddle, while Roger, freed from his burden, struggled into the current and instantly disappeared.

11．As nearly as Gilbert could ascertain, several timbers, thrown over each other, had lodged, probably upon a rocky islet in the stream, the uppermost one projecting slantingly out of the flood. It required all his strength to resist the current which sucked, and whirled, and tugged at his body, and to climb high enough to escape its force, without overbalancing his support. At last, though still half immerged(9), he found himself comparatively safe for a time, yet as far as ever from a final rescue.

12．Yet a new danger now assailed him, from the increasing cold. There was already a sting of frost, a breath of ice, in the wind. In another hour the sky was nearly swept bare of clouds, and he could note the lapse(10) of the night by the sinking of the moon. But he was by this time hardly in a condition to note anything more.

贝亚德·泰勒，1825年生于宾夕法尼亚州的肯尼特斯奎尔。他接受了有限的学校教育，但在早年就展现了惊人的能量和天赋。他是伟大的旅行家，文字流畅优美，散文和诗歌都很擅长。泰勒在政府中担任重要职务。以下改写自《肯尼特的故事》。他于1878年去世。



1．漆黑单调的夜似乎没有止境。所经过的地方，他只能通过路标作出推测，甚至更多地依靠罗杰的本能来认路。临近半夜，他听到了一声鸡鸣，心想雨快停了。

2．寒风刺骨，天空开阔了一点。他感到右侧的山峦变远了，地平线也向北方移动。罗杰的蹄子在深水里溅起水花，突然，和四周的风声完全不同的咆哮声传来。

3．这里是白兰地酒河。河水已经漫过宽广的低洼地带，漫过了主河道。四周浑浊的水闪烁着暗淡的光；围栏很快就看不见了，水涨到了马的身体。

4．但他知道还是可以通过围栏的缝隙分辨出浅滩来。此外，河岸比低洼处高，他可以涉险过去。浅滩只有二十码宽，罗杰一定能游过去。

5．忠实的罗杰奋力地向前游，可是吉尔伯特很快注意到他似乎犯了错误。迅速上涨的河水迫使他离开了公路，必须不时停下来，显得急迫和不安。可以看到，围栏就在前方不远，几分钟后就能到河岸了。

6．那是什么？一种奇怪的嘶嘶的声音传来，就像牛群踩过芦苇丛的声音，即使是在风里，这声音也令人震颤！罗杰打了个响鼻，一动不动，四肢发抖；一丝敬畏使吉尔伯特心寒。声音迅速靠近，变成了翻腾的咆哮声，响彻山谷。

7．“大坝！大坝！”吉尔伯特叫了起来，“大坝决口了！”他转向罗杰的头，抓住缰绳用力拍打、喊叫、给马加油。勇敢的罗杰在洪水中奋力挣扎，可是洪水已经涨到了马的身体。马踉跄了一下；洪水夹杂着漩涡和泡沫袭来，四周都是洪水的咆哮声，马和骑手被卷走了。

8．吉尔伯特无法清楚记得最初几秒发生了什么。他们一会被洪水淹没，一会又被冲到奔腾的浪尖，有时水底的灌木撕扯着身体，有时被水中漂浮的木材撞得东倒西歪，就这样困在了无情的洪水和杂物中间。

9．虽然洪峰把他们落在后面，罗杰仍然绝望地游着，不时探头从鼻孔喷出水。他想找到落脚地，可是他的努力都失败了；他几乎用尽了力气，除非几分钟后有人来救援，否则一切都是徒劳。可是天又黑洪水又急，怎么会有人救援呢？

10．吉尔伯特突然感到身体下方有一股力量在吸引他的身体，因此停了下来。他费力向外伸出手，摸到了粗糙的树干。他向树靠近，双臂抱住树干，离开了马鞍，同时罗杰由于减少了分量，被奔腾的洪流冲走，立刻消失了。

11．正如吉尔伯特想到的，几根木材摞在一起，堆在水中一处小岛上，最上面那根倾斜着伸出水面。他使出全身力气对抗着吸引他的旋涡，向更高处爬才躲开，又避免抱住的大树失去平衡。最后，尽管半个身体还在水里，但他发现自己相对安全了，可是离最后获救仍然很遥远。

12．这时新的危险袭来，水越来越冷。风也带着寒霜和冰的气息。一个小时后，天空中乌云被吹散了，从正在落山的月亮知道夜晚即将过去。可是他这时已经没法注意更多东西了。

LESSON 86

BRANDYWINE FORD (CNCLUDED)

白兰地酒河浅滩（结束篇）


1．The moon was low in the west, and there was a pale glimmer of the coming dawn in the sky, when Gilbert Potter suddenly raised his head. Above the noise of the water and the whistle of the wind, he heard a familiar sound,—the shrill, sharp neigh of a horse. Lifting himself with great exertion, to a sitting posture, he saw two men, on horseback, in the flooded meadow, a little below him. They stopped, seemed to consult, and presently drew nearer.

2．Gilbert tried to shout, but the muscles of his throat were stiff, and his lungs refused to act. The horse neighed again. This time there was no mistake; it was Roger that he heard! Voice came to him, and he cried aloud,—a hoarse, strange, unnatural cry.

The horsemen heard it, and rapidly pushed up the bank, until they reached a point directly opposite to him. The prospect(1) of escape brought a thrill of life to his frame; he looked around and saw that the flood had indeed fallen.

3．"We have no rope," he heard one of the men say. "How shall we reach him?”

"There is no time to get one now," the other answered. "My horse is stronger than yours. I'll go into the creek just below, where it's broader and not so deep, and work my way up to him."

"But one horse can't carry both."

"His will follow, be sure, when it sees me."

4．As the last speaker moved away, Gilbert saw a led horse plunging through the water beside the other. It was a difficult and dangerous undertaking. The horseman and the loose horse entered the main stream below, where its divided channel met and broadened, but it was still above the saddle girths, and very swift.

5．Sometimes the animals plunged, losing their foothold; nevertheless, they gallantly breasted(2) the current, and inch by inch worked their way to a point about six feet below Gilbert. It seemed impossible to approach nearer.

"Can you swim?" asked the man.

Gilbert shook his head. "Throw me the end of Roger's bridle!" he then cried.

6．The man unbuckled the bridle and threw it, keeping the end of the rein in his hand. Gilbert tried to grasp it, but his hands were too numb(3). He managed, however, to get one arm and his head through the opening, and relaxed(4) his hold on the log.

7．A plunge, and the man had him by the collar. He felt himself lifted by a strong arm and laid across Roger's saddle. With his failing strength and stiff limbs, it was no slight task to get into place; and the return, though less laborious to the horses, was equally dangerous, because Gilbert was scarcely able to support himself without help.

"You're safe now," said the man, when they reached the bank, "but it's a downright mercy of God that you're alive!"

8．The other horseman joined them, and they rode slowly across the flooded meadow. They had both thrown their cloaks around Gilbert, and carefully steadied him in the saddle, one on each side. He was too much exhausted to ask how they had found him, or whither they were taking him,—too numb for curiosity, almost for gratitude.

9．"Here's your savior!" said one of the men, patting Roger's shoulder. "It was through him that we found you. Do you wish to know how? Well—about three o'clock it was, maybe a little earlier, maybe a little later, my wife woke me up. 'Do you hear that?' she said.

10．"I listened and heard a horse in the lane before the door, neighing,—I can't tell you exactly how it was,—as though he would call up the house. It was rather queer, I thought, so I got up and looked out of the window, and it seemed to me he had a saddle on. He stamped, and pawed, and then he gave another neigh, and stamped again.

11．"Said I to my wife, 'There is something wrong here,' and I dressed and went out. When he saw me, he acted in the strangest way you ever saw; thought I, if ever an animal wanted to speak, that animal does. When I tried to catch him, he shot off, ran down the lane a bit, and then came back acting as strangely as ever.

12．"I went into the house and woke up my brother, here, and we saddled our horses and started. Away went yours ahead, stopping every minute to look around and see if we followed. When we came to the water I rather hesitated, but it was of no use; the horse would have us go on and on, till we found you. I never heard of such a thing before, in all my life." Gilbert did not speak, but two large tears slowly gathered in his eyes, and rolled down his cheeks. The men saw his emotion(5), and respected it.

13．In the light of the cold, keen dawn, they reached a snug farmhouse, a mile from the Brandywine. The men lifted Gilbert from the saddle, and would have carried him immediately into the house, but he first leaned upon Roger's neck, took the faithful creature's head in his arms, and kissed it.

1．月已西斜，空中闪烁着清晨的微光，吉尔伯特·波特突然抬起头。在风的呼啸和水声中，他听到了一个熟悉的声音——马的嘶鸣。费力地撑身坐起，他看到在已被洪水淹没的低洼地里有两个人骑在马上。他们停了下来，商量着什么，很快向他靠拢。

2．吉尔伯特想要喊叫，可是喉部肌肉僵硬，发不出声。马又发出了一声嘶鸣。没错，是罗杰！他终于可以发出声音了，他大声喊叫——声音嘶哑、奇怪，极其不自然。

骑马的人听到声音，迅速上了河岸，来到和他正相对的一个地方。获救的前景使他兴奋起来；看看四周，洪水确实已经退了。

3．“我们没有绳子，”他听到其中一个人说，“我们怎么才能够到他呢？”

“没有时间取绳子了，”另一个人回答，“我的马比你的健壮。我去稍微靠下的河里，那里宽一些，水也不太深，我争取靠近他。”

“可是一匹马驮不了两个人。”

“他的马会跟来，我敢肯定，它看到我时就会跟来的。”

4．后一个说话的人走过去，吉尔伯特看到一匹灰马趟着水，走在另一匹马旁边。非常艰难而且危险。骑手和马进入了下方河流的主干，这里两股水渠相交，河流变宽，可是水仍高过马的腹带，而且水流很急。

5．有时马踩空，失去平衡；尽管如此，他们仍勇敢地面对洪水，一寸寸地来到了距离吉尔伯特六英尺的地方。不可能更靠近了。

“你还能游吗？”那个人说。

吉尔伯特摇了摇头。“扔给我罗杰的缰绳！”他大喊道。

6．那个人解开马的缰绳，扔了过来。吉尔伯特试图抓住另一端，可他的手麻木了。最后他终于让一只胳膊和头穿过缰绳的圆孔，放开了一直抱着的树干。

7．向前一跨步，那个人抓住了他的衣领。他感到一只强有力的手把他提了起来，放到了罗杰的鞍子上。由于他力气丧失，手脚麻木，坐稳可不容易；回程不那么费力，也同样危险，因为如果没人帮忙，吉尔伯特无法坐稳。

“你现在安全了，”到河岸时那个人说，“全是上帝的怜悯，你还活着！”

8．另一个骑手走过来，他们缓慢骑过低洼地。他们都把外衣给吉尔伯特披上，一边一个，小心地扶着他。他太疲劳了，无法询问他们是如何找到他的，要到哪儿去——身体都冻麻木了，顾不上好奇和表达感激之情。

9．“这是你的救命恩人！”一个骑手拍着罗杰的肩说，“我们是通过他找到你的。想知道怎么回事吗？好的——大约三点钟的时候，或许更早或更晚一点，我的妻子叫醒我，说，‘听到了吗？’

10．“我听到门前马嘶鸣的声音，——我无法准确地告诉你是什么样的声音，他好像要叫醒我们全家。非常奇怪，我想，因此我起床，朝窗外看去，马上似乎有马鞍。他跺着蹄子，抓着地，又叫了一声，然后又跺着蹄子。

11．“我对我的妻子说，‘一定出了什么事，’便穿好衣服，出去了。当他看见我时，他的动作很奇怪。我想，如果动物想说话，这匹马一定是想要说话。当我要抓他的时候，他飞跑起来，然后返回来，动作和原来一样奇怪。

12．“我进屋叫醒我的兄弟，我们给马备了鞍，出发了，你的马走在前面，每隔一会回头看看我们是不是跟着。来到水边时，我犹豫了，可是没用；这马就是让我们不断往前走，直到发现了你。我以前从没听到过这种事儿。”吉尔伯特没说话，可是双眼含泪，泪水顺着脸颊流了下来。两个人看到他动了感情，都很敬重他。

13．在清晨寒冷的阳光中，他们来到了一个温暖舒适的农宅，离白兰地酒河一英里远。两个人把吉尔伯特从马鞍上抱起来，要立刻把他送进屋子里，可是他先是靠在了罗杰的脖子上，双臂抱住马的头，亲了一下。

LESSON 87

THE BEST CAPITAL

最好的资本


Louisa May Alcott was born at Germantown, Pa., in 1833, and, among other works, wrote many beautiful stories for children. During the Civil War she was a hospital nurse at Washington. The following selection is adapted from "Little Men." She died in 1888.



1．One would have said that modest John Brooke, in his busy, quiet, humble life, had had little time to make friends; but now they seemed to start up everywhere,—old and young, rich and poor, high and low; for all unconsciously his influence had made itself widely felt, his virtues were remembered, and his hidden charities rose up to bless him.

2．The group about his coffin was a far more eloquent eulogy(1) than any that man could utter. There were the rich men whom he had served faithfully for years; the poor old women whom he cherished(2) with his little store, in memory of his mother; the wife to whom he had given such happiness that death could not mar it utterly; the brothers and sisters in whose hearts he had made a place forever; the little son and daughter who already felt the loss of his strong arm and tender voice; the young children, sobbing for their kindest playmate, and the tall lads, watching with softened faces a scene which they never could forget.

3．That evening, as the Plumfield boys sat on the steps, as usual, in the mild September moonlight, they naturally fell to talking of the event of the day.

Emil began by breaking out in his impetuous way, "Uncle Fritz is the wisest, and Uncle Laurie the jolliest, but Uncle John was the best; and I'd rather be like him than any man I ever saw."

4．"So would I. Did you hear what those gentlemen said to Grandpa to-day? I would like to have that said of me when I was dead;" and Franz felt with regret that he had not appreciated(3) Uncle John enough.

"What did they say?" asked Jack, who had been much impressed by the scenes of the day.

5．"Why, one of the partners of Mr. Laurence, where Uncle John has been ever so long, was saying that he was conscientious(4) almost to a fault as a business man, and above reproach in all things. Another gentleman said no money could repay the fidelity and honesty with which Uncle John had served him, and then Grandpa told them the best of all.

6．"Uncle John once had a place in the office of a man who cheated, and when this man wanted uncle to help him do it, uncle wouldn't, though he was offered a big salary. The man was angry, and said, 'You will never get on in business with such strict principles;' and uncle answered back, 'I never will try to get on without them,' and left the place for a much harder and poorer one."

7．"Good!" cried several of the boys warmly, for they were in the mood(5)to understand and value the little story as never before.

"He wasn't rich, was he?" asked Jack.

"No."

"He never did anything to make a stir in the world, did he?"

"No."

"He was only good?"

"That's all;" and Franz found himself wishing that Uncle John had done something to boast of, for it was evident that Jack was disappointed by his replies.

8．"Only good. That is all and everything," said Uncle Fritz, who had overheard the last few words, and guessed what was going on in the minds of the lads.

"Let me tell you a little about John Brooke, and you will see why men honor him, and why he was satisfied to be good rather than rich or famous. He simply did his duty in all things, and did it so cheerfully, so faithfully, that it kept him patient, brave, and happy, through poverty and loneliness and years of hard work.

9．"He was a good son, and gave up his own plans to stay and live with his mother while she needed him. He was a good friend, and taught your Uncle Laurie much beside his Greek and Latin, did it unconsciously, perhaps, by showing him an example of an upright man.

10．"He was a faithful servant, and made himself so valuable to those who employed him that they will find it hard to fill his place. He was a good husband and father, so tender, wise, and thoughtful, that Laurie and I learned much of him, and only knew how well he loved his family when we discovered all he had done for them, unsuspected and unassisted."

11．Uncle Fritz stopped a minute, and the boys sat like statues in the moonlight until he went on again, in a subdued(6) and earnest voice: "As he lay dying, I said to him, 'Have no care for your wife and the little ones; I will see that they never want.' Then he smiled and pressed my hand, and answered, in his cheerful way, 'No need of that; I have cared for them.'

12．"And so he had, for when we looked among his papers, all was in order,—not a debt remained; and safely put away was enough to keep his wife comfortable and independent(7). Then we knew why he had lived so plainly, denied himself so many pleasures, except that of charity, and worked so hard that I fear he shortened his good life.

13．"He never asked help for himself, though often for others, but bore his own burden and worked out his own task bravely and quietly. No one can say a word of complaint against him, so just and generous and kind was he; and now, when he is gone, all find so much to love and praise and honor, that I am proud to have been his friend, and would rather leave my children the legacy(8) he leaves his than the largest fortune ever made.

14．"Yes! simple, genuine goodness is the best capital(9) to found the business of this life upon. It lasts when fame and money fail, and is the only riches we can take out of this world with us. Remember that, my boys; and, if you want to earn respect and confidence and love, follow in the footsteps of John Brooke."

路易莎·梅·奥尔科特，1833年生于宾夕法尼亚州杰曼镇，除了其他作品，还写过一些优美的儿童故事。内战时期，她在华盛顿担任护士。以下改写自《小男子汉》。她于1888年去世。



1．有人可能会说诚实的约翰·布鲁克，忙碌、安静、卑微的一生中很少有时间交朋友；可是现在他的朋友似乎无处不在，——老人和孩子，富人和穷人，高个儿和矮个儿；所有人不知不觉都感受到了他的影响，人们记起了他的美德，他默默的善行也带给他祝福。

2．棺木旁的人群比颂词更流畅。有他忠实服务过的富人；有他用自己的小店照顾过的贫困老妇人，他这么做是为了怀念他的母亲；有他的妻子，他带给她的幸福死亡也带不走；有他的兄弟姐妹，他们在心里永远怀念他；有他的儿女，他们感到失去了强有力的臂膀和亲切的声音；小孩子们因为失去了一个玩伴而啜泣，大一点的孩子们神色温和地看着这永远难忘的情景。

3．当晚，梅园的男孩子们像往常一样坐在台阶上，九月的月光照射下来，他们自然谈起这天发生的事情。

急切的埃米尔抢先说话：“弗里茨舅舅最有智慧，劳里舅舅最快活，可是约翰舅舅最好；我宁愿做像他一样的人。”

4．“我也是。你们听到今天那些绅士们对祖母说的话了吗？我真希望我死的时候别人也这么说我。”弗兰斯遗憾地觉得自己以前对约翰舅舅敬仰得不够。

“他们说什么了？”杰克问，今天的情景给杰克留下了深刻的印象。

5．“嗯，劳伦斯先生的一个合伙人和约翰舅舅共事过很长时间，他说他作为商人的责任心几乎到了挑剔的程度，他做的所有事情都无可指责。另一个商人说任何金钱都无法酬报约翰舅舅服务的忠诚和诚实，然后祖母讲了约翰舅舅做的一件了不起的事。”

6．“约翰舅舅曾经在某个人的公司做事，那个人做了骗人的事，当他让舅舅帮助他骗人的时候，舅舅拒绝了，尽管他许诺给他很高的薪水。那个人很难生气，说，‘你这么有原则性，在生意上不会取得成功的；’舅舅回答他说，‘我永远不会通过骗人取得成功。’后来舅舅离开了那儿，从事了一份更艰苦收入更少的工作。”

7．“太棒了！”几个男孩热情地叫了起来，因为他们了解这个小故事的价值。

“他不是富人，是吗？”杰克问。

“不是。”

“他从来没有做过什么惊天动地的事，是吗？”

“没做过。”

“他只是一个好人？”

“完全如此！”弗兰斯此时知道自己希望约翰舅舅做过什么值得吹嘘的事，杰克对他的回答显然有些失望。

8．“只是个好人，这是最重要的。”弗里茨舅舅说。他无意中听到了最后几句话，猜到了孩子们心里想着什么。“让我告诉你们一点约翰·布鲁克的事，你们就会看到为什么人们尊敬他，为什么他宁愿做个好人，而不是富人、名人。他只是热情地、诚心诚意地尽自己的一切义务，这使他尽管贫困、孤独、多年辛劳却仍然充满耐心、勇气和幸福。

9．“他是个好儿子，放弃了自己的计划，为了和需要自己的母亲在一起生活。他是个好朋友，除了教劳里舅舅希腊文和拉丁文，还不知不觉地教给他很多东西，或者是通过自身的榜样告诉他怎样做一个正直的人。

10．“他是个忠实的仆人，为雇主创造价值，他们感到他是不可代替的。他是个好丈夫和好父亲，亲切、有智慧、体贴周到，劳里和我从他身上学到了很多东西，当我们发现他独自默默地为家人所做的一切后，我们知道了他是多么爱他的家人。”

11．弗里茨舅舅停了一会，月光下，孩子们像雕像一样坐着，他继续说道，声音低沉而认真：“当他临死前躺在床上，我对他说，‘不要担心你的妻子和孩子；我会照顾他们，让他们什么也不少。’他笑了，按住我的手，用他一贯热情的方式答道，‘不用了，我已经替他们安排好了。’”

12．“他确实安排好了，当我们查看他的遗嘱的时候，一切井井有条——没有债务，他的积蓄足够让他的妻子过上舒适而独立的生活。我们这才知道他为什么过那么简朴的生活，一点快乐都不享受，除非是为了慈善，而且那么努力工作，我感觉他缩短了自己的寿命。

13．“他从来不为自己求人，却常常为了他人向人求助，他承担自己的担子，勇敢、安静地完成自己的工作。没人对他有一句怨言，他是那么公正、慷慨和善良；现在，他走了，人们发现他是那么值得爱、赞扬和尊敬，我很骄傲曾经是他的朋友，我宁愿把他留给他的孩子的遗产留给我的孩子，而不是很多金钱。

14．“是的！简单、真诚的善良就是奠定这一生的最好资本。当名誉和金钱消失的时候，它依然存在，它是我们能从这个世界带走的唯一财富。记住，孩子们；如果你想要赢得尊敬、信心和爱，就要踩着布鲁克舅舅的脚印走。”

LESSON 88

THE INCHCAPE ROCK(1)

印奇开普暗礁


Robert Southey was a celebrated English poet, born in 1774, who once held the honorable position of poet laureate. He wrote a great deal both in prose and verse. He died in 1843.

1．No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,

The ship was as still as she could be,

Her sails from heaven received no motion,

Her keel(2) was steady in the ocean.

2．Without either sign or sound of their shock

The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock(3);

So little they rose, so little they fell,

They did not move the Inchcape Bell.

3．The good old Abbot of Aberbrothok

Had placed that bell on the lnchcape Rock;

On a buoy(4) in the storm it floated and swung,

And over the waves its warning rung.

4．When the Rock was hid by the surges'(5) swell,

The mariners heard the warning bell;

And then they knew the perilous Rock,

And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok.

5．The sun in heaven was shining gay,

All things were joyful on that day;

The sea birds screamed as they wheeled round,

And there was joyance(6) in their sound.

6．The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen

A darker speck on the ocean green;

Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,

And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.

7．He felt the cheering power of spring,

It made him whistle, it made him sing;

His heart was mirthful to excess,

But the Rover's mirth was wickedness.

8．His eye was on the Inchcape float;

Quoth he, "My men put out the boat,



And row me to the Inchcape Rock,

And I'll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok."

9．The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,

And to the Inchcape Rock they go;

Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,

And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.

10．Down sunk the bell, with a gurgling sound,

The bubbles rose and burst around;

Quoth Sir Ralph, "The next who comes to the Rock,

Won't bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok."

11．Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away,

He scoured(7) the seas for many a day;

And now grown rich with plundered store(8),

He steers his course for Scotland's shore.

12．So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky

They can not see the sun on high;

The wind hath blown a gale all day,

At evening it hath died away.

13．On the deck the Rover takes his stand,

So dark it is they see no land.

Quoth Sir Ralph, "It will be lighter soon,

For there is the dawn of the rising moon."

14．"Canst hear," said one, "the breakers roar?

For methinks(9) we should be near the shore."

"Now where we are I can not tell,

But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell."

15．They hear no sound, the swell is strong;

Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,

Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock:

Cried they, "It is the Inchcape Rock!”

16．Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,

He curst himself in his despair;

The waves rush in on every side,

The ship is sinking beneath the tide.

17．But even in his dying fear

One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,

A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell

The fiends(10) below were ringing his knell(11).

罗伯特·骚塞，英国著名诗人，生于1774年，有桂冠诗人的荣誉，他写过大量的散文和诗歌，于1843年去世。

1．空中无风，海面平静，

帆一动不动，

船也一动不动，

稳稳停在海里。

2．波涛无声无息地流淌，

流淌过印奇开普暗礁，

波浪缓缓起伏，

印奇开普钟不摇不晃。

3．善良的老艾伯布洛索克修道院长

把钟挂在印奇开普暗礁一个浮标上，

暴风雨来时就会摇晃，

发出声响。

4．当波涛涌起遮蔽了暗礁，

船员们仍会听到钟的响声；

他们知道致命的暗礁的位置，

全都祝福艾伯布洛索克修道院长。

5．空中照耀着明亮的太阳，

这天一切都那么令人喜悦，

海鸟盘旋发出尖叫，

声音中也充满欢畅。

6．在泛绿的大海上，

印奇开普暗礁的浮标只是个黑点；

海盗拉尔夫在甲板上踱步，

目光盯在了那个黑点上。

7．他感到春天使人振奋的力量，

这令他吹响口哨唱起歌；

他的心充满快乐，

可是海盗的快乐是邪恶。

8．注视着印奇开普浮标，

他说，“我的人放下小船，

送我到印奇开普暗礁，

我要让艾伯布洛索克修道院长烦恼。”

9．小船放下，船员摇桨，

他们到了印奇开普暗礁；

海盗拉尔夫从船上弯腰，

从印奇开普浮标把钟砍掉。

10．钟沉入大海，汩汩做响

泡沫升起又破裂，

海盗拉尔夫说，“下一个人到暗礁，

不会再祝福艾伯布洛索克修道院长了。”

11．海盗拉尔夫的船驶离暗礁，

在海上飘荡了很多天；

抢劫的财物使他变富了，

他把船驶向苏格兰海岸。

12．浓雾布满了大海，

不能看到空中的太阳；

大风刮了一整天，

夜晚平息了。

13．海盗站在甲板上，

一片漆黑看不见陆地。

海盗拉尔夫说，“很快会亮些，

月亮开始出现了。”

14．一个船员说，“听到波浪拍打礁石声了吗？

我想我们离海岸不远了。”

“我也不知道我们在哪儿，

可我希望听到印奇开普的钟声。”

15．他们什么也听不到，波浪汹涌，

尽管风已平息，他们的船依旧漂浮着，

最后船撞上暗礁猛地震动，

他们喊：“这里是印奇开普暗礁！”

16．海盗拉尔夫揪着自己的头发，

绝望地诅咒自己；

波浪从四面涌入船里，

船已经沉到浪底。

17．在垂死的惊恐中，

海盗依然听到一个可怖的声音，

好像是印奇开普钟声，

下面的魔鬼在为他敲响。

LESSON 89

MY MOTHER'S GRAVE

母亲的坟墓


1．It was thirteen years since my mother's death, when, after a long absence from my native village, I stood beside the sacred mound beneath which I had seen her buried. Since that mournful(1) period, a great change had come over me. My childish years had passed away, and with them my youthful character. The world was altered, too; and as I stood at my mother's grave, I could hardly realize(2) that I was the same thoughtless, happy creature, whose cheeks she so often kissed in an excess(3) of tenderness.

2．But the varied(4) events of thirteen years had not effaced(5) the remembrance of that mother's smile. It seemed as if I had seen her but yesterday—as if the blessed sound of her well-remembered voice was in my ear. The gay dreams of my infancy and childhood were brought back so distinctly to my mind that, had it not been for one bitter recollection, the tears I shed would have been gentle and refreshing.

3．The circumstance may seem a trifling one, but the thought of it now pains my heart; and I relate it, that those children who have parents to love them may learn to value them as they ought. My mother had been ill a long time, and I had become so accustomed to her pale face and weak voice, that I was not frightened at them, as children usually are. At first, it is true, I sobbed violently; but when, day after day, I returned from school, and found her the same, I began to believe she would always be spared to me; but they told me she would die.

4．One day when I had lost my place in the class, I came home discouraged and fretful. I went to my mother's chamber. She was paler than usual, but she met me with the same affectionate smile that always welcomed my return. Alas! when I look back through the lapse of thirteen years, I think my heart must have been stone not to have been melted by it. She requested me to go downstairs and bring her a glass of water. I pettishly(6) asked her why she did not call a domestic to do it. With a look of mild reproach, which I shall never forget if I live to be a hundred years old, she said, "Will not my daughter bring a glass of water for her poor, sick mother?"

5．I went and brought her the water, but I did not do it kindly. Instead of smiling, and kissing her as I had been wont to do, I set the glass down very quickly, and left the room. After playing a short time, I went to bed without bidding my mother good night; but when alone in my room, in darkness and silence, I remembered how pale she looked, and how her voice trembled when she said, "Will not my daughter bring a glass of water for her poor, sick mother?" I could not sleep. I stole into her chamber to ask forgiveness. She had sunk into an easy slumber, and they told me I must not waken her.

6．I did not tell anyone what troubled me, but stole back to my bed, resolved(7) to rise early in the morning and tell her how sorry I was for my conduct. The sun was shining brightly when I awoke, and, hurrying on my clothes, I hastened to my mother's chamber. She was dead! She never spoke more—never smiled upon me again; and when I touched the hand that used to rest upon my head in blessing, it was so cold that it made me start.

7．I bowed down by her side, and sobbed in the bitterness of my heart. I then wished that I might die, and be buried with her; and, old as I now am, I would give worlds, were they mine to give, could my mother but have lived to tell me she forgave my childish ingratitude(8). But I can not call her back; and when I stand by her grave, and whenever I think of her manifold (9)kindness, the memory of that reproachful look she gave me will bite like a serpent and sting like an adder.

1．母亲已经去世十三年了，离开家乡十三年后，我站在了这片神圣的土堆旁，我曾亲眼看见她被埋葬在这里。从那悲伤的时刻以后，我的生活也已经发生了很大的变化。我的孩提岁月已成往事，青年时光也一去不返。世界也发生了变化；当我站在母亲的坟墓前，难以想象我曾经是那个双颊被母亲无数遍亲吻的天真无邪、快快乐乐的小孩子。

2．十三年的岁月也无法抹去记忆中妈妈的笑容。一切就好像是在昨天——我的耳畔依然响着她亲切的声音。儿时和童年的梦境清晰地出现在脑海，要不是一件痛苦的回忆，我流出的泪水一定是柔情似水和心旷神怡的。

3．尽管发生的只是一件小事，却依然刺痛着我的心；我描述它，就是希望那些依然享受着父母之爱的孩子们能珍惜这一切。我的母亲长期生病，我也习惯了她苍白的脸色和微弱的声音，不再像孩子一般害怕。开始的时候，我哭泣不止，可是日渐一日，当从学校返回，见到她和从前一样，我开始相信她会永远和我在一起，可是别人告诉我她快死了。

4．一天，因为考试不理想，我沮丧和烦躁地回到家里。我走进母亲的房间。她比以前更显苍白，可是她一如往常带着亲切的微笑欢迎我回来。唉！十三年后回忆起来，我想当时我的心可能是石头做的才没被融化。她叫我下楼取一杯水。我怒气冲冲地说怎么不叫佣人去。她略带责备地说，这种责备即使活一百岁我也不会忘记，“我的女儿不愿意给她生病的可怜母亲取杯水吗？”

5．我心不甘情不愿地取来了水。我没有对她笑，也没有像往常一样亲吻她，我放下杯子就离开了房间。在玩了一阵后，我上床了，没有和母亲说晚安；可是当我独自一人在安静漆黑的房间里，我想起她脸色多么苍白，她说“我的女儿不愿意给她生病的可怜母亲取杯水吗？”她的声音是多么颤抖，我无法入睡。我偷偷走进她的房间请求她原谅我。可她已经睡着了，人们告诉我不能惊醒她。

6．我没有告诉别人困扰我的是什么，悄悄地回到我的床上，我下定决心第二天早晨告诉她我是多么后悔。醒来时，太阳很刺眼，我急急忙忙换好衣服来到母亲的房间。她已经去世了！不再对我说什么，也不再对我微笑了；我触摸着她的手，她曾经把手放在我头上祝福我，现在是那么凉，使我吃了一惊。

7．我跪在她的床边，心中凄苦地啜泣。我多么希望我死了，和她埋在一起；现在不再年轻的我，如果能让母亲活着告诉我她已经原谅我儿时不懂得感恩，我愿意用全世界来交换——如果全世界都是我的。但是时间不会倒转；现在我站在母亲坟墓旁，想着慈祥的母亲，记忆中她责备我的神情就像毒蛇一样啮咬着我。

LESSON 90

A MOTHER'S GIFT—THE BIBLE

母亲的礼物——《圣经》


1．Remember, love, who gave thee this,

When other days shall come,

When she who had thine earliest kiss,

Sleeps in her narrow home.

Remember! 't was a mother gave

The gift to one she'd die to save!

2．That mother sought a pledge(1) of love,

The holiest for her son,

And from the gifts of God above,

She chose a goodly one;

She chose for her beloved boy,

The source of light, and life, and joy.

3．She bade him keep the gift, that, when

The parting hour should come,

They might have hope to meet again

In an eternal home.

She said his faith(2) in this would be

Sweet incense(3) to her memory.

4．And should the scoffer(4), in his pride,

Laugh that fond faith to scorn,

And bid him cast the pledge aside,

That he from youth had borne,

She bade him pause, and ask his breast

If SHE or HE had loved him best.

5．A parent's blessing on her son

Goes with this holy thing;

The love that would retain the one,

Must to the other cling.

Remember! 't is no idle toy:

A mother's gift! remember, boy.

1．在将来的日子里，

当给你最早亲吻的人，

早已不在人世，

亲爱的，记住，这本书是谁给你的。

不要忘记，这是母亲的礼物，

为了保护你不畏牺牲的母亲的礼物。

2．母亲给孩子的这份礼物，

是最神圣的礼物，是爱的约定。

这礼物是她从神的礼物中选择的，

最美好的礼物。

因为她为她的爱子选择的是，

光明、生命和喜悦的源泉。

3．她说要保存好这份礼物，

当分手的时候到来时，

他们还有希望，

在永恒的天上的家相聚。

她说他的信念，

就是对她最好的纪念。

4．如果有傲慢的嘲笑者，

奚落嘲笑这种信念，

让他把这幼时就坚守的信念，

抛到一边，

她让她停留片刻，问问自己的心，

到底谁更爱他。

5．母亲给儿子的祝福，

永远和这神圣的礼物在一起。

如果爱自己的母亲，

也绝不会忘记另一个。

记住，孩子！这不是无聊的玩具，

这是母亲的礼物！
