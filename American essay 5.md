THE GOOD READER


        朗读者

        1. It is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, that, as he was seated one day in his private room, a written petition[1] was brought to him with the request that it should be immediately read. The King had just returned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some other cause, had so dazzled his eyes that he found it difficult to make out a single word of the writing.

        2. His private secretary happened to be absent; and the soldier who brought the petition could not read. There was a page, or favorite boy servant, waiting in the hall, and upon him the King called. The page was a son of one of the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor reader.

        3. In the first place, he did not articulate[2] distinctly. He huddled his words together in the utterance, as if they were syllables of one long word, which he must get through with as speedily as possible. His pronunciation was bad, and he did not modulate[3] his voice so as to bring out the meaning of what he read. Every sentence was uttered with a dismal monotony[4] of voice, as if it did not differ in any respect from that which preceded it.

        4. “Stop!” said the King, impatiently. “Is it an auctioneer’s list of goods to be sold that you are hurrying over? Send your companion to me.” Another page who stood at the door now entered, and to him the King gave the petition. The second page began by hemming and clearing his throat in such an affected[5] manner that the King jokingly asked him whether he had not slept in the public garden, with the gate open, the night before.

        5. The second page had a good share of self-conceit, however, and so was not greatly confused by the King’s jest. He determined that he would avoid the mistake which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading the petition slowly and with great formality, emphasizing every word, and prolonging the articulation of every syllable. But his manner was so tedious that the King cried out, “Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the elementary sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send me that little girl who is sitting there by the fountain.”

        6. The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daughter of one of the laborers employed by the royal gardener; and she had come to help her father weed the flower beds. It chanced that, like many of the poor people in Prussia, she had received a good education. She was somewhat alarmed when she found herself in the King’s presence, but took courage when the King told her that he only wanted her to read for him, as his eyes were weak.





              7. Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little girl) was fond of reading aloud, and often many of the neighbors would assemble at her father’s house to hear her; those who could not read themselves would come to her, also, with their letters from distant friends or children, and she thus formed the habit of reading various sorts of handwriting promptly and well.

        8. The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly glanced through the opening lines to get some idea of what it was about. As she read, her eyes began to glisten, and her breast to heave. “What is the matter?” asked the King; “don’t you know how to read?” “Oh, yes! sire,” she replied, addressing him with the title usually applied to him: “I will now read it, if you please.”

        9. The two pages wore about to leave the room. “Remain,” said the King. The little girl began to read the petition. It was from a poor widow, whose only son had been drafted[6] to serve in the army, although his health was delicate and his pursuits had been such as to unfit him for military life. His father had been killed in battle, and the son had a strong desire to become a portrait painter.



              10. The writer told her story in a simple, concise[7] manner, that carried to the heart a belief of its truth; and Ernestine read it with so much feeling, and with an articulation so just, in tones so pure and distinct, that when she had finished, the King, into whose eyes the tears had started, exclaimed, “Oh! now I understand what it is all about; but I might never have known, certainly I never should have felt, its meaning had I trusted to these young gentlemen, whom I now dismiss from my service for one year, advising them to occupy their time in learning to read.”

        11. “As for you, my young lady,” continued the King, “I know you will ask no better reward for your trouble than the pleasure of carrying to this poor widow my order for her son’s immediate discharge[8]. Let me see whether you can write as well as you can read. Take this pen, and write as I dictate[9].” He then dictated an order, which Ernestine wrote, and he signed. Calling one of his guards, he bade him go with the girl and see that the order was obeyed.

        12. How much happiness was Ernestine the means of bestowing through her good elocution, united to the happy circumstance that brought it to the knowledge of the King! First, there were her poor neighbors, to whom she could give instruction and entertainment. Then, there was the poor widow who sent the petition, and who not only regained her son, but received through Ernestine an order for him to paint the King’s likeness; so that the poor boy soon rose to great distinction[10], and had more orders than he could attend to. Words could not express[11] his gratitude, and that of his mother, to the little girl.

        13. And Ernestine had, moreover, the satisfaction of aiding her father to rise in the world, so that he became the King’s chief gardener. The King did not forget her, but had her well educated at his own expense. As for the two pages, she was indirectly the means of doing them good, also; for, ashamed of their bad reading, they commenced studying in earnest, till they overcame the faults that had offended the King. Both finally rose to distinction, one as a lawyer, and the other as a statesman; and they owed their advancement in life chiefly to their good elocution.





        NOTES.—Frederick II. of Prussia (b. 1712, d. 1788), or Frederick the Great, as he was called, was one of the greatest of German rulers. He was distinguished for his military exploits, for his wise and just government, and for his literary attainments. He wrote many able works in the French language. Many pleasant anecdotes are told of this king, of which the one given in the lesson is a fair sample.


【中文阅读】

        1．传说，一天，普鲁士国王弗里德里希大帝坐在屋里，他的卫兵给他送来一份书面请愿书。书中注明，请求国王即刻阅读。当时，国王刚刚结束打猎回宫，因为阳光刺眼，或某些其他原因，他头昏眼花，一个字也很难看清。



              2．国王的私人秘书碰巧不在宫内，送来请愿书的卫兵也不识字。当时有位男侍，或者不如说一位乖巧侍童正在大厅当班伺候，国王吩咐他过来。那位侍童是宫廷某位贵族的儿子，可随后证实，他的阅读能力相当糟糕。

        3．一上来，那位侍童发音就不够清晰，那些词语在他嘴里居然咕囔成串，杂乱无章地快速蹦出。听起来，有的词语音节应该很长，可他似乎总是急不可耐地含糊读完。他的发音很糟，无法表现文字的准确含义。与此同时，他所表述的所有话语无不沉闷呆板，毫无抑扬顿挫之感或音调变化，似乎词语间不存在任何差异。

        4．“停下！”国王不耐心地说，“莫非你是公开清单、急于拍卖物品的拍卖师，那么草草念完？把你的同伴叫来！”很快，大厅门口守候的另一位侍童来到国王身边，国王将请愿书交给了他。那侍童装模作样地清了清嗓子，国王诙谐地问他，是不是他昨晚没在公园里过夜，但睡觉时门却整晚没关。

        5．第二位侍童颇为自负，对国王的俏皮话，似乎不太在意。他有心避免前面那位同伴的类似失误，开始朗读起来。他的语速迟缓，太过一本正经，所有词语无不辅以重音，逐个音节拉长拼读，他的朗读那么乏味造作，国王不禁大声呵斥，“停下！你难道是小学生背诵课文？滚出去！不，站好！先把坐在喷泉那边的小姑娘给我叫过来！”

        6．国王点名的那位姑娘是宫廷花师所雇佣人的女儿，那天，她过来帮着父亲给宫廷花圃除草。像普鲁士不少穷人那样，她碰巧接受过良好的教育。听到国王召见自己，她多少有点心存警觉。国王告诉她，由于他眼睛无法阅读，只是让她代劳，她才稍稍鼓起了勇气。

        7．欧内斯廷（小姑娘名字）喜欢高声朗读，不少邻居经常聚集在她家门口听她读书。那些不识字的人亦总乐意找她，他们带来远方朋友或孩子的来信。因此，她便具有阅读不同手写文体、并能迅速准确朗读的能力。

        8．国王将请愿书递给她，她快速地浏览了开篇数行，从而获悉文章的大体印象。她读了不一会儿，眼神炯炯有光，呼吸急速。“怎么回事？”国王问道，“难道你不会读？”“不！陛下，”她以国王的尊称回答，“如果你乐意的话，我会继续。”

        9．两位侍童正准备离开，“站着，别动！”国王下令，姑娘又接着往下读。这份请愿书说的是一位贫苦寡妇的遭遇，她唯一的儿子被抓到军队服兵役，虽然他身虚体弱，志向亦不在行伍。男孩父亲已在一次战役中身亡，那少年还有个梦寐以求的愿望，想成为一名肖像画家。



              10．请愿书作者以质朴简洁的语言，叙述那位寡妇的悲惨遭遇，文章的真情实感让人动容。欧内斯廷满怀深情地读着，她的语言清晰，音调纯正，抑扬顿挫。读完后，国王眼里充满了泪水，他高声叫道：“天呀！我现在才知道怎么回事，假如听信那些年轻贵族的话，我将压根无从了解，准确地说，从来不会感受到这种请愿书的深刻涵义。现在，我要将那些家伙解职一年，让他们好好学习一下如何阅读。”

        11．“至于你，我的孩子，”国王接着说，“相信你会高兴地带上我的手令，立刻解除那可怜寡妇孩子的兵役，我想，假若给你其他任何报酬，亦不会比这更开心吧。我要看看，你是否也能准确书写，像你的阅读那样棒。拿这支笔，写下我口授的话。”他接着口授了一份命令，欧内斯廷记录完毕，国王随后签上自己名字。然后他又吩咐一个卫兵过来，安排他与姑娘一同前去执行他的命令。

        12．通过感情真挚的阅读，获取这种特殊赠与，欧内斯廷简直快乐极了！国王获悉了民情，内心产生共鸣，并最终授于树内。起初，那些贫困邻居们从姑娘那里找到安慰，随后，送出请愿书的那位寡妇不仅能与儿子重新一起生活，还接受了欧内斯廷带来的国王旨意，安排她的儿子前去宫廷为国王画像。不久，那位贫苦人家孩子便迅速得以擢升，并获得更多的发展机会。千言万语无法表达那位少年还有他的寡母对小姑娘欧内斯廷的深深感激之情。

        13．不仅如此，欧内斯廷的父亲后来成为国王的首席园艺师，在世界园林界赢得了声誉，这一点，让欧内斯廷非常自豪。国王并没有忘记这个小姑娘，花钱让她受到最好的教育。至于那两位侍童，她亦间接帮助了他们。由于对自己阅读能力深感羞愧，他们急切想重新获得学习机会。两人通过读书最终弥补了阅读能力的不足，随后皆获取了提升机会，一位做了律师，还有一位成了政治家，他们把生命升华归功于极有裨益的开卷阅读。

THE BLUEBELL


        风铃草

        1. There is a story I have heard—

        A poet learned it of a bird,

        And kept its music every word—





        2. A story of a dim ravine,

        O’er which the towering tree tops lean,

        With one blue rift[12] of sky between;





        3. And there, two thousand years ago,

        A little flower as white as snow

        Swayed[13] in the silence to and fro.





        4. Day after day, with longing eye,

        The floweret watched the narrow sky,

        And fleecy clouds that floated by.





        5. And through the darkness, night by night,

        One gleaming star would climb the height[14],

        And cheer the lonely floweret’s sight.

        6. Thus, watching the blue heavens afar,

        And the rising of its favorite star,

        A slow change came—but not to mar;





        7. For softly o’er its petals[15] white

        There crept a blueness, like the light

        Of skies upon a summer night;





        8. And in its chalice[16], I am told,



              The bonny[17] bell was formed to hold

        A tiny star that gleamed like gold.





        9. Now, little people, sweet and true,

        I find a lesson here for you

        Writ in the floweret’s hell of blue:





        10.The patient child whose watchful eye

        Strives after all things pure and high,

        Shall take their image by and by.

        1．我听说，一只鸟的故事，

        传说久远，诗人辗转获悉，

        他记下，鸟儿啁啾的过去；





        2．有座峡谷，幽深阴暗，

        一株树，高高的树梢弯曲，

        天空，挤出一丝蓝色缝隙；





        3．两千多年前，那处峡谷，

        开着朵小花，洁白妩媚，

        踏着内心脚步，曼妙起舞；





        4．年复一年， 摇曳着企盼，

        晶亮眼瞳，凝视狭仄天空，

        轻柔的云，悠然飘过头顶；





        5．流水的日子，黑暗无边，

        有颗星星，从蓝色缝隙闪入，

        鼓掌欢呼，遗世独立的坚守；





              6．于是，遥远天穹，

        升起一颗，笑脸星辰，

        哪怕改变微小，不会太糟；





        7．花瓣上方，悄然升起

        一抹亮丽，幽蓝夜空里，

        尽情伸展，夏季的深邃致意；





        8．小花，那捧白色圣杯，

        一柄漂亮的花蕊，从容举起，

        金色铃铛，星光四溢的魅力；





        9．可爱的孩子，关于真诚课程，

        一场动容相逢，竟是风铃草

        地狱里，写下的秘密；





        10．学会坚忍，学会敏锐观察，

        仰望那些，纯洁高贵的魂灵，

        耳濡目染，获取精神动力。





        LESSON 3





THE GENTLE HAND


        温柔的手

        Timothy S. Arthur (b. 1809, d. 1885) was born near Newburgh, N.Y., but passed most of his life at Baltimore and Philadelphia. His opportunities for good schooling were quite limited, and he may be considered a self-educated man. He was the author of more than a hundred volumes, principally novels of a domestic and moral tone, and of many shorter tales—magazine articles, etc. “Ten Nights in a Barroom,” and “Three Years in a Mantrap,” are among his best known works.





        1. When and where it matters not now to relate—but once upon a time, as I was passing through a thinly peopled district of country, night came down upon me almost unawares. Being on foot, I could not hope to gain the village toward which my steps were directed, until a late hour; and I therefore preferred seeking shelter and a night’s lodging at the first humble dwelling that presented itself.

        2. Dusky twilight was giving place to deeper shadows, when I found myself in the vicinity[18] of a dwelling, from the small uncurtained windows of which the light shone with a pleasant promise of good cheer and comfort. The house stood within an inclosure, and a short distance from the road along which I was moving with wearied feet.

        3. Turning aside, and passing through the ill-hung gate, I approached the dwelling. Slowly the gate swung on its wooden hinges, and the rattle of its latch, in closing, did not disturb the air until I had nearly reached the porch in front of the house, in which a slender girl, who had noticed my entrance, stood awaiting my arrival.

        4. A deep, quick bark answered, almost like an echo, the sound of the shutting gate, and, sudden as an apparition, the form of an immense dog loomed in the doorway. At the instant when he was about to spring, a light hand was laid upon his shaggy neck, and a low word spoken.

        5. “Go in, Tiger,” said the girl, not in a voice of authority, yet in her gentle tones was the consciousness that she would be obeyed; and, as she spoke, she lightly bore upon the animal with her hand, and he turned away and disappeared within the dwelling.

        6. “Who’s that?” A rough voice asked the question; and now a heavy-looking man took the dog’s place in the door.

        7. “How far is it to G—?” I asked, not deeming it best to say, in the beginning, that I sought a resting place for the night.

        8. “To G—!” growled the man, but not so harshly as at first. “It’s good six miles from here.”

        9. “A long distance; and I’m a stranger and on foot,” said I. “If you can make room for me until morning, I will be very thankful.”

        10. I saw the girl’s hand move quickly up his arm, until it rested on his shoulder, and now she leaned to him still closer.



              11. “Come in. We’ll try what can be done for you.” There was a change in the man’s voice that made me wonder. I entered a large room, in which blazed a brisk fire. Before the fire sat two stout lads, who turned upon me their heavy eyes, with no very welcome greeting. A middle-aged woman was standing at a table, and two children were amusing themselves with a kitten on the floor.

        12. “A stranger, mother,” said the man who had given me so rude a greeting at the door; “and he wants us to let him stay all night.”

        13. The woman looked at me doubtingly for a few moments, and then replied coldly, “We don’t keep a public house.”

        14. “I’m aware of that, ma’am,” said I; “but night has overtaken me, and it’s a long way yet to G—.”

        15. “Too far for a tired man to go on foot,” said the master of the house, kindly, “so it’s no use talking about it, mother; we must give him a bed.”

        16. So unobtrusively[19] that I scarce noticed the movement, the girl had drawn to her mother’s side. What she said to her I did not hear, for the brief words were uttered in a low voice; but I noticed, as she spoke, one small, fair hand rested on the woman’s hand.

        17. Was there magic in that touch? The woman’s repulsive[20] aspect changed into one of kindly welcome, and she said, “Yes, it’s a long way to G—. I guess we can find a place for him.”

        18. Many times more during that evening, did I observe the magic power of that hand and voice—the one gentle yet potent[21] as the other. On the next morning, breakfast being over, I was preparing to take my departure when my host[22] informed me that if I would wait for half an hour he would give me a ride in his wagon to G—, as business required him to go there. I was very well pleased to accept of the invitation.

        19. In due time, the farmer’s wagon was driven into the road before the house, and I was invited to get in. I noticed the horse as a rough-looking Canadian pony, with a certain air of stubborn endurance. As the farmer took his seat by my side, the family came to the door to see us off.

        20. “Dick!” said the farmer in a peremptory[23] voice, giving the rein a quick jerk as he spoke. But Dick moved not a step. “Dick! you vagabond! get up.” And the farmer’s whip cracked sharply by the pony’s ear.

        21. It availed[24] not, however, this second appeal. Dick stood firmly disobedient. Next the whip was brought down upon him with an impatient hand; but the pony only reared up a little. Fast and sharp the strokes were next dealt to the number of half a dozen. The man might as well have beaten the wagon, for all his end was gained.

        22. A stout lad now came out into the road, and, catching Dick by the bridle, jerked him forward, using, at the same time, the customary language on such occasions, but Dick met this new ally[25] with increased stubbornness, planting his fore feet more firmly and at a sharper angle with the ground.

        23. The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side of the head with his clinched hand, and jerked cruelly at his bridle. It availed nothing, however; Dick was not to be wrought upon by any such arguments.



              24. “Don’t do so, John!” I turned my head as the maiden’s sweet voice reached my ear. She was passing through the gate into the road, and in the next moment had taken hold of the lad and drawn him away from the animal. No strength was exerted in this; she took hold of his arm, and he obeyed her wish as readily as if he had no thought beyond her gratification.

        25. And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony’s neck, and a single low word spoken. How instantly were the tense[26] muscles relaxed[27]—how quickly the stubborn air vanished!

        26. “Poor Dick!” said the maiden, as she stroked his neck lightly, or softly patted it with a childlike hand. “Now, go along, you provoking fellow!” she added, in a half-chiding[28], yet affectionate voice, as she drew up the bridle.

        27. The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head against her arm for an instant or two; then, pricking up his ears, he started off at a light, cheerful trot, and went on his way as freely as if no silly crotchet[29] had ever entered his stubborn brain.

        28. “What a wonderful power that hand possesses!” said I, speaking to my companion, as we rode away.

        29. He looked at me for a moment, as if my remark had occasioned surprise. Then a light came into his countenance, and he said briefly, “She’s good! Everybody and everything loves her.”

        30. Was that, indeed, the secret of her power? Was the quality of her soul perceived in the impression of her hand, even by brute beasts! The father’s explanation was doubtless the true one. Yet have I ever since wondered, and still do wonder, at the potency which lay in that maiden’s magic touch. I have seen something of the same power, showing itself in the loving and the good, but never to the extent as instanced[30] in her, whom, for want of a better name, I must still call “Gentle Hand.”

        1．究竟什么时间、地点，现在看来似乎无关紧要——姑且算是从前吧，当我走过一处人烟稀少的地区，不知不觉间，夜幕降临了。由于步行，我不可能指望找到一处乡镇或村庄。又过了一个时辰，我急切地想找处地方过夜，没别的，最先撞见的地方，无论怎样粗鄙简陋，对付一晚足矣。



              2．昏暗灯火来自深不可测的黑暗，我突然发现附近有户人家，从那扇光秃秃的窗口里，似乎感觉到灯火里透出喜悦的安详。屋子四周有栅栏，离我走的路很近，那时，我可真是走得太累了。

        3．走下路，跨过那扇歪扭的大门，我走向那处屋子。大门在木质铰链上慢慢晃动，门闩的吱呀声悄无声息，直到最后关门才发出轻微声响。待我走到房前走廊时，才看到一位身材修长的姑娘站在那里，显然，刚才她听到了我的脚步。

        4．门甫关上，旋即响起一声低沉的狗吠，一条体型硕大的狗幽灵般出现在我的身边。就在它立马扑过来的刹那，一只手轻轻搭在那只狗毛发蓬松的脖颈。

        5．“虎子，进去，”姑娘低声说道，声音并不威严，但温柔中含有不得不服从的暗示，与此同时，她轻轻地拍打那狗几下，于是那狗转身闪进屋内。

        6．“你是谁？”一个粗厉声音响起，一位脸色阴沉的男人在狗的身后闪出。

        7．“请问，这里离G地还有多远？”我问道，乍开口，才觉得并不合适，那时的我不过想找个过夜的地方。

        8．“到G地去，”那男人大声地说，言语间却少了最初的苛厉，“从这到那还有不近的六英里路呢。”

        9．“路真够远的，我是步行来的，一个过路客，”我说，“如果你们让我在这歇上一晚，我真是感激不尽。”

        10．我看见那姑娘的手迅速上移，最后搭在那男人肩膀上，现在她贴那男人更近了点。

        11．“进来吧，看看我们能给你帮上什么忙。”那男人语气的变化让我有点喜出望外。我走进房间，房间很宽敞，火苗轻快地跳跃着。火堆边坐着两位粗硕身材的人，满脸阴沉地打量着我，明显带着不快的神情。一位中年妇女站在桌子旁边，两个孩子在地上逗着小猫玩。

        12．“妈妈，这位过路客，”刚才在门口粗鲁地与我打招呼的那位男人说道，“他想在这里过上一夜。”

        13．那妇人狐疑地打量我片刻，冷淡地说，“我们这没有客房。”

        14．“我，我知道，夫人，”我说，“不过，天太晚了，去G地路实在太远了。”



        15．“他走得太累了，前面的路那么远，”那好心的姑娘接着说，“别说了，妈妈，我们得给他准备个睡觉的地方。”

        16．起初，我还真没注意到，悄无声息地，那姑娘仄到她妈妈身边，那些话语很轻，我听不见她对母亲说了什么，不过，我留意到，那姑娘说话的当口，她那小巧美丽的手已搭在那妇人的手上。



              17．这就是触摸的神奇？那妇人反感冷淡的口吻转瞬变得柔和亲近，“是的，去G地的路还远着呢，我想，我们是得给他安排住下。”

        18．就在那个晚上，我确实留心到那双手、那个声音的神奇——温柔中透出强势力量。次日清早，早饭后，我打算告辞，男主人突然告诉我，如果我可以等半个时辰的话，他可以捎带我去G地，他要赶着马车去G地办事。我自然非常高兴地接受了他的好意。

        19．约定的时间到了，那农夫的马车来到屋前路上，我受邀上车后，这才看见那匹驾辕的马驹，那马驹面部粗糙，属于加拿大品种，具有顽强忍耐的优良品性。农夫上了车，坐在我身边，全家人走出门来给我们送行。

        20、“狄克！”那农夫严厉地呵斥，一边猛地拉动缰绳，狄克竟然没有挪步，“狄克！你这个懒鬼！快走呀。”农夫鞭子在小马耳边尖锐地乍响。

        21．依然毫不奏效。接下来，农夫语气变得委婉甚至恳求，小马驹还是无动于衷。然后，主人急躁的鞭子甩在了狄克身上，那马驹只是稍稍后退，接着又来了六七下快速猛烈的鞭笞，那农夫如果早知道他最终束手无策，还不如起先就鞭打那马车罢。

        22．一位身材粗硕的妇人走过来，她抓住马笼头猛地往前拉，嘴里不停叨唠类似场合那些粗鄙的话，但狄克愈发倔犟，死活不走，甚至还将它的前蹄翘起，死死地抵住地面。

        23．这会儿，那位不耐烦的男孩用钳子般手掌猛力撞击狄克头部，然后死命猛拽马的笼头，毫不奏效，狄克不会在这样暴力下尥开蹄子。

        24．“约翰，别这样！”我一转头，那位姑娘的温柔声音传了过来。

        她正迈过大门，来到路上。姑娘一把抓住那莽撞的家伙，将他从狄克身边甩开。她毫不费力地抓住了他的一只胳膊，他好像也相当乐意地与其配合，好像压根没有忤逆她的意思。

        25．眼前，那只温柔的手轻轻放在小马驹的脖颈上，姑娘轻声慢语地对它说话。不过转眼间，狄克紧张的肌肉已经松弛，僵持的坚冰终于打破。

        26．“可怜的狄克，”那姑娘一边说，一边轻轻拍着小马驹的脖颈，或者不如说，用那满怀柔情的孩子般手拍打狄克，“该走了，你这让人生气的孩子！”她的话语中夹杂责备，亦不乏温情脉脉，说话间，她还提了提笼头。

        27．狄克朝她转过身来，用头朝她胳膊蹭动片刻，然后竖立耳朵，轻快地跑起碎步，接着，尥开蹄子跑开了，好像刚才不曾有任何怪异的念头盘踞在它那固执的小脑瓜里。



              28．马车跑起来了，“手，该有多么神奇！”我对身边的人说道。

        29．农夫注视了我片刻，好像我的话使他偶发惊奇，他的脸上闪过一丝喜悦，却只说了句，“她心地仁慈，这里的人和那些牲口都喜欢她。”

        30．的确，难道她有神奇力量的秘密？抑或她的灵魂高贵？这位父亲的话无疑道出了真相，从那以后，我确实想知道，甚至今天，似乎更想弄明白，那姑娘轻抚的手里究竟存在什么样的神奇魔力。我见过同样的力量诉求，从容地表达爱恋与善行，但从未见过类似这位姑娘手里升起的奇迹，她给我内心带来了惊悚震撼。如果让我用贴切的词语形容，我宁愿称呼她为“温柔的手”。

THE GRANDFATHER


        爷 爷

        Charles G. Eastman (b. 1816, d.1861) was born in Maine, but removed at an early age to Vermont, where he was connected with the press at Burlington, Woodstock, and Montpelier. He published a volume of poems in 1848, written in a happy lyric and ballad style, and faithfully portraying rural life in New England.





        1. The farmer sat in his easy-chair

        Smoking his pipe of clay,

        While his hale[31] old wife with busy care,

        Was clearing the dinner away;

        A sweet little girl with fine blue eyes,

        On her grandfather’s knee, was catching flies.





        2. The old man laid his hand on her head,

        With a tear on his wrinkled face,

        He thought how often her mother, dead,

        Had sat in the selfsame place;

        As the tear stole down from his half-shut eye,

        “Don’t smoke!” said the child, “how it makes you cry!”





        3. The house dog lay stretched out on the floor,

        Where the shade, afternoons, used to steal;

        The busy old wife by the open door

        Was turning the spinning wheel,

        And the old brass clock on the manteltree[32]

        Had plodded[33] along to almost three.





        4. Still the farmer sat in his easy-chair,

        While close to his heaving[34] breast

        The moistened brow and the cheek so fair

        Of his sweet grandchild were pressed;

        His head bent down, all her soft hair lay;

        Fast asleep were they both on that summer day.

         他呼吸急促，神色安详，

         饱经沧桑的脸颊沾满泪渍，

         怀里抱着他可爱的孙女，

         头发蓬松，脑袋耷拉，

         夏日午后，祖孙俩都睡着啦。





        LESSON 5





A BOY ON A FARM


        农场少年

        Charles Dudley Warner (b. 1829,—d.1900) was born at Plainfield, Mass. In 1851 he graduated at Hamilton College, and in 1856 was admitted to the bar at Philadelphia, but moved to Chicago to practice his profession. There he remained until 1860, when he became connected with the press at Hartford, Conn., and has ever since devoted himself to literature. “My Summer in a Garden,” “Saunterings,” and “Backlog Studies” are his best known works. The following extract is from “Being a Boy.”





        1. Say what you will about the general usefulness of boys, it is my impression that a farm without a boy would very soon come to grief. What the boy does is the life of the farm. He is the factotum[35], always in demand, always expected to do the thousand indispensable[36] things that nobody else will do. Upon him fall all the odds and ends, the most difficult things.

        2. After everybody else is through, he has to finish up. His work is like a woman’s,—perpetually[37] waiting on others. Everybody knows how much easier it is to eat a good dinner than it is to wash the dishes afterwards. Consider what a boy on a farm is required to do,—things that must be done, or life would actually stop.

        3. It is understood, in the first place, that he is to do all the errands, to go to the store, to the post office, and to carry all sorts of messages. If he had as many legs as a centiped[38], they would tire before night. His two short limbs seem to him entirely inadequate to the task. He would like to have as many legs as a wheel has spokes, and rotate about in the same way.

        4. This he sometimes tries to do; and the people who have seen him “turning cart wheels” along the side of the road, have supposed that he was amusing himself and idling his time; he was only trying to invent a new mode of locomotion, so that he could economize[39] his legs, and do his errands with greater dispatch[40].

        5. He practices standing on his head, in order to accustom himself to any position. Leapfrog is one of his methods of getting over the ground quickly. He would willingly go an errand any distance if he could leapfrog it with a few other boys.

        6. He has a natural genius for combining pleasure with business. This is the reason why, when he is sent to the spring for a pitcher of water, he is absent so long; for he stops to poke the frog that sits on the stone, or, if there is a penstock[41], to put his hand over the spout, and squirt the water a little while.



              7. He is the one who spreads the grass when the men have cut it; he mows it away in the barn; he rides the horse, to cultivate the corn, up and down the hot, weary rows; he picks up the potatoes when they are dug; he drives the cows night and morning; he brings wood and water, and splits kindling; he gets up the horse, and puts out the horse; whether he is in the house or out of it, there is always something for him to do.

        8. Just before the school in winter he shovels paths; in summer he turns the grindstone. He knows where there are lots of wintergreens and sweet flags, but instead of going for them, he is to stay indoors and pare apples, and stone raisins, and pound something in a mortar. And yet, with his mind full of schemes of what he would like to do, and his hands full of occupations, he is an idle boy, who has nothing to busy himself with but school and chores[42]!

        9. He would gladly do all the work if somebody else would do the chores, he thinks; and yet I doubt if any boy ever amounted to anything in the world, or was of much use as a man, who did not enjoy the advantages of a liberal education in the way of chores.

        查尔斯 · 达德利 · 沃纳（1829～1900）出生于美国马萨诸塞州麦斯 · 普兰菲尔德。1851年，他从汉密尔顿学院毕业。1856年获取资格进入费城律师界，然后搬迁到芝加哥从事律师见习。1860年，他离开芝加哥，与康涅狄格州首府哈特福德出版界联系密切，随后致力投身文学事业。沃纳闻名于世的作品包括《花园的夏天》、《悠闲漫步》和《滞压工作研究》。下列节选自他的《少年有担当》。





        1. 你认为农场少年能做什么？依我看，没有少年的农场真的会非常糟糕。他们在农场生活里须臾不可少，他们是农场的闲杂总管，男女老少大呼小叫的左膀右臂。在农场里，千头万绪的事零星琐碎，最为困难的事棘手庞杂，无一例外都落到他们肩上，其他人委实无法帮忙。

        2. 别人忙完了活儿，农场少年得去扫尾，有点像一直忙着为别人做嫁衣的嫁娘，总得听从他人使唤。毋庸置疑，外出赴宴享受美味大餐永远比餐后洗碗刷碟轻松太多太多。只要想象一下农场少年的活儿，那些需要做的，可又不得不做的，否则，生活将无法继续下去。

        3. 首先，众所周知，农场少年得去做完所有跑腿的活计，他要跑商店、上邮局、送消息、传信件，即使他拥有蜈蚣一样的几十条腿，晚上上床躺倒前亦会累个半死。每天指望两条细腿跑路干活，看来远远不够，他们恨不得长有自行车轮毂上众多辐条般的腿，恐怕还要连轴转个不停。



              4. 有时，农场少年兴冲冲地到处奔跑，旁人看来，他们骑车忙着到处乱窜，或许还有人认为，他们纯粹是玩酷一族或借此消磨时光。其实，他们不过想创造某种新型的运动方式，以便节省腿力，完成更多支派或差遣。

        5. 农场少年还得练习倒立，以使自己习惯任何不拘一格的运动姿势。蛙跳行进堪称快捷走完路程的美妙方法之一。当然，能与其他几个狐朋狗友互动互乐更好，这样的话，他挺乐意四下跑腿，路再远似乎也毫不在乎。

        6. 忙中作乐，对农场少年来说，似乎是与生俱来的。如果让他去泉边汲水，很长时间他都不会回来。他总会时而停留片刻，或者戳捣一番趴在青石上的青蛙。碰到木槽水管之类，他非得将手伸到木槽下，乐不可支地玩会水后才心满意足地回家。

        7. 大人们割下田里的草，农场少年需要将青草摊开曝晒，还要将谷仓里干草堆成跺。他还要骑马、种玉米，上上下下，整天屁颠颠地左右逢源。马铃薯该收了，他跟着收庄稼；清晨，他赶着牛群外出放牧；黄昏，他牵着牛群打道回府；他还要拣柴、提水、劈柴、生火、喂马、洗马、拴马、遛马……家里家外，每天的事情总也做不完。

        8. 冬天开学前，农场少年先要铲除路上的坚冰积雪，夏天该找出磨石磨刀霍霍。他知道哪里的鹿蹄草最多，哪里的白菖蒲最甜，不过，他可不能急着出门摘采；他还得待在家里削苹果，将葡萄干晾晒在石片上，把食材放进研钵臼烂。他满脑子装满大大小小需要做的事，手上更是根本闲不住，难道他还能游手好闲？除去学业和家里家外的繁琐杂活，他哪有心思想到自己。

        9. 农场少年觉得，如果有人愿意揽下这些庞杂琐碎，他宁愿去做那些正儿八经的活儿。不过，我怀疑，如果一个少年不喜欢受益于这种干杂活的自由式教育，他将来是否能在世上找到自己可干点什么，能否做一个尽量有用之人。





        LESSON 6





THE SINGING LESSON


        唱歌课

        Jean Ingelow (b. 1830, d.1897) was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, England. Her fame as a poetess was at once established upon the publication of her “Poems” in 1863; since which time several other volumes have appeared. The most generally admired of her poems are “Songs of Seven” and “The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire,” She has also written several successful novels, of which, “Off the Skelligs” is the most popular. “Stories Told to a Child,” “The Cumberers,” “Poor Mat,” “Studies for Stories,” and “Mopsa, the Fairy” are also well known. Miss Ingelow resided in London, England, and spent much of her time in deeds of charity.

        1. A nightingale made a mistake;

        She sang a few notes out of tune:

        Her heart was ready to break,

        And she hid away from the moon.

        She wrung her claws, poor thing,

        But was far too proud to weep;

        She tucked her head under her wing,

        And pretended to be asleep.





        2. A lark, arm in arm with a thrush,

        Came sauntering[43] up to the place;

        The nightingale felt herself blush,

        Though feathers hid her face;

        She knew they had heard her song,

        She felt them snicker[44] and sneer;

        She thought that life was too long,

        And wished she could skip a year.





        3. “O nightingale!” cooed a dove;

        “O nightingale! what’s the use?

        You bird of beauty and love,

        Why behave like a goose?

        Don’t sulk away from our sight,

        Like a common, contemptible fowl;

        You bird of joy and delight,

        Why behave like an owl?





        4. “Only think of all you have done;

        Only think of all you can do;

        A false note is really fun

        From such a bird as you!

        Lift up your proud little crest[45],

        Open your musical beak;

        Other birds have to do their best,

        You need only to speak!”

        5. The nightingale shyly took

        Her head from under her wing,

        And, giving the dove a look,

        Straightway began to sing.

        There was never a bird could pass;

        The night was divinely[46] calm;

        And the people stood on the grass

        To hear that wonderful psalm.





        6. The nightingale did not care,

        She only sang to the skies;

        Her song ascended there,

        And there she fixed her eyes.

        The people that stood below

        She knew but little about;

        And this tale has a moral[47], I know,

        If you’ll try and find it out.





        NOTE.—The nightingale is a small bird, about six inches in length, with a coat of dark-brown feathers above and of grayish, white beneath. Its voice is astonishingly strong and sweet, and, when wild, it usually sings throughout the evening and night from April to the middle of summer. The bird is common in Europe, but is not found in America.

        1．一只夜莺，露了丑，

        刚开口唱歌，就跑了调，

        它的心儿，就要碎了，

        连忙赶紧，躲开月亮。

        不小心还扭了脚，这可怜家伙，

        是否太过骄傲，大哭一场，

        反正，它将头蜷缩翼翅下，

        装模作样地睡着了。





        2．云雀和画眉，肩并肩，

        蹒跚走过来，查看究竟，

        夜莺捂住，羞红的脸，

        虽然羽毛遮住，心中胆怯，

        它知道，鸟儿听见自己歌唱，

        叽喳嘲笑，犹如芒刺，

        它讨厌憎恨，时光漫长，

        一年眨眼过去，该有多棒！





        3．“哦，夜莺”，一只鸽子咕咕叫，

        “有什么大事不得了？

        你那么漂亮，又可爱，

        何必，像那些粗鄙家鹅？

        别躲在旮旯里，生闷气，

        也不要小鸡肚肠，没度量，

        你应该，开心更快乐，

        为什么，不学学猫头鹰？





        4．“只要想一想，你所做的，

        再思忖看看，你能做的，

        唱错了调，无关紧要，

        权当有趣，一笑别过。



              耸起你，那骄傲鸟冠，

        打开你，美丽的喙角，

        鸟儿们，竭力帮助你，

        不妨，亮开歌喉再唱歌。”





        5． 夜莺，羞愧地，

        从翼翅里，抬起头，

        感激中，看了鸽子一眼，

        蓦然间，亮开嗓门，

        鸟儿，纷纷飞来驻足，

        夜晚，霎时庄严静穆，

        草地上，人群安静伫立，

        聆听那，质朴无华的圣歌。





        6．夜莺，不再害怕，

        它的歌声，渐次上扬回旋，

        它的目光，悠然攀升，

        伴随着，响彻入云骄傲，

        歌声拂过，娴静无边夜色。

        夜莺，或许茫然不知，

        这篇故事，包含人生箴言，

        只要尝试，奇迹不难发现。





        LESSON 7





DO NOT MEDDLE


        请别多管闲事

        1. About twenty years ago there lived a singular gentleman in the Old Hall among the elm trees. He was about three-score years of age, very rich, and somewhat odd in many of his habits, but for generosity and benevolence he had no equal.

        2. No poor cottager stood in need of comforts, which he was not ready to supply; no sick man or woman languished[48] for want of his assistance; and not even a beggar, unless a known impostor[49], went empty-handed from the Hall. Like the village pastor described in Goldsmith’s poem of “The Deserted Village,”





        “His house was known to all the vagrant train;

        He chid their wand’rings, but relieved their pain;

        The long-remembered beggar was his guest,

        Whose beard descending swept his aged breast.”





        3. Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted a boy to wait upon him at table, and to attend him in different ways, for he was very fond of young people. But much as he liked the society of the young, he had a great aversion[50] to that curiosity in which many young people are apt to indulge[51]. He used to say, “The boy who will peep into a drawer will be tempted to take something out of it; and he who will steal a penny in his youth will steal a pound[52] in his manhood.”

        4. No sooner was it known that the old gentleman was in want of a boy than twenty applications[53] were made for the situation; but he determined not to engage anyone until he had in some way ascertained that he did not possess a curious, prying disposition.

        5. On Monday morning seven lads, dressed in their Sunday clothes, with bright and happy faces, made their appearance at the Hall, each of them desiring to obtain the situation. Now the old gentleman, being of a singular disposition,had prepared a room in such a way that he might easily know if any of the young people who applied were given to meddle unnecessarily with things around them, or to peep into cupboards and drawers. He took care that the lads who were then at Elm Tree Hall should be shown into this room one after another.



              6. And first, Charles Brown was sent into the room, and told that he would have to wait a little. So Charles sat down on a chair near the door. For some time he was very quiet, and looked about him; but there seemed to be so many curious things in the room that at last he got up to peep at them.

        7. On the table was placed a dish cover, and Charles wanted sadly to know what was under it, but he felt afraid of lifting it up. Bad habits are strong things; and, as Charles was of a curious disposition, he could not withstand the temptation of taking one peep. So he lifted up the cover.

        8. This turned out to be a sad affair; for under the dish cover was a heap of very light feathers; part of the feathers, drawn up by a current of air, flew about the room, and Charles, in his fright, putting the cover down hastily, puffed the rest of them off the table.

        9. What was to be done? Charles began to pick up the feathers one by one; but the old gentleman, who was in an adjoining room, hearing a scuffle, and guessing the cause of it, entered the room, to the consternation[54] of Charles Brown, who was very soon dismissed as a boy who had not principle[55] enough to resist even a slight temptation.

        10. When the room was once more arranged, Henry Wilkins was placed there until such time as he should be sent for. No sooner was he left to himself than his attention was attracted by a plate of fine, ripe cherries. Now Henry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and he thought it would be impossible to miss one cherry among so many. He looked and longed, and longed and looked, for some time, and just as he had got off his seat to take one, he heard, as he thought, a foot coming to the door; but no, it was a false alarm.

        11. Taking fresh courage, he went cautiously and took a very fine cherry, for he was determined to take but one, and put it into his mouth. It was excellent; and then he persuaded himself that he ran no risk in taking another; this he did, and hastily popped it into his mouth.

        12. Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artificial[56] cherries at the top of the others, filled with Cayenne pepper; one of these Henry had unfortunately taken, and it made his month smart and burn most intolerably[57]. The old gentleman heard him coughing, and knew very well what was the matter. The boy that would take what did not belong to him, if no more than a cherry, was not the boy for him. Henry Wilkins was sent about his business without delay, with his mouth almost as hot as if he had put a burning coal in to it.

        13. Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room and left to himself; but he had not been there ten minutes before he began to move from one place to another. He was of a bold, resolute temper, but not overburdened with principle; for if he could have opened every cupboard, closet, and drawer in the house, without being found out, he would have done it directly.

        14. Having looked around the room, he noticed a drawer to the table, and made up his mind to peep therein. But no sooner did he lay hold of the drawer knob than he set a large bell ringing, which was concealed under the table. The old gentleman immediately answered the summons[58], and entered the room.



              15. Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the bell, that all his impudence could not support him. He looked as though anyone might knock him down with a feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had rung the bell because he wanted anything. Rufus was much confused,and stammered, and tried to excuse himself, but all to no purpose, for it did not prevent him from being ordered off the premises.

        16. George Jones was then shown into the room by an old steward; and being of a cautious disposition, he touched nothing, but only looked at the things about him. At last he saw that a closet door was a little open, and, thinking it would be impossible for anyone to know that he had opened it a little more, he very cautiously opened it an inch farther, looking down at the bottom of the door, that it might not catch against anything and make a noise.

        17. Now had he looked at the top, instead of the bottom, it might have been better for him; for to the top of the door was fastened a plug, which filled up the hole of a small barrel of shot. He ventured to open the door another inch, and then another, till, the plug being pulled out of the barrel, the leaden shot began to pour out at a strange rate. At the bottom of the closet was placed a tin pan, and the shot falling upon this pan made such a clatter that George was frightened half out of his senses.

        18. The old gentleman soon came into the room to inquire what was the matter, and there he found George nearly as pale as a sheet. George was soon dismissed.

        19. It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put into the room. The other boys had been sent to their homes by different ways, and no one knew what the experience[59] of the other had been in the room of trial.

        20. On the table stood a small round box, with a screw top to it, and Albert, thinking it contained something curious, could not be easy without unscrewing the top; but no sooner did he do this than out bounced an artificial snake, full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. He started back, and uttered a scream which brought the old gentleman to his elbow. There stood Albert, with the bottom of the box in one hand, the top in the other, and the snake on the floor.

        21. “Come, come,” said the old gentleman, “one snake is quite enough to have in the house at a time; therefore, the sooner you are gone the better.” With that he dismissed him, without waiting a moment for his reply.

        22. William Smith next entered the room, and being left alone soon began to amuse himself in looking at the curiosities around him. William was not only curious and prying, but dishonest, too, and observing that the key was left in the drawer of a bookcase, he stepped on tiptoe in that direction. The key had a wire fastened to it, which communicated with an electrical machine, and William received such a shock as he was not likely to forget. No sooner did he sufficiently recover himself to walk, than he was told to leave the house, and let other people lock and unlock their own drawers.

        23. The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he was left in the room full twenty minutes, he never during that time stirred from his chair. Harry had eyes in his head as well as the others, but he had more integrity[60] in his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the drawer knob, the closet door, the round box, nor the key tempted him to rise from his feet; and the consequence was that, in half an hour after, he was engaged in the service of the old gentleman at Elm Tree Hall. He followed his good old master to his grave, and received a large legacy[61] for his upright conduct in his service.

        1．大约20年前，一处榆树簇拥的古老庄园里，住着一位超凡脱俗的乡间绅士。他约莫60来岁，非常富有，行为举止有点乖张，但他为人慷慨，处事宽宏大方，而且宅心仁厚，无人堪比。

        2．无论遇见贫苦潦倒的佃农雇工，或者憔悴羸弱的乡邻妇孺，甚至衣衫褴褛的乞丐，他总是不吝钱财，鼎力相助。只有那些恶名昭彰的诈骗之徒，才会两手空空地离开。正如戈德史密斯诗歌《被抛弃的村庄》中曾经描述的那样，“他的门口，流浪汉排成了长队，他呵斥那些人的原罪，却倾心减除他们痛苦，甚至有位记忆苍老的乞丐，简直成为他的座上客，那老人髯须灰白，垂到皱纹如縠的胸间。”

        3．当时，那位年迈绅士正需要一名伺童照料他的生活起居，他很喜爱年轻人。然而，他愈喜欢年轻人的社会，就愈憎恶不少年轻人深陷五花八门的走火入魔。他总是说，“喜欢窥探他人抽屉的孩子，不由自主总想拿走点东西。俗语说得好：‘少时偷针，大时偷金’。”

        4．那位乡绅要找伺童的消息一经传开，二十来位想要为自己孩子谋就职位的乡邻纷纷挤上门来。老人执意不愿雇用，他心里明白，唯有通过某种程序以验证雇佣孩子是否具有良好的品格，那些孩子应该既不好奇心太盛，亦不爱多管闲事，他才能彻底放心。

        5．一个周一的早晨，七名少年穿上礼拜的衣服，脸上洋溢着开心幸福的笑容，聚集到那座庄园门口。人人都急切获得那个职位。那性格怪异的老人早已备好一处房间，以待更好察看应聘少年的品行，检测他们是否安分守己，是否不窥探自己不该知道的东西。他下令将那些站在榆树庄园里的少年逐一领进那处房间。

        6．查尔斯·布朗第一个被带进房间，有人告诉他，让他在房间里稍等片刻。于是查尔斯在门边椅子上坐下，刚开始，他一声不吭，环顾四周，房间里好玩东西实在诱惑太多，最后，他忍不住站起来到处查看。

        7．一个盘子倒扣桌上，查尔斯急切想弄清盘子下究竟藏有什么东西，可又害怕将盘子掀开。查尔斯的坏习惯看来根深蒂固，与好奇心不相上下，他实在抵挡不住窥探一眼的诱惑，于是将盘子倒翻过来，这下够糟了，原来盘子下堆着一簇细小羽毛。在气流的裹挟下，有的羽毛被吹开，忽悠悠到处乱飘。恐惧中的查尔斯匆忙将盘子盖上，还没忘记顺嘴吹走桌上剩下的细绒。



              下步该做什么？查尔斯迅速逐一拣拾羽绒。此刻，那位老人走进房间，原来他就在隔壁，听到了这边的手忙脚乱，猜到了事情的原委经过。没有足够定力的少年，竟然无法抵制如此微小的诱惑。使查尔斯·布朗大为惊愕的是，他很快就被打发回家。

        10．当房间再度安排妥当，亨利·威尔金斯被带了进来。他亦得单独待上一段时间。片刻工夫，看到一盘鲜艳熟透的莓果，他的眼球就错不开了。亨利喜爱莓果，称得上情有独钟。他暗中思忖，这么大一盘莓果，不品咂上一颗似乎绝无可能。他左盯右看，心里七上八下。就在他站起来，准备抓起一颗，他听见，不，他以为有脚步声走来，原来却是闹钟滴嗒声，弄得他虚惊一场。

        11．亨利重新鼓起勇气，小心翼翼走上前，抓了只艳红的果子。原本他只拿一颗，但品尝后发现，那莓果味道实在太好，他不停地说服自己，绝不能冒险再拿一颗，然而还是伸出了手。仓促中，果实“砰”的一声落进他的嘴里。

        12．原来，老人在莓果上放了几颗人造果实，里面夹杂辣椒或胡椒面，亨利不巧拿到那颗假果，刚进口，那辛辣味道让他实在无法忍受。老人听见隔壁咳嗽声，便已洞悉这边发生的事情。那可怜的少年，拿取不属于自己的东西，尽管不过一颗莓子，对老人来说，也就完全失去了聘用意义。威尔金斯毫不迟延地被带了出去，当时他的口腔冒火，嘴里像塞了块燃煤。

        13．随后，鲁弗斯 · 威尔森被吩咐走进房间。不到十分钟，他就开始在房间里转悠开了。他胆子很大，性格果敢，对诚信的原则问题似乎不太介意，如果不被发现的话，或许房间内每扇橱柜、壁柜甚至抽屉皆能被他逐一打开，无须任何踌躇或犹豫。

        14．四周看看，鲁弗斯看到了桌子抽屉，他一心想知道里面装有什么。不料他刚刚捏住抽屉把手，旋即铃声大作，原来那响铃竟隐蔽地装在桌下。听到铃声，老人迅速走进房间。

        15．鲁弗斯被突如其来的铃声完全弄懵了，他的所有鲁莽无法自圆其说。他看起来那么不堪一击，似乎一根羽毛也能将其击倒。老人问他是否需要什么才揿动响铃，尴尬的鲁弗斯结结巴巴，不知所措，张口还想辩解什么，却又莫衷一是，理由愈发站不住脚，最终还是没能逃脱被要求离开的结局。



              16．乔治·琼斯由一位老管家领进房间，他生性谨慎小心，不敢触动屋内任何物品，只用眼光横扫室内一圈。最后，他发现一扇壁橱的门露出些许缝隙，他想，如果自己将那门稍微开大些，亦断然不会为人察觉。于是他看了看门底，确信不会挂住什么，发出声音，然后小心翼翼地将门打开一点缝隙。

        17．如果他当时查看门顶而不是门底，情况或许要好些。因为壁橱门顶被一处木栓固定，栓后有处孔洞，洞里塞满许多细小铅沙粒。乔治试着将门轻轻打开点，再开一些，木栓终于从孔洞脱落，细小铅粒以难以想象的速度四下飞迸。壁橱下置一个锡盘，泻出的铅粒哗啦啦掉落到锡盘上，发出噼里啪啦的声响，乔治吓得血液似乎都凝固了。

        18．老人很快走进屋，询问究竟出了什么事。乔治脸色苍白，很快便被打道回府。

        19．下面轮到艾尔伯特·詹金斯登台亮相。已被淘汰的少年通过不同路径送出庄园，他们在那间屋子的不同经历当然无人知晓。

        20．桌上放着一只很小的圆箱，箱盖上嵌有螺帽，艾尔伯特仔细端详，那箱里肯定装有好奇的东西。他思忖如果不拧松螺帽，便不可能打开箱子。可他刚刚拧动螺帽，忽然箱里弹出一条蛇，一码来长的假蛇，啪地落到了他的胳膊上。他吓得连忙后退，大声尖叫起来。老人赶来抓住艾尔伯特的手肘，艾尔伯特僵直地站着，一只手抓着箱底，另只手抓着箱盖，那条假蛇掉在地上，一动不动。

        21．“得了，得了，”老人说道，“有时，家里有条蛇还是不错的，这样的话，还是快走为好！”说话间，老人即刻令人将艾尔伯特送走，容不得他半点解释。

        22. 接下来，威廉姆 · 史密斯走进房间，周围一旦没人，他马上开始东张西望，到处巡睃周围好玩的物件。威廉姆好奇心忒重，喜欢包打听，人还不够诚实。他留意到书柜抽屉上留下的钥匙，于是踮起脚尖走过去。钥匙上拴有一根金属线，线那头连接一台电机，那种电击可能让他终生难忘。威廉姆从电击中缓过神，刚能挪步，就被告知即刻回家，至于那些抽屉是否打开还是关闭，已与他全然无关。

        23．接下来的哈利·戈登也被单独留在屋里长达二十分钟，他没有离开座椅到处走动。哈利眼力不错，他与其他少年一样，但他更具有别人没有的诚实。盘盖也好，莓果也罢，或是抽屉把手，或是壁橱柜门，或是圆盒，或是钥匙，没有东西可以诱惑哈利。半小时后，哈利最终被留在榆树山庄。哈利忠心耿耿地为老人服务，为他养老送终。由于哈利为人正派，举止端庄，最终继承了老人大笔遗产。

WORK


        劳 动

        Eliza Cook (b. 1817, d. 1889) was born at London. In 1837 she commenced contributing to periodicals. In 1840 the first collection of her poems was made. In 1849 she became editor of “Eliza Cook’s Journal.”





        1. Work, work, my boy, be not afraid;

        Look labor boldly in the face;

        Take up the hammer or the spade,

         And blush not for your humble place.





        2. There’s glory in the shuttle’s song;

        There’s triumph in the anvil’s stroke;

        There’s merit in the brave and strong

        Who dig the mine or fell the oak.





        3. The wind disturbs the sleeping lake,

        And bids it ripple pure and fresh;

        It moves the green boughs till they make

        Grand music in their leafy mesh[62].





        4. And so the active breath of life

        Should stir our dull and sluggard wills;

        For are we not created rife[63]

        With health, that stagnant[64] torpor[65] kills?





        5. I doubt if he who lolls[66] his head

        Where idleness and plenty meet,

        Enjoys his pillow or his bread

        As those who earn the meals they eat.





        6. And man is never half so blest

        As when the busy day is spent



              So as to make his evening rest

        A holiday of glad content.

        1．干活，我的孩子，不要害怕；

        勇敢地，面对劳动；

        从容地拿起，锤子铁锨，

        千万不要，为卑微感到羞愧。





        2．穿梭机，歌唱中赋有荣光；

        铁砧敲打，寓意着凯旋胜利，

        勇敢坚强，涵盖人的优秀品德；

        阳光照耀，工人们坚实臂膀。





        3．微风，拂起沉睡的湖面，

        撩动，优美的水意潺潺；

        狂风，挪动绿意葱茏的枝干，

        茂密丛林，奏起交响奇观。





        4． 生命翕动，吐出力的欢畅，

        是否搅翻，沉寂的死水昏然？

        如果不愿，沦陷致命慵懒，

        哪怕身体康健，情欲正常？





        5． 是否，他还无力地歪着头，

        恣意放纵，将怠惰富足写在脸上，

        沉湎于，烟水繁华的食色享受，

        与艰难讨生活面孔，相得益彰。





        6．如果，铭记生活中点滴感恩，

        忙碌充足，度过愉快时光，

        节日礼花，绽放成光明降临，

        夜晚的心，最终皈依安康。





        LESSON 9





THE MANIAC


        疯 子

        1. A gentleman who had traveled in Europe, relates that he one day visited the hospital of Berlin, where he saw a man whose exterior[67] was very striking. His figure, tall and commanding, was bending with age, but more with sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on his temples were white almost as the driven snow, and the deepest melancholy was depicted[68] in his countenance.

        2. On inquiring who he was and what brought him there, he started, as, if from sleep, and, after looking around him, began with slow and measured steps to stride the hall, repeating in a low but audible voice, “Once one is two; once one is two.”

        3. Now and then he would stop, and remain with his arms folded on his breast as if in contemplation[69], for some minutes; then again resuming his walk, he continued to repeat, “Once one is two; once one is two.” His story, as our traveler understood it, is as follows:

        4. Conrad Lange, collector of the revenues[70] of the city of Berlin, had long been known as a man whom nothing could divert from the paths of honesty. Scrupulously[71] exact in an his dealings, and assiduous[72] in the discharge of all his duties, he had acquired the good will and esteem of all who knew him, and the confidence of the minister of finance[73], whose duty it is to inspect the accounts of all officers connected with the revenue.

        5. On casting up his accounts at the close of a particular year, he found a deficit[74] of ten thousand ducats[75]. Alarmed at this discovery, he went to the minister, presented his accounts, and informed him that he did not know how it had arisen, and that he had been robbed by some person bent on his ruin.

        6. The minister received his accounts, but thinking it a duty to secure a person who might probably be a defaulter[76],he caused him to be arrested, and put his accounts into the hands of one of his secretaries for inspection, who returned them the day after with the information that the deficiency arose from a miscalculation; that in multiplying, Mr. Lange had said, once one is two, instead of once one is one.



              7. The poor man was immediately released from confinement, his accounts returned, and the mistake pointed out. During his imprisonment, which lasted two days, he had neither eaten, drunk, nor taken any repose; and when he appeared, his countenance was as pale as death. On receiving his accounts, he was a long time silent; then suddenly awaking, as if from a trance, he repeated, “Once one is two.”

        8. He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situation; would neither eat nor drink, unless solicited; and took notice of nothing that passed around him. While repeating his accustomed phrase, if anyone corrected him by saying, “Once one is one,” his attention was arrested for a moment, and he said, “Ah, right, once one is one;” and then resuming his walk, he continued to repeat, “Once one is two.” He died shortly after the traveler left Berlin.

        9. This affecting story, whether true or untrue, obviously[77] abounds with lessons of instruction. Alas! how easily is the human mind thrown off its balance; especially when it is stayed on this world only, and has no experimental knowledge of the meaning of the injunction[78] of Scripture, to cast all our cares upon Him who careth for us, and who heareth even the young ravens when they cry.

        1．一位绅士曾去欧洲旅行，有一天，他去参观柏林一家医院。在医院里，他遇见一位男人，那人看上去令人吃惊。他身材高大，器宇轩昂，由于上了年纪，腰也弓了，脸上满是悲伤，鬓角残留些许灰白头发，像被碾压的路旁积雪，面孔上刻着深藏的忧郁。

        2．我询问他的身世，询问他如何这般模样。他仿佛从梦中醒来，环顾一下四周，开始缓慢却不失标准地在医院门厅前后踱步，嘴里还不停嘟哝，声音很小，但还算清晰：“一一得二，一一得二”。

        3．他时而停下，胳膊交叉胸前，似乎陷入一阵冥思祈祷，过了一会儿，又继续走动起来，嘴里依然重复：“一一得二，一一得二。”下面就是他的人生，留存在一个观光客记忆里的故事。

        4．康拉德·兰格曾是柏林市的税务官，多年来，他为人正派，极富声望。历年税务征收中，他总是力求一丝不苟的精确，勤勉地履行职责。熟捻他的人，无不对他赞誉有加。作为柏林市财政长官，负责稽查所有官员账户，厘清该市税收众多的资金往来，为他的职责所在。

        5．一个不同寻常的年末，康拉德清理完他的所有账目后，突然发现账面竟然出现一万元的亏空。他大为惊愕，面见部长后，他提交了自己的账务报告，并向部长陈述有人对他实施了抢劫，至于具体原因，尚一无所知，肯定有人想蓄意谋害他。



              6．部长接管了税务官账目，不过，他认为，这位税务官极可能涉嫌犯罪，应该即刻予以关押。在部长授意下，康拉德随后遭到逮捕。部长将康拉德的账目交与他的下属稽查，那位下属最终查明了亏空原因，原来，康拉德计算出现失误，他的乘法口诀背错了，正是故事开头他那句话，“一一得二，而不是一一得一”。

        7．倒霉的税务官很快从监狱里释放出来，他的账目亦已返还，他的错误自然得到纠正。前后两天关押期间，他不吃、不喝，甚至没打过一个盹。从监狱释放出来后，康拉德面如死灰。拿到他的账本后，突然间，他似乎从恍惚中苏醒过来，嘴里依然振振有词，“一一得二。”

        8．看来，可怜的税务官完全失去了自主意识，他还是不吃不喝，除非有人央求他。他对周围所有事情茫然无知，只是不停地念叨那句话。如果有人试图纠正他，告诉他“一一得一”，他留心片刻，随即改口说，“哦，不错，一一得一。”然后，又开始来回踱步，嘴里还是继续念叨，“一一得二。”那位旅游者离开柏林不久，康拉德，死了。

        9．这故事无论真假，让人唏嘘不已，故事蕴涵深刻，不乏指导意义。唉，尤其当今世道，人心如此容易失衡，完全不再具备《圣经》里警示训诫做人的基本常识。将人类所有忧虑不安寄予上帝，她对众生心怀悲悯；哪怕一只雏鸦嘶鸣哭泣，那万能的主亦能听见。

ROBIN REDBREAST


        知更鸟

        William Allingham (b. 1828, d. 1889) was born at Ballyshannon, Ireland. His father was a banker, and gave him a good education in Irish schools. He showed his literary tastes at an early date, contributing to periodicals, etc. In 1850 he published his first volume of poems; in 1854 his “Day and Night Songs” appeared, and in 1864 a poem in twelve chapters entitled “Lawrence Bloomfield in Ireland,” His reputation was established chiefly through his shorter lyrics, or ballad poetry. In 1864 he received a literary pension.

        1. Good-by, good-by to Summer!

        For Summer’s nearly done;

        The garden smiling faintly,

        Cool breezes in the sun;

        Our thrushes now are silent,

        Our swallows flown away,—

        But Robin’s here in coat of brown,

        And scarlet brestknot gay.

        Robin, Robin Redbreast,

        O Robin dear!

        Robin sings so sweetly

        In the falling of the year.





        2. Bright yellow, red, and orange,

        The leaves come down in hosts;

        The trees are Indian princes,

        But soon they’ll turn to ghosts;

        The leathery pears and apples

        Hang russet on the bough;

        It’s autumn, autumn, autumn late,

        ’T will soon be winter now.

        Robin, Robin Redbreast,

        O Robin dear!

        And what will this poor Robin do?

        For pinching days are near.





        3. The fireside for the cricket,

        The wheat stack for the mouse,



              When trembling night winds whistle

        And moan all round the house.

        The frosty ways like iron,

        The branches plumed with snow,—

        Alas! in winter dead and dark,

        Where can poor Robin go?

        Robin, Robin Redbreast,

        O Robin dear!

        And a crumb of bread for Robin,

        His little heart to cheer.





        Notes.—The Old World Robin here referred to is quite different in appearance and habits from the American Robin. It is only about half the size of the latter. Its prevailing color above is olive green, while the forehead, cheeks, throat, and breast are a light yellowish red. It does not migrate, but is found at all seasons throughout temperate Europe, Asia Minor, and northern Africa.

        1．再见，与夏季挥手作别，

        炎热的舞台，即将落幕，

        花园里，笑声黯淡下来，

        微风，吹过九月艳阳，

        画眉，不再引吭高歌，

        燕子， 亦成群结对飞远。

        知更鸟，身穿褐色衣裳，

        猩红色围脖，夺目耀眼，

        知更鸟，知更鸟，

        那么可爱，我的鸟儿。

        你婉转的歌声，清脆明亮，

        落在枝头，满眼夏日灿烂。





              2．明黄、艳红、亮橘斑斓，

        落叶纷飞里，光影迷乱，

        叙述昨天的树，繁复故事，

        寒风中，即将形销骨立，

        印度王子般，挺立依然。

        苹果树、梨树，外皮粗韧，

        赤褐色果实，点缀在夕阳苍峦，

        晚秋的步履，迟缓沉重，

        转眼间，迎来霁雪初寒。

        知更鸟，知更鸟，

        那么快乐，我的鸟儿。

        温暖的秋阳，风声中消失，

        你将如何，飞进浓密黑暗，

        最终躲过，萧瑟寒冬难关？





        3．蟋蟀，猫在壁炉过冬，

        老鼠，钻进麦堆取暖，

        颤栗的风，呼啸着刮过村庄，

        锐利疼痛，撕裂出呻吟呼喊。

        路上，泛着银色寒霜，

        大雪皑皑，铺开白色殿堂，

        冬天枝桠上，到处写满死亡。

        知更鸟，你究竟飞向何方？

        知更鸟，知更鸟，

        那么可爱， 我的鸟儿。

        为你，我撒上面包屑，

        你在枝头雀跃，报以欢欣。





        LESSON 11





THE FISH I DIDN’T CATCH


        脱钩的狗鱼

        John Greenleaf Whittier was born near Haverhill, Mass., in 1807, and died at Hampton Falls, N.H., in 1892. His boyhood was passed on a farm, and he never received a classical education. In 1829 he edited a newspaper in Boston. In the following year he removed to Hartford, Conn., to assume a similar position. In 1836 he edited an antislavery paper in Philadelphia. In 1840 he removed to Amesbury, Mass. Mr. Whittier’s parents were Friends, and he always held to the same faith. He wrote extensively both in prose and verse. As a poet, he ranked among those most highly esteemed and honored by his countrymen. “Snow Bound” is one of the longest and best of his poems.





        1. Our bachelor uncle who lived with us was a quiet, genial[79] man, much given to hunting and fishing; and it was one of the pleasures of our young life to accompany him on his expeditions to Great Hill, Brandy-brow Woods, the Pond, and, best of all, to the Country Brook. We were quite willing to work hard in the cornfield or the haying lot to finish the necessary day’s labor in season for an afternoon stroll through the woods and along the brookside.

        2. I remember my first fishing excursion as if it were but yesterday. I have been happy many times in my life, but never more intensely so than when I received that first fishing pole from my uncle’s hand, and trudged off with him through the woods and meadows. It was a still, sweet day of early summer; the long afternoon shadows of the trees lay cool across our path; the leaves seemed greener, the flowers brighter, the birds merrier, than ever before.

        3. My uncle, who knew by long experience where were the best haunts [80]of pickerel, considerately[81] placed me at the most favorable point. I threw out my line as I had so often seen others, and waited anxiously for a bite, moving the bait in rapid jerks on the surface of the water in imitation of the leap of a frog. Nothing came of it. “Try again,” said my uncle. Suddenly the bait sank out of sight. “Now for it,” thought I; “here is a fish at last.”

        4. I made a strong pull, and brought up a tangle of weeds. Again and again I cast out my line with aching arms, and drew it back empty. I looked at my uncle appealingly[82]. “Try once more,” he said; “we fishermen must have patience.”

        5. Suddenly something tugged at my line, and swept off with it into deep water. Jerking it up, I saw a fine pickerel wriggling in the sun. “Uncle!” I cried, looking back in uncontrollable excitement, “I’ve got a fish!” “Not yet,” said my uncle. As he spoke there was a plash in the water; I caught the arrowy gleam of a scared fish shooting into the middle of the stream, my hook hung empty from the line. I had lost my prize.





              6. We are apt to speak of the sorrows of childhood as trifles in comparison with



        those of grown-up people; but we may depend upon it the young folks don’t agree with us. Our griefs, modified[83] and restrained by reason, experience,and self-respect, keep the proprieties[84], and, if possible, avoid a scene; but the sorrow of childhood, unreasoning and all-absorbing[85], is a complete abandonment to the passion. The doll’s nose is broken, and the world breaks up with it; the marble rolls out of sight, and the solid globe rolls off with the marble.

        7. So, overcome with my great and bitter disappointment, I sat down on the nearest hassock[86], and for a time refused to be comforted, even by my uncle’s assurance that there were more fish in the brook. He refitted my bait, and, putting the pole again in my hands, told me to try my luck once more.

        8. “But remember, boy,” he said, with his shrewd smile, “never brag of catching a fish until he is on dry ground. I’ve seen older folks doing that in more ways than one, and so making fools of themselves. It’s no use to boast of anything until it’s done, nor then, either, for it speaks for itself.”



              9. How often since I have been reminded of the fish that I did not catch. When I hear people boasting of a work as yet undone, and trying to anticipate[87] the credit which belongs only to actual achievement[88], I call to mind that scene by the brookside, and the wise caution of my uncle in that particular instance takes the form of a proverb of universal application: “NEVER BRAG OF YOUR FISH BEFORE YOU CATCH HIM.”

        1807年，约翰 · 格林利夫 · 惠蒂尔出生于美国马萨诸塞州的哈福希尔附近地区，1892年在新罕布什尔州汉普敦大瀑布逝世。惠蒂尔在农场度过了童年时代，他从未接受过任何传统教育。1829年，惠蒂尔在波士顿开始编撰报纸，翌年搬迁到美国康涅狄格州首府哈特福特市继续编辑职业。1836年，他在费城从事反对奴隶制报刊编辑工作。1840年，他又迁回马萨诸塞州埃姆斯伯里。惠蒂尔父母为基督教公教会教友，他本人亦笃信基督教，一生写有大量散文与诗歌，堪称为美国最负声望及受人爱戴的诗人之一。《雪原》是他篇幅最长、最为优异的一篇诗歌作品。





        1．与我们全家共同生活的鳏夫叔叔沉默寡言，性情温和，打猎或垂钓占据他生活中大多时光，于是，跟随他到处郊游野足成了我们年少时乐此不疲的快乐生活。我们足迹遍及格瑞特山、布兰迪山坡森林和大湖等地方。令我们最为心驰神往的还是那条康瑞河。夏季来临，我们通常在玉米地或干草堆边挥汗如雨，筋疲力尽地做完当天必须完成的农活，午后，我们便钻进丛林，或者沿那条康瑞河尽兴散步。

        2．恍惚如昨天发生的一切，那是我首次出去钓鱼。在我一生中，有过许多快乐时光，可这次钓鱼，却给我留下刻骨铭心的记忆。平生第一次，我从叔叔手里接过那根鱼竿，随他穿过那簇簇丛林，涉过翻飞草场，一路跋涉步履艰难。记得当时正值初夏，四周安静极了，路边枝繁叶茂，遮蔽了午后漫长的阳光，满地蓊郁夹杂五颜六色的野花，鸟声鸣啾不断，天地间似乎未曾有过这样的美妙柔和。

        3．由于长期垂钓生涯，经验丰富的叔叔谙知狗鱼出没之地，他极为慎重地帮我选好上佳的垂钓地方。素日观看他人钓鱼颇多，我也学着别人模样，用力甩出长长的钓线，然后焦急地等待鱼儿上来咬钩；还不时模仿青蛙蹦跳姿势，沿水面上猛拽鱼饵，半晌，也没见一条鱼儿上钩。“再试一次，”叔叔对我叫道。突然，鱼钩沉下水面，“有了，”我心头一喜，“咬钩了。”



              4．我猛地提起鱼竿，拽出的却是缠成一团的水草。再来一次，我总是满怀希望地抛出钓线，却还是一无所获，胳膊亦隐约疼痛起来。我求救地看了看叔叔，“再试试，”他对我说，“钓鱼的人需要格外耐心。”

        5．忽然，什么东西扯住了鱼线，猛地往下一拽，我扯住鱼竿拉起一看，一条漂亮的狗鱼在阳光下挣扎扭动，“叔叔！”我回头大声叫道，抑制不住满心激动。“我钓到了一条大鱼！”“哎，”叔叔的话未说完，刹那间，水面溅起浪花，只见一道箭矢般银光划过，那条大鱼跃入水中，我手握的那柄钓竿上，只留下空空的饵钩，呜呼！到手的大狗鱼就这样在我的眼皮下溜走了。

        6.我们极易谈及孩提时代的懊恼，与成人那些痛苦比较，尽管鸡毛蒜皮，不值一提，但总会耿耿于怀。当然，年轻人看来每每不以为然。因理性、经验、甚至自尊改变并抑制的童年痛苦，将会演变成一种安之若素的面对，可能的话，我们或许不再百般纠结闷闷不乐。然而，孩提时代缺乏理性、沉湎痛苦难以自拔，却是任由性情恣意放纵。洋娃娃鼻子破了，整个世界随之打碎；弹子球滚不见了，整个天地接着地陷天塌。

        7.哎呀，一种说不出来的锥心痛苦攫取了我，我倍感失望，一屁股颓然瘫坐在身边的草墩上，叔叔好言好语的相劝亦无法使我平静下来。他一再劝说我，“河里的鱼，反正多着呢。”然后一声不吭地帮我重新安好鱼饵，将鱼竿递给我，嘱咐我再来试试手气。

        8.“孩子，请记住，”叔叔最后对我说，脸上露出狡黠笑意，“切忌不可自吹自擂，除非鱼儿上岸入笼。我这一生，见过多少年轻人花样翻新的吹牛，结果呢？徒给世人留下几多笑话。凡事八字未见一撇，不可吹嘘张扬。谨慎从事，低调做人，事实胜于雄辩。”

        9.从此，每当我一次次听到周围朋友吐沫四溅地吹嘘自己遥遥无期的奋斗目标，为人行事不切实际，却又指望成功唾手可得，那条漏网的大狗鱼总会不失时机地跳跃在我的面前，河边钓鱼的场景再度浮现。当年叔叔那么睿智冷静，循循善诱地开导我不可鲁莽，寡言者智，一条谚语教我悟透人生玄机：“静以修身，静水流深。”





        LESSON 12





IT SNOWS


        下雪了

        Sarah Josepha Hale (b. 1788, d.1879) was born in Newport, N.H. Her maiden name was Buell. In 1814 she married David Hale, an eminent lawyer, who died in 1822. Left with five children to support, she turned her attention to literature. In 1828 she became editor of the “Ladies’ Magazine.” In 1837 this periodical was united with “Godey’s Lady’s Book,” of which Mrs. Hale was literary editor for more than forty years.





        1. “It snows!” cries the Schoolboy, “Hurrah!” and his shout

         Is ringing through parlor and hall,

        While swift as the wing of a swallow, he’s out,

         And his playmates have answered his call;

        It makes the heart leap but to witness their joy;

         Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow[89],

        Like the rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy

         As he gathers his treasures of snow;

        Then lay not the trappings[90] of gold on thine heirs,

        While health and the riches of nature are theirs.





        2. “It snows!” sighs the Imbecile[91], “Ah!” and his breath

         Comes heavy, as clogged with a weight;

        While, from the pale aspect of nature in death,

         He turns to the blaze of his grate;

        And nearer and nearer, his soft-cushioned chair

         Is wheeled toward the life-giving flame;

        He dreads a chill puff of the snow-burdened air,

         Lest it wither his delicate frame;

        Oh! small is the pleasure existence can give,

        When the fear we shall die only proves that we live!

        3. “It snows!” cries the Traveler, “Ho!” and the word

         Has quickened his steed’s lagging pace;

        The wind rushes by, but its howl is unheard,

         Unfelt the sharp drift in his face;

        For bright through the tempest his own home appeared,



               Ay, though leagues intervened[92], he can see:

        There’s the clear, glowing hearth, and the table prepared,

         And his wife with her babes at her knee;

        Blest thought! how it lightens the grief-laden hour,

        That those we love dearest are safe from its power!





        4. “It snows!” cries the Belle, “Dear, how lucky!” and turns

         From her mirror to watch the flakes fall,

        Like the first rose of summer, her dimpled cheek burns!

         While musing[93] on sleigh ride and ball:

        There are visions of conquests[94], of splendor, and mirth,

         Floating over each drear winter’s day;

        But the tintings[95] of Hope, on this storm-beaten earth,

         Will melt like the snowflakes away.

        Turn, then thee to Heaven, fair maiden, for bliss;

        That world has a pure fount ne’er opened in this.





         5. “It snows!” cries the Widow, “O God!” and her sighs

         Have stifled[96] the voice of her prayer;

        Its burden ye’ll read in her tear-swollen eyes,

         On her cheek sunk with fasting and care.

        ’T is night, and her fatherless ask her for bread,

         But “He gives the young ravens their food,”

        And she trusts till her dark hearth adds horror to dread.,

         And she lays on her last chip of wood.

        Poor sufferer! that sorrow thy God only knows;

        ’T is a most bitter lot to be poor when it snows.

        1．“下雪了！”一位校园男生高声叫着，“太好啦！”伴随一声尖叫划过门厅，穿过走廊，他像只迅疾的燕子飞奔门外，同学们随即回应他的大呼小叫。不过目睹他们的快乐张扬，你的心在欢跳；窃以为，骄傲的财富绝不会给人带来欣喜，倾慕应该来自那些青春脉搏的活力四射。因为他们捧起来自圣父的雪花馈赠，并非显摆父母给予的财产继承，健康与天籁的得天独厚原本属于他们。



              2．“下雪了！”愚蠢的人在叹息，“唉呀！”他的呼吸变得如此滞重，似乎心有所雍；从死亡本质的惨白里，他不得不求助壁炉里烈火的熊熊温暖；那优裕的温柔乡愈来愈近，旋转着冲向赋以生命形式的骨骼，他害怕风中卷起的寒意彻骨，唯恐会摧毁他那孱弱不堪的肉体。噢，生存给予的快乐那么微不足道，人类无法逃脱死亡的恐惧仅仅证明，他，依然苟延残喘。

        3．“下雪了！”路途上行者发出感叹。“驾！”他策马加鞭，加快速度。风，在肆虐，但他难以听见风的尖利呼啸，只有刀子般扑面的疼痛；光，冲破风雪弥漫，他已看到前方；家，隐约在现。心灵相通的人儿，他能看见家里壁炉明净温暖，桌台已摆好，孩子们趴在妻子膝间玩耍，全家人都在焦急地等他。唯有蒙恩念想，才能减轻辛勤劳作的悲哀。我挚爱的亲人们呵，从主的祝福中获得安宁。

         4．“下雪了！”美女惊叹，“天呀，实在太美了！”她从镜中转身，窗外雪花飘落，宛若夏季第一朵玫瑰，她的脸上浮出笑意酒窝。恍惚中雪橇飞奔，还有豪华盛装舞会，红男绿女，欢歌浅笑，烟水繁华，柔情似水，打发那绵延不断的忧郁冬日。历尽风雨沧桑，希望之星黯淡，是否像那雪花融尽，倏忽不知所踪？不妨祈求上帝还有圣母赐予祝福！那才是未曾开启的醇美清泉。

        5．“下雪了！”寡妇哀叹，“哦，我的上帝！”她的叹息声声盖过了她的祷告。从她泪水浸泡的眼里，可以听见心在慢慢撕裂；她颧骨下陷，象征饥馑悲哀的呼号。在这个雪花飘落的冬夜，失去父亲的孩子向她伸手祈求面包。“万能的主，请哺食那些幼小寒鸦。”她仍然怀有希望，直到冰冷的壁炉落满恐惧，或者绝望，直到她将最后一片细柴投进炉腔。悲哀的母亲！唯独上帝才能洞悉你的苦难，雪花降临，那是穷人难以迈过的道道鬼门关。





        LESSON 13





RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH REWARDED


        尊重安息日

        1. In the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a barber who made a practice of following his ordinary occupation on the Lord’s day. As he was on the way to his morning’s employment, he happened to look into some place of worship just as the minister was giving out his text—“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” He listened long enough to be convinced that he was constantly breaking the laws of God and man by shaving and dressing his customers on the Lord’s day. He became uneasy, and went with a heavy heart to his Sabbath task.

        2. At length he took courage, and opened his mind to his minister, who advised him to give up Sabbath work, and worship God. He replied that beggary would be the consequence. He had a flourishing trade, but it would almost all be lost. At length, after many a sleepless night spent in weeping and praying, he was determined to cast all his care upon God, as the more he reflected, the more his duty became apparent[97].

        3. He discontinued his Sabbath work, went constantly and early to the public services of religion, and soon enjoyed that satisfaction of mind which is one of the rewards of doing our duty, and that peace which the world can neither give nor take away. The consequences he foresaw actually followed. His genteel[98] customers left him, and he was nicknamed “Puritan” or “Methodist.” He was obliged to give up his fashionable shop, and, in the course of years, became so reduced[99] as to take a cellar under the old market house and shave the poorer people.

        4. One Saturday evening, between light and dark, a stranger from one of the coaches, asking for a barber, was directed by the hostler to the cellar opposite. Coming in hastily, he requested to be shaved quickly, while they changed horses, as he did not like to violate[100] the Sabbath.This was touching the barber on a tender chord. He burst into tears; asked the stranger to lend him a half-penny to buy a candle, as it was not light enough to shave him with safety. He did so, revolving in his mind the extreme poverty to which the poor man must be reduced.

        5. When shaved, he said, “There must be something extraordinary in your history, which I have not now time to hear. Here is half a crown for you. When I return, I will call and investigate[101] your case. What is your name?” “William Reed,” said the astonished barber. “William Reed?” echoed the stranger: “William Reed? by your dialect[102] you are from the West.” “Yes, sir, from Kingston, near Taunton.” “William Reed from Kingston, near Taunton? What was your father’s name?” “Thomas.” “Had he any brother?” “Yes, sir, one, after whom I was named; but he went to the Indies, and, as we never heard from him, we supposed him to be dead.”



              6. “Come along, follow me,” said the stranger, “I am going to see a person who says his name is William Reed, of Kingston, near Taunton. Come and confront[103] him. If you prove to be indeed he who you say you are, I have glorious news for you. Your uncle is dead, and has left an immense fortune, which I will put you in possession of when all legal doubts are removed.”

        7. They went by the coach; saw the pretended William Reed, and proved him to be an impostor. The stranger, who was a pious attorney[104], was soon legally satisfied of the barber’s identity[105], and told him that he had advertised him in vain. Providence had now thrown him in his way in a most extraordinary manner, and he had great pleasure in transferring[106] a great many thousand pounds to a worthy man, the rightful heir of the property. Thus was man’s extremity[107] God’s opportunity[108]. Had the poor barber possessed one half-penny, or even had credit for a candle, he might have remained unknown for years; but he trusted God, who never said, “Seek ye my face,” in vain.

        1．前些年，巴斯城内有位理发匠，他一直保留星期日不休息、照常理发的习惯。一天，在他早晨去理发店的路上，他碰巧看见教徒做礼拜的一处地方，有位牧师正在分发布道经文，“别忘记安息日，请维护它的神圣”。他听了很久，终于相信自己所作所为确实违背了上帝与人类的法则，安息日里，他竟然还在为顾客打理胡须、修剪头发。想到这里，他心里变得纠结不安，反复琢磨安息日的道理。

        2．他终于鼓起勇气，向牧师袒露了他的忧虑。牧师建议他安息日向上帝祈祷，不要干活。他回答，如果不做生意的话，他就得到处去乞讨。他生意一向兴隆，周日不做活，他的生意可能会垮掉。经过不少辗转反侧的难眠之夜，不停地哭泣祷告，他最终决定全身心地信奉上帝，愈是反省，他愈感到他的职责至关重要。



        3．从此，每逢安息日，他不再干活，总是早起去参加公共宗教礼拜，不久，他便感到心灵的满足，这种满足来自履行宗教职责的馈赠，还有那份尘世既不能给予他、亦不能从其内心取走的安宁。他的预言很快得到应验，那些有教养的顾客不再光临他的理发店，他甚至还被封为“清教徒”、“卫道士”的绰号，被迫卖掉他那间时尚理发屋。随后岁月里，他生活日渐窘困，不得不租住在一家破旧市场地下室里，为穷人做点生意谋生。



              4．一个周六的晚上，天快擦黑了。一位从马车上下来的陌生人想要理发，原来，带客人来的人就是他理发店对面的马夫。匆忙走进小店后，客人一边将马缰递给马夫，一边催促理发匠尽快给他理发，他可不想破了安息日规矩。这句话，触动了理发匠心思，他不禁涕泗横流。原来屋里太黑，他唯恐做起活来不稳当，只有开口向客人先支借半便士买根蜡烛，客人照他的吩咐做了。理发匠贫困潦倒如此，让来客思忖良久。

        5．“你的经历肯定与众不同，”理发完毕后，客人说道：“我现在没有时间，先付你两个半便士，等会回来，我再找你好好聊聊。你叫什么名字？”“威廉 · 瑞德。”理发师告诉陌生人，心里有点吃惊。“威廉 · 瑞德？” 陌生人问道，“你的方言听起来，好像西边来的？”“不错，先生，我老家在陶顿旁边金斯敦。”“来自陶顿旁边金斯敦的威廉 · 瑞德，你父亲叫什么？”“托马斯。”“他有兄弟吗？”“有，先生，他有一个兄弟，在我洗礼后，他便去了西印度群岛，此后就再也没有音讯了，我们觉得他已经不在人世了。”

        6．“哎，先听我说，”陌生人说，“我正在找从金斯敦来的一个叫威廉 · 瑞德的人，不错，金斯敦确实离陶顿很近。倘若你能证实你所言不虚，我可有天大好事要告诉你。你的叔叔去世了，他留下一笔巨额遗产，你可以拥有这笔财产，当然你必须通过所有相关的法律认证。”

        7．两人坐马车赶回威廉 · 瑞德的家乡，见到了那个冒牌的威廉 · 瑞德，最后查明他是个骗子。原来，那位陌生人是位敬业的律师，他很快便获得了理发匠威廉 · 瑞德的合法身份证明，他还告诉理发匠自己曾登过广告寻找，最终一无所获。如今天遂人意，能将这份巨额财产交给值得拥有的人，一份财产的合法继承人，他感到非常高兴，这真是踏破铁鞋无觅处的天赐良机。倘若，当时那位贫困潦倒的理发匠手里还有半便士，如果不是一根蜡烛的诚信，或许接下来很多年，理发匠仍然默默无闻。他，相信上帝，而上帝将证明，“信任，永远不会徒劳。”

THE SANDS O’ DEE


        迪河沙滩

        Charles Kingsley (b.1819, d.1875) was born at Holne, Devonshire, England. He took his bachelor’s degree at Cambridge in 1842, and soon after entered the Church. His writings are quite voluminous, including sermons, lectures, novels, fairy tales, and poems, published in book form, besides numerous miscellaneous sermons and magazine articles. He was an earnest worker for bettering the condition of the working classes, and this object was the basis of most of his writings. As a lyric poet he has gained a high place. The “Saint’s Tragedy” and “Andromeda” are the most pretentious of his poems, and “Alton Locke” and “Hypatia” are his best known novels.





        1. “O Mary, go and call the cattle home,

         And call the cattle home,

         And call the cattle home,

         Across the sands o’ Dee!” [109]



        The western wind was wild and dank with foam,

         And all alone went she.





        2. The creeping tide came up along the sand,

         And o’er and o’er the sand,

         And round and round the sand,

         As far as eye could see;

        The blinding mist came down and hid the land—

         And never home came she.





        3. Oh, is it weed, or fish, or floating hair?—

         A tress o’ golden hair,

         O’ drowned maiden’s hair,

         Above the nets at sea.

        Was never salmon yet that shone so fair

         Among the stakes on Dee.





        4. They rowed her in across the rolling foam,

         The cruel, crawling foam,

         The cruel, hungry foam,

         To her grave beside the sea;

        But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home,

         Across the sands O’ Dee.

        1．“哦，玛丽，去牛舍看看，

        去牛舍，唤唤牛儿，

        去那里，看看牛儿可在。”

        于是，她穿过迪河沙滩，

        寒风肆虐，浪花翻卷，

        她竟然，独自前往。





        2．潮水蠕动着，漫过沙滩，

        哗啦啦，一浪高过一浪，

        就那样，周而复始，

        远远望去，极目穷尽。

        浓密的雾霭，笼罩大地，

        她竟然，再也没有回来。





        3．哦，那是野草、鱼儿、丝带？

        或者，树的金色枝条？

        或者，闪烁迷人的鲑鱼，

        盘桓在，险恶的滩涂？

        天呀，那是溺水少女的头发，

        缠绕在，近海渔网的旁边；





        4．越过海浪，渔民的小船划近，

        波涛翻涌中，艰难穿行，

        嗜血的魔鬼，扑打过来，

        残忍地，将她无情吞没，

        依然听见，玛丽凄厉地呼喊，

        久久回荡，在迪河的沙滩。

SELECT PARAGRAPHS


        《圣经》节选

        1. O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him; sing psalms unto him; talk ye of all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Remember his marvelous[110] works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.

        2. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained[111]; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion[112] over the work of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

        3. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God; in him will I trust. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.

        4. O come, let us sing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and show ourselves glad in him with psalms. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; let the whole earth stand in awe of him. For he cometh, for he cometh, to judge the earth; and with righteousness to judge the world, and the people with his truth.

        5. Oh that men would praise the Lord’ for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven; they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble; they reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven[113]. Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!



              6. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

        —Bible.

        1．哦，感谢尊贵的耶和华，呼唤它的名字；让其恩泽在世间流传；为你歌唱，为你呈献美好诗篇；传播你的奇妙功绩；赞叹你的神圣荣光；让信奉神的万民欣喜若狂；铭记你无所不能的作为；你摧枯拉朽的奇迹，以及金口烁言的判断。

        2．哦，耶和华，万民的上帝。你的圣名在世界每一个角落传诵。谁将你至高无上的荣光撒满天穹；抬头瞭望夜空，你遣命月转星移；那里留下你神迹的伟大。人是什么？你警觉着人的贪欲；你是否眷顾人的儿子圣子？你让他与天使般圣洁，你将荣誉与光耀的皇冠赐予他。你令他担当你的职责，让他具有俯瞰众生的从容和力量。哦，耶和华，万民的上帝。你的圣名在世界每一个角落传诵。

        3．我会谈论耶和华的神圣，你是我心灵的庇护和堡垒，我信任尊贵的上帝。因为，你将你的爱施加于我，我要传诵你的神圣，并永远景仰。你洞悉我的名字，并呼唤我，我要回应你的呼唤；与你一起度过艰难时世；我要传诵你的神圣，并景仰你。我将终生让你欢欣，向你袒露我灵魂的皈依。

        5．哦，人们将讴歌耶和华的美德，讴歌你怜惜幼弱生命的温柔与悲悯！孩子们划着小船奔向大海，他们在经济大潮中不断沉浮，他们亲眼目睹耶和华的万能，你的超然力量。你翻云覆雨的手，才能搅起漫天的暴雨狂飙。孩子们在扭曲翻滚，倏忽升到半空，倏忽坠落沟壑，他们的灵魂得以熔炼。他们眩晕混沌奔波不止，他们步履蹒跚不明方向，仿佛站在世界尽头的悬崖边上。他们向耶和华哭诉苦难，你引导他们走出绝望。你使风暴平息，波涛不再涌翻，万籁俱静。暴风雨停息了，孩子们在欢笑，上帝照亮了他们梦中的天堂。哦，人们将赞叹上帝的慈善，你运筹帷幄以拯救迷途的羔羊。



              6．耶和华啊，你是我的牧羊人，须臾不能缺少。你吩咐我卧躺在绿色的牧场上；你指引我走向静穆的溪流，你让我的灵魂得以复苏；为了你的名誉，你带着我走向公平正义的道路。诚然，我走在死亡阴影笼罩下的山谷，但我决不惧怕魔鬼，因为上帝之光与我同在，还有你的威严和信仰，给我安慰。耶和华神，你在我的面前铺好台桌，我的敌人与我对视相望。你将圣油涂抹摩挲在我的头顶，圣杯悄然漫溢。是的，良知和怜悯将伴我走过一生；我将在你的宫殿生活，直到永远。

THE CORN SONG


        玉米谣

        1. Heap high the farmer’s wintry hoard![114]



        Heap high the golden corn!

        No richer gift has Autumn poured

        From out her lavish[115] horn!





        2. Let other lands, exulting, glean

        The apple from the pine,

        The orange from its glossy green,

        The cluster from the vine;





        3. We better love the hardy gift

        Our rugged vales bestow,

        To cheer us, when the storm shall drift

        Our harvest fields with snow.





        4. Through vales of grass and meads[116] of flowers

        Our plows their furrows made,

        While on the hills the sun and showers

        Of changeful April played.





        5. We dropped the seed o’er hill and plain,

        Beneath the sun of May,

        And frightened from our sprouting grain

        The robber crows away.





        6. All through the long, bright days of June,

        Its leaves grew green and fair,

        And waved in hot midsummer’s noon

        Its soft and yellow hair.

        7. And now, with Autumn’s moonlit eves,

        Its harvest time has come;

        We pluck away the frosted leaves

        And bear the treasure home.



              8. There, richer than the fabled gift

        Apollo [117]showered of old,

        Fair hands the broken grain shall sift,

        And knead its meal of gold.





        9. Let vapid[118] idlers loll in silk,

        Around their costly board;

        Give us the bowl of samp[119] and milk,

        By homespun beauty poured!





        10. Where’er the wide old kitchen hearth

        Sends up its smoky curls,

        Who will not thank the kindly earth

        And bless our farmer girls!





        11. Then shame on all the proud and vain,

        Whose folly laughs to scorn

        The blessing of our hardy grain,

        Our wealth of golden corn!





        12. Let earth withhold her goodly root;

        Let mildew blight the rye,

        Give to the worm the orchard’s fruit,

        The wheat field to the fly:





        13. But let the good old crop adorn

        The hills our fathers trod;

        Still let us, for his golden corn,

        Send up our thanks to God!





        From Whittier’s “Songs of Labor”

        阿波罗，带来光的神奇，

        揉捻成，霞光万道的晚餐。





              9．乏味无趣，那些慵懒之辈，

        衣着华美，佳肴云集，

        应当施舍，给穷人一碗米粥，

        古道热肠的质朴，让人流泪。





        10．何处寻找，古老宽敞的灶台？

        雾霭散去，袅袅炊烟飘来，

        难道不再祝福，仁慈大地，

        胼手砥足，我们农家女孩？





        11．骄傲虚妄，实在极端可耻，

        谁竟然，卖弄愚昧自夸，

        尽情嘲笑，农夫的辛勤劳作，

        还有黄澄澄的，地里庄稼！





        12．让大地留存，优异的良种，

        否则，霉菌病让黑麦绝收，

        蝇虫，在果园里肆虐成群，

        万亩良田，全被飞鸟糟蹋。





        13．亘古流传的种子，装扮自然，

        祖先土地，广袤的田野山峦，

        怀念上帝，点播下金色玉米，

        心存感激，至今口授相传。

        LESSON 17





THE VENOMOUS WORM


        致命的虫豸

        John Russell (b. 1793, d. 1863) graduated at Middlebury College, Vt., in 1818. He was at one time editor of the “Backwoodsman,” published at Grafton, Ill., and later of the “Louisville Advocate.” He was the author of many tales of western adventure and of numerous essays, sketches, etc. His language is clear, chaste, and classical; his style concise, vigorous, and sometimes highly ornate.





        1. Who has not heard of the rattlesnake or copperhead? An unexpected sight of either of these reptiles[120] will make even the lords of creation recoil[121]; but there is a species of worm, found in various parts of this country, which conveys a poison of a nature so deadly that, compared with it, even the venom of the rattlesnake is harmless. To guard our readers against this foe of human kind is the object of this lesson.

        2. This worm varies much in size. It is frequently an inch in diameter, but, as it is rarely seen except when coiled, its length can hardly be conjectured. It is of a dull lead color, and generally lives near a spring or small stream of water, and bites the unfortunate people who are in the habit of going there to drink. The brute creation it never molests. They avoid it with the same instinct that teaches the animals of India to shun the deadly cobra.[122]

        3. Several of these reptiles have long infested[123] our settlements, to the misery and destruction of many of our fellow citizens. I have, therefore, had frequent opportunities of being the melancholy spectator of the effects produced by the subtile[124] poison which this worm infuses[125].

        4. The symptoms of its bite are terrible. The eyes of the patient become red and fiery, his tongue swells to an immoderate size, and obstructs[126] his utterance; and delirium[127] of the most horrid character quickly follows. Sometimes, in his madness, he attempts the destruction of his nearest friends.

        5. If the sufferer has a family, his weeping wife and helpless infants are not unfrequently the objects of his frantic fury. In a word, he exhibits, to the life, all the detestable passions that rankle[128] in the bosom of a savage; and such is the spell in which his senses are locked, that no sooner has the unhappy patient recovered from the paroxysm[129] of insanity occasioned by the bite, than he seeks out the destroyer for the sole purpose of being bitten again.



              6. I have seen a good old father, his locks as white as snow, his step slow and trembling, beg in vain of his only son to quit the lurking place of the worm. My heart bled when he turned away; for I knew the fond hope that his son would be the “staff of his declining years,” had supported him through many a sorrow.

        7. Youths of America, would you know the name of this reptile? It is called the WORM[130] OF THE STILL[131].


【中文阅读】

        约翰 · 拉塞尔（1793～1863），1818年毕业于美国佛蒙特州米德尔伯里学院。一度曾任伊利诺斯州格拉夫顿《蛮荒人》编辑，后为《路易斯维尔宣传者》编辑。他写过许多西部冒险小说，以及大量的散文随笔等等。他的语言清晰质朴，遣词造句传统典雅，文风简洁热情，有时过于文辞华丽。





        1．有人从没听说响尾蛇或一种头呈铜色的北美毒蛇？这两种虫豸，无论哪一种与你不期而遇，哪怕作为生物界主宰的人类亦会惊恐万分；不过，还有一种极为特异的蠕虫，这种蠕虫在美国不少地区业已相继发现，这种蠕虫分泌出某种致命的天然毒液，与其相比，响尾蛇对人的伤害委实是小巫见大巫。本文旨在指导读者如何预防来自人类敌人的伤害。

        2．这种蠕虫体形差异很大。通常其直径达到一英寸，但除非蠕虫盘绕成团，这种情形极为鲜见，因此蠕虫长度几乎难以估测。蠕虫呈暗铅色，通常盘踞在泉水或细小溪流附近，对前去饮水的人发动攻击。蠕虫从不攻击猛兽，与此同时，那些北美猛兽出于相同本能亦尽量避免与蠕虫接触，甚至知道如何避开致命的眼镜蛇。

        3．世界上存在好几种长期侵扰人类的爬行虫豸，它们给人们生命酿成不幸或导致灾难。这种蠕虫刺入人体哪怕极少或微量体液，亦会给人带来不可避免的悲剧。不幸的是，这类受害者对我来说，实在是司空见惯。

        4．遭受这种蠕虫叮咬的症状相当可怕。病人眼睛变红或炙热，舌头过度肿胀，发音模糊不清，随后出现可怕的谵妄症状，病人处于癫狂状态下，甚至有可能攻击周围亲朋好友。

        5．如果受害人有家小的话，他身边哭泣的妻子以及无助的孩子们不可避免地成为他狂暴状态下首选攻击的目标，这一惨绝人寰悲剧并非少见。 简而言之，受害人会向外界表达他野蛮内心的可怕暴怒，这种行为归咎于意识锁闭，即倘若由蠕虫咬噬引起精神错乱间断发作，这类病人一旦苏醒过来，他即刻会寻找下一个报复者，唯一目的在于，他希望再度遭受虫豸啮噬。



              6．我曾经见过一位心地仁慈的年迈父亲，他的鬓发几乎花白，他的步履蹒跚颤抖，却依然徒劳无助地为他唯一的儿子乞讨，希望儿子可以从这类蠕虫潜伏期症状中获得解脱。当他艰难地转身离开时，我的心在滴血，因为，我知道这美好的企盼，无外乎为他走过垂暮之年的唯一精神支柱，并已支撑他度过许多艰难厄苦。

         7．美国年轻人们，你知道这种爬行动物叫什么？它就是僵尸蠕虫。





        LESSON 18





THE FESTAL BOARD


        节日聚会

        1. Come to the festal[132] board tonight,

        For bright-eyed beauty will be there,

        Her coral lips in nectar steeped,

        And garlanded[133] her hair.





        2. Come to the festal board to-night,

        For there the joyous laugh of youth

        Will ring those silvery peals, which speak

        Of bosom pure and stainless truth.





        3. Come to the festal board to-night,

        For friendship, there, with stronger chain,

        Devoted[134] hearts already bound

        For good or ill, will bind again.

         I went.





        4. Nature and art their stores outpoured;

        Joy beamed in every kindling glance;

        Love, friendship, youth, and beauty smiled;

        What could that evening’s bliss enhance[135]?

         We parted.





        5. And years have flown; but where are now

        The guests who round that table met?

        Rises their sun as gloriously

        As on the banquet’s eve it set?





        6. How holds the chain which friendship wove?

        It broke; and soon the hearts it bound

        Were widely sundered[136]; and for peace,

        Envy and strife and blood were found.



              7. The merriest laugh which then was heard

        Has changed its tones to maniac screams,

        As half-quenched memory kindles up

        Glimmerings[137] of guilt in feverish dreams.

        8. And where is she whose diamond eyes

        Golconda’s [138]purest gems outshone?

        Whose roseate[139] lips of Eden breathed?

        Say, where is she, the beauteous one?





        9. Beneath yon willow’s drooping shade,

        With eyes now dim, and lips all pale,

        She sleeps in peace. Read on her urn,

        “A broken heart.” This tells her tale.





        10. And where is he, that tower of strength,

        Whose fate with hers for life was joined?

        How beats his heart, once honor’s throne?

        How high has soared his daring mind?





        11. Go to the dungeon’s gloom to-night;

        His wasted form, his aching head,

        And all that now remains of him,

        Lies, shuddering, on a felon’s[140] bed.





        12. Ask you of all these woes the cause?

        The festal board, the enticing[141] bowl,

        More often came, and reason fled,

        And maddened passions spurned[142] control.

        13. Learn wisdom, then. The frequent feast

        Avoid; for there, with stealthy tread

        Temptation walks, to lure[143] you on,

        Till death, at last, the banquet spread.





        14. And shun, oh shun, the enchanted [144]cup!

        Though now its draught like joy appears,

        Ere long it will be fanned by sighs,

        And sadly mixed with blood and tears.

        分道扬镳，畅怀交流不再，

         改弦易张， 恍然回眸拥抱，

        沉寂的内心，再次照亮，

        疯狂梦幻 ， 心灵深处罪孽。



              8．明眸生辉，那双迷人的眼睛，

        胜过世上，昂贵的钻石，

        芳唇轻启，玫瑰色诱人，

        消失何方？美丽从此不再。





        9．远方垂柳，撒下鬼魅阴影，

        眼神黯淡，沧桑已经老去，

        她亦安然睡下，墓志铭上写着：

        “破碎的心”，芳菲纷纷落尽。





        10．如今，他已抵达权力顶端，

        当初，她的命运与谁相连？

        他备受摧残，贪婪向往名利，

        他野心勃勃，梦寐平步登天。





         11．今晚，他将走进阴暗地牢，

        行尸走肉的躯体，头痛欲裂，

        孑然一身，感叹行只影单，

        不寒而栗，重温难醒的梦魇。





        12．倘若质疑，你所有的悲哀，

        不过归咎，聚会上的酒杯，

        时光买醉，毫无理由的失控，

        走火入魔，理智深陷昏睡。





         13. 究竟如何，更加睿智冷静，

        摒弃世俗，走马灯的诱惑，

        豪华盛筵， 夜夜笙歌不断，

        魑魅魍魉，早牵你进坟墓。





        14．躲开吧， 那施加魔咒的酒盅，

        杯空酒尽， 叹息人生无常，

        往日愧疚， 忘乎所以的虚妄，

        蓦然回首，难叙一把苍凉。

HOW TO TELL BAD NEWS


        如何告诉噩耗

        Mr. H. and the Steward.

        Mr. H. Ha! Steward, how are you, my old boy? How do things go on at home?

        Steward. Bad enough, your honor; the magpie’s dead.

        H. Poor Mag! So he’s gone. How came he to die?

        S. Overeat himself, sir.

        H. Did he? A greedy dog; why, what did he get he liked so well?

        S. Horseflesh, sir; he died of eating horseflesh,

        H. How came he to get so much horseflesh?

        S. All your father’s horses, sir.

        H. What! are they dead, too?

        S. Ay, sir; they died of overwork.

        H. And why were they overworked, pray?

        S. To carry water, sir.

        H. To carry water! and what were they carrying water for?

        S. Sure, sir, to put out the fire.

        H. Fire! what fire?

        S. O, sir, your father’s house is burned to the ground.

        H. My father’s house burned down! and how came it set on fire?

        S. I think, sir, it must have been the torches.

        H. Torches! what torches?

        S. At your mother’s funeral.

        H. My mother dead!

        S. Ah, poor lady! she never looked up, after it.

        H. After what?

        S. The loss of your father.

        H. My father gone, too?

        S. Yes, poor gentleman! he took to his bed as soon as he heard of it.

        H. Heard of what?

        S. The bad news, sir, and please your honor.

        H. What! more miseries! more bad news!

        S. Yes, sir; your bank has failed, and your credit is lost, and you are not worth a shilling in the world. I made bold, sir, to wait on you about it, for I thought you would like to hear the news.

        H先生和管家

        H先生：你好！管家，最近好吗？老伙计。家里都还好吗？

        管家： 实在太糟了，尊贵的主人，家里那只叫喜鹊的狗儿死了。

        H先生：可怜的狗儿，它竟然死了，怎么死的？

        管家： 它吃多了，先生。

        H先生：是吗？这条贪吃的狗。究竟怎么回事？它到底吃了什么？

        管家： 马肉，先生。它吃了太多的马肉。

        H先生：它怎么能吃这么多马肉？

        管家： 你父亲的马一只也没剩下，先生。

        H先生：怎么回事？父亲的马怎么死光了呢？

        管家： 唉！先生，那些马是干活累死的。

        H先生：它们为什么干那么多活？快说呀！

        管家： 它们要运水，先生。

        管家： 没错，先生，家里失火了。

        H先生：失火？怎么回事？

        管家： 哦，先生，你父亲的房子烧光了。

        H先生：我父亲的房子烧光了！房子怎么会失火呢？

        管家： 我觉得，先生，应该是那些火把引起了火灾。

        H先生：火把？什么火把？

        管家： 你母亲葬礼上的火把。

        H先生：啊？我母亲去世了？

        管家：他听到了噩耗，先生，尊敬的主人。

        H先生：我的天呀！还有噩耗？？究竟有完没完的噩耗？

        管家：听好，先生。你的银行破产了，你的信用没有了，在这个世界上，如今，你不值一个子了。先生，我如此冒昧地等你回来，就是要告诉你这些事情，我原以为，你会乐意听到这些噩耗的。





        LESSON 20





THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM


        布伦海姆战役

        Robert Southey (b. 1774, d. 1843) was born in Bristol, England. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1793. In 1804 he established himself permanently at Greta Hall, near Keswick, Cumberland, in the “Lake Country,” where he enjoyed the friendship and society of Wordsworth and Coleridge, other poets of the “Lake School.” He was appointed poet laureate in 1813, and received a pension of ￡300 a year from the government in 1835. Mr. Southey was a voluminous writer in both prose and verse. As a poet, he can not be placed in the first rank, although some of his minor poems are very happy in thought and expression. Among his most noted poetical works are “Joan of Arc,” “Thalaba the Destroyer,” “Madoc,” “Roderick,” and the “Curse of Kehama.”





        1. It was a summer evening,

        Old Kaspar’s work was done,

        And he, before his cottage door,

        Was sitting in the sun;

        And by him sported on the green,

        His little grandchild Wilhelmine.





        2. She saw her brother Peterkin

        Roll something large and round,

        Which he beside the rivulet,

        In playing there, had found;

        He came to ask what he had found,

        That was so large, and smooth, and round.





        3. Old Kaspar took it from the boy,

        Who stood expectant by;

        And then the old man shook his head,

        And, with a natural sigh,

        “ ’T is some poor fellow’s skull,” said he,

        “Who fell in the great victory.





        4. “I find them in the garden,

        For there’s many hereabout;

        And often when I go to plow,

        The plowshare turns them out;

        For many thousand men,” said he,

        “Were slain in that great victory.”





        5. “Now tell us what ’t was all about,”

        Young Peterkin he cries;

        While little Wilhelmine looks up

        With wonder-waiting eyes;

        “Now tell us all about the war,

        And what they killed each other for.”





        6. “It was the English,” Kaspar cried,

        “Who put the French to rout,

        But what they killed each other for,

        I could not well make out;

        But everybody said,” quoth he,

        “That ’t was a famous victory:





        7. “My father lived at Blenheim then,

        Yon little stream, hard by;

        They burnt his dwelling to the ground,

        And he was forced to fly;

        So, with his wife and child he fled,

        Nor had he where to rest his head.





        8. “With fire and sword, the country round

        Was wasted, far and wide;

        And many a nursing mother then,

        And newborn baby died;

        But things like that, you know, must be

        At every famous victory.





        9. “They say it was a shocking sight

        After the field was won;

        For many thousand bodies here

        Lay rotting in the sun:

        But things like that, you know, must be

        After a famous victory.





        10. “Great praise the Duke of Marlboro’ won,

        And our young prince, Eugene.”

        “Why, ’t was a very wicked thing!”

        Said little Wilhelmine.

        “Nay, nay, my little girl!” quoth he,

        “It was a famous victory.

        11. “And everybody praised the Duke

        Who this great fight did win.”

        “But what good came of it at last?”

        Quoth little Peterkin.



              “Why, that I can not tell,” said he,

        “But ’t was a glorious victory.”





        Notes.—The Battle of Blenheim, in the “War of the Spanish Succession,” was fought August 13, 1704, near Blenheim, in Bavaria, between the French and Bavarians, on one Ride, and an allied army under the great English general, the Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene, Prince of Savoy, on the other. The latter won a decisive victory: 10,000 of the defeated army were killed and wounded, and 13,000 were taken prisoners.

        LESSON 21





“I PITY THEM”


        “我怜悯他们”

        1. A poor man once undertook to emigrate[145] from Castine, Me., to Illinois. When he was attempting to cross a river in New York, his horse broke through the rotten timbers of the bridge, and was drowned. He had but this one animal to convey all his property and his family to his new home.

        2. His wife and children were almost miraculously[146] saved from sharing the fate of the horse; but the loss of this poor animal was enough. By its aid the family, it may be said, had lived and moved; now they were left helpless in a land of strangers, without the ability[147] to go on or return, without money or a single friend to whom to appeal. The case was a hard one.





              3. There were a great many who “passed by on the other side.” Some even laughed at the predicament[148] in which the man was placed; but by degrees a group of people began to collect, all of whom pitied him.

        4. Some pitied him a great deal, and some did not pity him very much, because, they said, he might have known better than to try to cross an unsafe bridge, and should have made his horse swim the river. Pity, however, seemed rather to predominate[149]. Some pitied the man, and some the horse; all pitied the poor, sick mother and her six helpless children.

        5. Among this pitying party was a rough son of the West, who knew what it was to migrate some hundreds of miles over new roads to locate[150] a destitute[151] family on a prairie. Seeing the man’s forlorn situation, and looking around on the bystanders, he said, “All of you seem to pity these poor people very much, but I would beg leave to ask each of you how much.”

        6. “There, stranger,” continued he, holding up a ten dollar bill, “there is the amount of my pity; and if others will do as I do, you may soon get another pony. God bless you.” It is needless to state the effect that this active charity produced. In a short time the happy emigrant arrived at his destination[152], and he is now a thriving[153] farmer, and a neighbor to him who was his “friend in need, and a friend indeed.”

        1.从前，一位穷人率全家老小从缅因州卡斯廷准备移居到伊利诺斯州。在纽约州过河时，他家里的马撞断桥上已经朽烂的栅栏，不幸掉到河里淹死了。那淹死的马是全家唯一的运输工具，是驮运他家所有家产搬迁到新家的所有指望。

        2.很难相信，这家穷人的妻小最终从丢失马匹的绝望深渊中恢复过来，不过，马的损失本身够大。或许可以这么说，无论居住或者搬迁，马对这个处于迁徙状态中的家来说，毕竟举足轻重。如今，全家人在这块举目无亲的土地上求告无门，缺少盘缠无人可以求助。他们甚至没有办法决定是否继续前行，还是原路返回。当时境况的确非常糟糕。

        3.那时，还有大批移民逆向涌来，甚至有人嘲笑这家穷人手足无措的窘困。不过，慢慢地，有的人开始为这家人募捐，大家都很怜悯这不幸的一家人。

        4.有些人深深同情这一家庭，有些人却不以为然，他们觉得这家人早该清楚，不该从那条不安全的桥上过，或是让那匹马游过河。大家众说纷纭，七嘴八舌，最后，来往的移民队伍里还是怜悯同情占了上风。有的人同情那家人，有的人叹息那马；不过，那位贫穷体弱的母亲，以及她六个无助的孩子无不让人潸然泪下。



              5.人群中有位当地西部酋长的儿子，性格相当直率。他清楚在荒无人烟的大草原上跋涉数百英里，对两手空空的一家老小来说，意味着什么。目睹这家人的绝望无助，看到四周围观的人群，他高声说道：“看来，你们都非常同情这家遭难的人，我是否可以冒昧地问一下，你们每人能拿出多少钱？”

        6.“我们原本素昧平生，”他接着往下说，同时举起手里一张10美元的钞票，“这是我捐出的钱，如果有人像我一样，同样捐出10元钱的话，我马上送你一匹小马驹，上帝保佑你们！”不用说，当时募捐场面相当火暴，因为，那些迁入的新移民很快在当地定居落户；酋长儿子的农场昌盛兴旺，有幸作为他的邻居，大家如何不乐意结交这种可谓“患难之交见真情”的新朋挚友呢。

AN ELEGY ON MADAM BLAIZE


        布莱兹夫人的挽歌

        Oliver Goldsmith (b. 1728, d. 1774) was born at Pallas, or Pallasmore, in the parish of Forney, Ireland. He received his education at several schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at Leyden. He spent some time in wandering over continental Europe, often in poverty and want. In 1756 he became a resident of London, where he made the acquaintance of several celebrated men, among whom were Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His writings are noted for their purity, grace, and fluency. His fame as a poet is secured by “The Traveler,” and “The Deserted Village;” as a dramatist, by “She Stoops to Conquer;” and as a novelist, by “The Vicar of Wakefield.” His reckless extravagance always kept him in financial difficulty, and he died heavily in debt. His monument is in Westminster Abbey.





        1. Good people all, with one accord[154],

        Lament for Madam Blaize,

        Who never wanted a good word—

        From those who spoke her praise.





        2. The needy seldom passed her door,

        And always found her kind;

        She freely lent to all the poor—

        Who left a pledge[155] behind.





        3. She strove the neighborhood to please,

        With manner wondrous winning:

        She never followed wicked ways—

        Unless when she was sinning.





        4. At church, in silks and satin new,

        With hoop of monstrous size,

        She never slumbered in her pew—

        But when she shut her eyes.





        5. Her love was sought, I do aver,

        By twenty beaux and more;

        The king himself has followed her—

        When she has walked before.





        6. But now, her wealth and finery fled,

        Her hangers[156]-on cut short all,

        Her doctors found, when she was dead—

        Her last disorder mortal[157].





        7. Let us lament, in sorrow sore;

        For Kent Street well may say,

        That, had she lived a twelvemonth more—

        She had not died to-day.

        奥利弗 · 戈德史密斯（1728～1774）出生于爱尔兰帕拉斯，又称福尼教区帕拉斯茅。他在都柏林三圣学院、爱丁堡大学以及莱顿大学数处接受教育。在极端窘困的条件下，他曾游历整个欧洲大陆。1756年，戈德史密斯在伦敦定居，他结识了数位有名望的权威学者，包括约翰逊博士以及约书亚 · 雷诺先生。戈氏的作品纯净优雅，行文流畅。他兼诗人、剧作家和小说家于一身，其著名作品包括：诗歌《行旅者》和《被遗弃的村庄》，剧作《她向征服者臣服》，小说《韦克菲尔德教区牧师》。戈德史密斯挥金如土的生活让自己时常捉襟见肘，甚至死后亦留有大量债务。威斯敏斯特大教堂矗有他的纪念碑。





        1．善良的人，异口同声，

        哀悼，布莱兹夫人，

        生前，她不在意任何褒奖，

        尽管，他们发自内心称赞。





        2．穷人，很少从她的门前走过，

        她心地善良，济贫扶弱，

        她施舍众生，为人慷慨，

        借贷者，甚至只留下极少许诺。





        3．她竭尽所能，造福乡梓，

        心有谋略，变通灵活，

        她为人坦荡，不耍诡计，

        除非，偶尔难以顾及。





        4．教堂里，那些豪绅贵妇，

        绫罗绸缎，裙裾飘飞，

        她闭上眼睛，聆听诵经，

        却从不曾经，打盹走神。



        5．她追求者甚众，我敢断定，

        那些人百般追求，倾心思慕，

        她娉婷袅娜，走在街上，

        即便国王，亦趋尊随后。





        6．如今，她财富散尽美貌不再，

        那些追随者，日渐稀疏，

        待最后离世，医生才发现，

        她身体衰竭，难以挽救。





        7．悲哀深深，无以表述，

        那条肯特大街，或许见证，

        她多活一年，该有多好，

        否则不会遗憾，她走得太早。

KING CHARLES II AND WILLIAM PENN


        英王查尔斯二世与威廉·佩恩先生

        King Charles. Well, friend William! I have sold you a noble province in North America; but still, I suppose you have no thoughts of going thither yourself?

        Penn. Yes, I have, I assure thee, friend Charles; and I am just come to bid thee farewell.

        K.C. What! venture yourself among the savages of North America! Why, man, what security have you that you will not be in their war kettle in two hours after setting foot on their shores?

        P. The best security in the world.

        K.C. I doubt that, friend William; I have no idea of any security against those cannibals[158] but in a regiment[159] of good soldiers, with their muskets and bayonets. And mind, I tell you beforehand, that, with all my good will for you and your family, to whom I am under obligations, I will not send a single soldier with you.

        P. I want none of thy soldiers, Charles: I depend on something better than thy soldiers.

        K.C. Ah! what may that be?

        P. Why, I depend upon themselves; on the working of their own hearts; on their notions of justice; on their moral sense.

        K.C. A fine thing, this same moral sense, no doubt; but I fear you will not find much of it among the Indians of North America.

        P. And why not among them as well as others?

        K.C. Because if they had possessed any, they would not have treated my subjects so barbarously as they have done.

        P. That is no proof of the contrary, friend Charles. Thy subjects were the aggressors[160]. When thy subjects first went to North America, they found these poor people the fondest and kindest creatures in the world. Every day they would watch for them to come ashore, and hasten to meet them, and feast them on the best fish, and venison[161], and corn, which were all they had. In return for this hospitality of the savages, as we call them, thy subjects, termed Christians, seized on their country and rich hunting grounds for farms for themselves. Now, is it to be wondered at, that these much-injured people should have been driven to desperation by such injustice; and that, burning with revenge, they should have committed some excesses[162]?





              K C. Well, then, I hope you will not complain when they come to treat you in the same manner.

        P. I am not afraid of it.

        K.C. Ah! how will you avoid it? You mean to get their hunting grounds, too, I suppose?

        P. Yes, but not by driving these poor people away from them.

        K.C. No, indeed? How then will you get their lands?

        P. I mean to buy their lands of them.

        K.C. Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have already bought them of me!

        P. Yes, I know I have, and at a dear rate, too; but I did it only to get thy good will, not that I thought thou hadst any right to their lands.

        K.C. How, man? no right to their lands?

        P. No, friend Charles, no right; no right at all: what right hast thou to their lands?

        K.C. Why, the right of discovery, to be sure; the right which the Pope and all Christian kings have agreed to give one another.

        P. The right of discovery? A strange kind of right, indeed. Now suppose, friend Charles, that some canoe load of these Indians, crossing the sea, and discovering this island of Great Britain, were to claim it as their own, and set it up for sale over thy head, what wouldst thou think of it?

        K.C. Why—why—why—I must confess, I should think it a piece of great impudence in them.

        P. Well, then, how canst thou, a Christian, and a Christian prince, too, do that which thou so utterly condemnest[163] in these people whom thou callest savages? And suppose, again, that these Indians, on thy refusal to give up thy island of Great Britain, were to make war on thee, and, having weapons more destructive than thine, were to destroy many of thy subjects, and drive the rest away—wouldst thou not think it horribly cruel?

        K. C. I must say, friend William, that I should; how can I say otherwise?

        P. Well, then, how can I, who call myself a Christian, do what I should abhor even in the heathen? No. I will not do it. But I will buy the right of the proper owners, even of the Indians themselves. By doing this, I shall imitate God himself in his justice and mercy, and thereby insure his blessing on my colony, if I should ever live to plant one in North America.

        —Mason L. Weems





        Notes.—Charles II. was king of England from A.D. 1660 to 1685. William Penn (b. 1644, d. 1718) was a noted Englishman who belonged to the sect of Friends. He came to America in 1682, and founded the province which is now the state of Pennsylvania. He purchased the lands from the Indians, who were so impressed with the justice and good will of Penn and his associates, that the Quaker dress often served as a sure protection when other settlers were trembling for their lives.

        英王查尔斯：哎，威廉老友！我把北美一处不错的地方交付于你，可是我觉得你根本不想去，对吗？



              佩恩：不，陛下，恰恰相反，我就是来和您道别的。

        英王查尔斯：天呀！你真敢与北美野蛮人厮混一起？呃，一旦你落脚北美海滩，不出两小时，一群土著就会刀斧鸣鼓地对你发动进攻，你如何保住自家性命？



        佩恩：那里才是世上最安全的地方。

        英王查尔斯：安全？威廉，我的朋友，就那些野蛮食人族来说，我完全不知道还有什么安全可言！除非你带上全副武装的军队！听着，我可事先奉告你，出于我的好意，以及我照顾你与你的家庭的责任，我绝对不会派一兵一卒随你去美洲。



        佩恩：我不需要您任何兵卒，查尔斯陛下，我希望不战而屈人之兵。

        佩恩：哎呀！怎么说？

        佩恩：嗯，我要指望他们自己；依赖他们的独立思考、他们的正义观念、包括他们自身道德感。

        英王查尔斯：不错，绝对无须怀疑这种高尚的道德感；可我担心在北美印第安人部落里，你或许难以找到什么道德感。

        佩恩：那么，为什么就道德感来说，他们不如其他民族？

        英王查尔斯：如果印第安人具备哪怕一点点道德意识，他们就不会那么野蛮地杀戮我的臣民了。

        佩恩：查尔斯，我的朋友，难道不存在恰恰相反的证据？陛下臣民才是入侵者，当初踏入那块美洲大地，他们发现，世界上没有人能比那些可怜的土著更温顺平和，待人友好。每天，土著人毫无例外地赶到海滩探望白人，给他们送上最好的鱼、鹿肉、玉米，倾其所有，供其充饥。为回报土著人的好客，正如我们所说的，那些被称为基督徒的陛下臣民，他们强占掠夺印第安人大片家园以及丰美猎场，建起他们自己的农场。如此看来，那些非正义行为使得大量遭受屠戮的土著人沦陷绝境，我们难道不觉惊诧莫名？陛下臣民采用烧杀抢掠手段报复印第安人，那些野蛮屠杀难道并不过分？

        英王查尔斯：好了，今后，土著人若以同样方法对付你，但愿你不要抱怨。

        佩恩：我可不会害怕。

        英王查尔斯：天呀！你怎样避免他们报复？我觉得，你不也想得到他们的狩猎场吗？

        佩恩：不错，我需要土地，不过不会把印第安人从他们的狩猎场上赶出去。

        英王查尔斯：确实如此？那你怎么得到他们的土地？



              佩恩：我打算从他们手中买土地。

        英王查尔斯：从他们手中买土地？哎呀，伙计。你应该是从我的手中买下那些土地吧！

        佩恩：我确实买了土地，价钱还相当高；为什么我这样做，无非考虑到陛下的仁慈，当然，我并不认为，您对印第安人的土地拥有任何权力。

        英王查尔斯：哎呀，伙计，难道我没有支配印第安人土地的权力？

        佩恩：是的，查尔斯，我的朋友，您没有权利，没有任何权力。您有什么权力可以支配那些土著人的土地？

        英王查尔斯：天呀，我有发现的权利，确切地说，罗马教皇和所有基督教国王无一不赞同相互之间给予的权力。

        佩恩：发现的权力？真是莫名其妙。不妨推想一下，查尔斯，我的朋友，假如这些印第安人乘独木舟漂洋过海，最终发现了大不列颠群岛，倘若他们宣称这岛屿属于他们，并在你眼皮底下将其标价出售，你将如何喙置？

        英王查尔斯：呃，呃，呃——我得承认，这实在有点太厚颜无耻了。

        佩恩：那么，好了，一位基督徒，堂堂的基督徒国王，你指控野蛮人最该受到谴责，却对你所称为野蛮的人做出同样最该谴责的事。再假设一下，倘若这些印第安人拒绝放弃你的大不列颠群岛，甚至对你进行开战，手中的武器比你的厉害，他们大规模屠戮你的臣民，再将你的臣民全部撵走，你难道不觉得这种行为恐怖残忍？

        英王查尔斯：威廉，我的朋友，我必须承认，我应该这么说，否则，我还该怎么说？

        佩恩：好了，既然这样，我怎么能，能说自己是基督徒？做那些我最憎恶的事，哪怕针对那些异教徒？不！我不会那样做。但我会从合法的拥有者手中购买权利，即便这些拥有者就是印第安人。通过购买的方式，我无非在效仿上帝本身的正义与悲悯，从而确保上帝佑福降临我管辖的领地，当然，如果，我能在北美洲活下来，先要种下一棵心愿之树。

         For the future in the distance,

        And the good that I can do.

        LESSON 25





THE RIGHTEOUS NEVER FORSAKEN


        公正不会缺席

        1. It was Saturday night, and the widow of the Pine Cottage sat by her blazing fagots[170], with her five tattered children at her side, endeavoring by listening to the artlessness of their prattle[171] to dissipate[172] the heavy gloom that pressed upon her mind. For a year, her own feeble hand had provided for her helpless family, for she had no supporter: she thought of no friend in all the wide, unfriendly world around.

        2. But that mysterious Providence, the wisdom of whose ways is above human comprehension, had visited her with wasting sickness, and her little means had become exhausted. It was now, too, midwinter, and the snow lay heavy and deep through all the surrounding forests, while storms still seemed gathering in the heavens, and the driving wind roared amid the neighboring pines, and rocked her puny[173] mansion.

        3. The last herring smoked upon the coals before her; it was the only article of food she possessed, and no wonder her forlorn, desolate state brought up in her lone bosom all the anxieties of a mother when she looked upon her children: and no wonder, forlorn as she was, if she suffered the heart swellings of despair to rise, even though she knew that He, whose promise is to the widow and to the orphan, can not forget his word.

        4. Providence had many years before taken from her her eldest son, who went from his forest home to try his fortune on the high seas, since which she had heard no tidings of him; and in her latter time had, by the hand of death, deprived her of the companion and staff of her earthly pilgrimage[174], in the person of her husband. Yet to this hour she had upborne; she had not only been able to provide for her little flock, but had never lost an opportunity of ministering to the wants of the miserable and destitute.

        5. The indolent may well bear with poverty while the ability to gain sustenance[175] remains. The individual who has but his own wants to supply may suffer with fortitude[176] the winter of want; his affections are not wounded, his heart is not wrung. The most desolate in populous cities may hope, for charity has not quite closed her hand and heart, and shut her eyes on misery.

        6. But the industrious mother of helpless and depending children, far from the reach of human charity, has none of these to console her. And such a one was the widow of the Pine Cottage; but as she bent over the fire, and took up the last scanty remnant of food to spread before her children, her spirits seemed to brighten up, as by some sudden and mysterious impulse, and Cowper’s beautiful lines came uncalled across her mind:





         “Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.

        But trust him for his grace;

         Behind a frowning Providence

        He hides a smiling face.”





        7. The smoked herring was scarcely laid upon the table, when a gentle rap at the door, and the loud barking of a dog, attracted the attention of the family. The children flew to open it, and a weary traveler, in tattered garments and in apparently indifferent[177] health; entered, and begged a lodging and a mouthful of food. Said he: “It is now twenty-four hour’s since I tasted bread.” The widow’s heart bled anew, as under a fresh complication[178] of distresses; for her sympathies[179] lingered not around her fireside. She hesitated not even now; rest, and a share of all she had, she proffered[180] to the stranger. “We shall not be forsaken,” said she, “or suffer deeper for an act of charity.”

        8. The traveler drew near the board, but when he saw the scanty fare, he raised his eyes toward heaven with astonishment: “And is this all your store?” said he; “and a share of this do you offer to one you know not? then never saw I charity before! But, madam,” said he, continuing, “do you not wrong your children by giving a part of your last mouthful to a stranger?”

        9. “Ah,” said the poor widow—and the tear-drops gushed into her eyes as she said it—“I have a boy, a darling son, somewhere on the face of the wide world, unless Heaven has taken him away, and I only act toward you as I would that others should act toward him. God, who sent manna[181] from heaven, can provide for us as he did for Israel; and how should I this night offend him, if my son should be a wanderer, destitute as you, and he should have provided for him a home, even poor as this, were I to turn you unrelieved away!”

        10. The widow ended, and the stranger, springing from his seat, clasped her in his arms. “God indeed has provided your son a home, and has given him wealth to reward the goodness of his benefactress: my mother! oh, my mother!” It was her long lost son, returned to her bosom from the Indies. He had chosen that disguise that he might the more completely surprise his family; and never was surprise more perfect, or followed by a sweeter cup of joy.


【中文阅读】

        1．一个周六的夜晚，一座松木搭建的小屋里，一位寡妇坐在燃烧的火堆旁，五个衣衫褴褛的孩子依偎在她的身边。她强打精神，听着周围咿呀吵闹，孩子们不谙人世的纯真，或许消散她内心些许沉重阴霾。一年来，她用羸弱的双手独自撑起这个呼告无门的家。在这个偌大寒冷的世界上，她举目无亲，无所可依。



              2．然而，天意神秘不可知。那位超越人类认知的睿者，目睹了她的病弱之躯，她那微薄家产逐渐消耗殆尽。适逢仲冬，四周森林莽野，雪下得很大，很厚，暴风雪仍在天空不断聚集，狂风在松林里呼啸翻卷，摇撼着她和她的孩子那间可怜的木屋。

        3．最后一条鲱鱼在她面前炉火上燎起轻烟，那是她仅剩的最后一点食物。毫不奇怪，她看着玩耍的孩子们，一丝绝望情绪在她无助的内心蔓延，那是一个母亲的呼救无门；毋庸多说，她倍感孤独，尽管她明白，对一户孤儿寡母来说，上帝不会忘记它的诺言，她还是感觉到最后的绝望在她心底慢慢隆起，隆起那道彻骨的冰凉。

        4．很多年前，上帝带走了她的大儿子。那年，他离开了森林里的家，去海上淘金。从那以后，母亲再亦没有听到他的音讯；随后，死亡之神最终夺去她的丈夫——她世俗生活中的伴侣以及家庭支柱。即便那时，她仍然还有支撑下去的信念，她静心地照料她的孩子们，亦从未错过任何机会对更为贫困潦倒的人伸出援手。

        5．懒惰很可能和贫穷与生俱来，但维持生存能力依然还在，唯有那些给予奉献的个体，坚韧不拔地面对物质的极度匮乏，从而饱经尘世苦难；她的钟爱不会受伤，她的心灵亦不会榨干。在人口稠密的喧嚣城市，最为孤独的人或许心怀希望，因为慈善的人会向她打开心灵之窗，慈善的人不会对她的悲惨熟视无睹。

        6．然而，这位勤劳无助而依赖孩子的母亲，远离人间行善，亦未曾接受任何仁慈，以安慰她那颗饱经苍凉的心。一位松树木屋里的寡母，当她弯身从火堆里拿出家里仅存的食物，分给面前嗷嗷待哺的孩子，她的心情似乎略微轻松，仿佛某种突如其来的神秘感召，库柏的优美诗句蓦然在她的心头响起：





        不要用你微弱感知判断上帝，

        相信他的宽宏慈悲，

        一个蹙眉的上帝身后，

        它藏匿了自己笑脸。





        7．烟熏的鲱鱼刚刚放到桌上，门上响起轻轻的叩门声，狗的大声吠叫，吸引了全家人目光。孩子们飞快跑过去打开门，一位衣着褴褛的过路人走进屋，他面色疲惫，神情淡然，祈求主人能否给他安顿住处，再给他点吃的东西。他说，“我已经一天一夜没吃一点东西了。”那位母亲的心突然又揪痛起来，新的困厄到来更是雪上加霜；毕竟，她的同情心不会让她无动于衷地坐在火堆边，哪怕现在，也不会犹豫不决。她请陌生人和全家一起分享食物。她对他说，“哪怕付出的善行再小，我们亦不该被上帝抛弃或者遭难更多。”



              8．那位来客走近桌子，看见桌上那丁点食物，他仰起头惊讶地问，“所有食物就这些？难道你还愿意与陌生人分享？这是我未曾见过的慈悲！不过，夫人，”他说，“给陌生人哪怕一口吃的，难道不委屈你的孩子们吗？”

        9．“哎，”那位寡母叹了口气，泪如泉涌，“我有个儿子，伶俐可爱，只有圣父才能将他带走，他现在一定还活在这世上某个地方。我为你做这点事，就是指望别人亦能这样善待他。我的上帝，谁能从天上为我们孤儿寡母带回他的恩赐，就像他当年赐予以色列人那样？假如我的孩子也在流浪，和你一样无助无望，他也该有个地方可以过夜，风寒抵御，哪怕和我们这间小屋如此简陋，如果我拒绝落难中的你，我怎能指望别人亦能为他做点什么！”

        10．那位寡母刚说完，陌生人“腾”地一声站起，将她揽进怀里，“上帝确实为你的儿子准备了住所，并且赐予他财富，以报答母亲的养育之恩，妈妈！噢，我的妈妈！”原来，这位陌生人正是寡妇失去音讯很久的儿子。他刚从印度群岛返回，原本想给全家一个惊喜，才装扮成过路人进屋打听。这真是让全家人意想不到的天大惊喜，随后，狭小木屋顿时变成一片欢乐的海洋。





        LESSON 26





ABOU BEN ADHEM


        阿博·本·艾德汉姆

        James Henry Leigh Hunt (b. 1784, d. 1859) was the son of a West Indian, who married an American lady, and practiced law in Philadelphia until the Revolution; being a Tory, he then returned to England, where Leigh Hunt was born. The latter wrote many verses while yet a boy, and in 1801 his father published a collection of them, entitled “Juvenilia.” For many years he was connected with various newspapers, and, while editor of the “Examiner,” was imprisoned for two years for writing disrespectfully of the prince regent. While in prison he was visited frequently by the poets Byron, Moore, Lamb, Shelley, and Keats; and there wrote “The Feast of the Poets,” “The Descent of Liberty, a Mask,” and “The Story of Rimini,” which immediately gave him a reputation as a poet. His writings include various translations, dramas, novels, collections of essays, and poems.





        1.ABOU BEN ADHEM (may his tribe increase!)

        Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,

        And saw within the moonlight in his room,

        Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,

        An angel writing in a book of gold.





        2.Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold;

        And to the presence in the room he said,

        “What writest thou?” The vision raised its head,

        And, with a look made of all sweet accord,

        Answered, “The names of those who love the Lord.”





        3.“And is mine one?” said Abou. “Nay, not so,”

         Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,

         But cheerly still; and said, “I pray thee, then,

         Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.”





        4.The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night

         It came again, with a great wakening light,

         And showed the names whom love of God had blessed;

         And, lo! Ben Adhem’s name led all the rest.

        LESSON 27





LUCY FORESTER[1]




        露西·福斯特

        John Wilson (b. 1785, d. 1854), better known as “Christopher North,” was a celebrated author, poet, and critic, born at Paisley, Scotland, and educated at the University of Glasgow and at Oxford. In 1808 he moved to Westmoreland, England, where he formed one of the “Lake School” of poets. While at Oxford he gained a prize for a poem on “Painting, Poetry, and Architecture.” In 1820 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, which position he retained until 1851. He gained his greatest reputation as the chief author of “Noctes Ambrosianae,” essays contributed to Blackwood’s Magazine between 1822 and 1825. Among his poems may be mentioned “The Isle of Palms” and the “City of the Plague,” This selection is adapted from “The Foresters,” a tale of Scottish life.





        1. Lucy was only six years old, but bold as a fairy; she had gone by herself a thousand times about the braes[2], and often upon errands to houses two or three miles distant. What had her parents to fear? The footpaths were all firm, and led to no places of danger, nor are infants themselves incautious when alone in then pastimes[3]. Lucy went singing into the low woods, and singing she reappeared on the open hillside. With her small white hand on the rail, she glided along the wooden bridge, or tripped from stone to stone across the shallow streamlet.

        2. The creature would be away for hours, and no fear be felt on her account by anyone at home; whether she had gone, with her basket on her arm, to borrow some articles of household use from a neighbor, or, merely for her own solitary delight, had wandered off to the braes to play among the flowers, coming back laden with wreaths and garlands.

        3. The happy child had been invited to pass a whole day, from morning to night, at Ladyside (a farmhouse about two miles off) with her playmates the Maynes; and she left home about an hour after sunrise.

        4. During her absence, the house was silent but happy, and, the evening being now far advanced, Lucy was expected home every minute, and Michael, Agnes, and Isabel, her father, mother, and aunt, went to meet her on the way. They walked on and on, wondering a little, but in no degree alarmed till they reached Ladyside, and heard the cheerful din of the children within, still rioting[4] at the close of the holiday. Jacob Mayne came to the door, but, on their kindly asking why Lucy had not been sent home before daylight was over, he looked painfully surprised, and said that she had not been at Ladyside.



              5. Within two hours, a hundred persons were traversing the hills in all directions, even at a distance which it seemed most unlikely that poor Lucy could have reached. The shepherds and their dogs, all the night through, searched every nook, every stony and rocky place, every piece of taller heather[5], every crevice that could conceal anything alive or dead: but no Lucy was there.

        6. Her mother, who for a while seemed inspired[6] with supernatural[7] strength, had joined in the search, and with a quaking heart looked into every brake[8], or stopped and listened to every shout and halloo reverberating[9] among the hills, intent[10] to seize upon some tone of recognition or discovery. But the moon sank; and then the stars, whose increased brightness had for a short time supplied her place, all faded away; and then came the gray dawn of the morning, and then the clear brightness of the day,—and still Michael and Agnes were childless.

        7. “She has sunk into some mossy or miry place,” said Michael, to a man near him, into whose face he could not look, “a cruel, cruel death to one like her! The earth on which my child walked has closed over her, and we shall never see her more!”

        8. At last, a man who had left the search, and gone in a direction toward the highroad, came running with something in his arms toward the place where Michael and others were standing beside Agnes, who lay, apparently exhausted almost to dying, on the sward. He approached hesitatingly; and Michael saw that he carried Lucy’s bonnet, clothes, and plaid[11].

        9. It was impossible not to see some spots of blood upon the frill that the child had worn around her neck. “Murdered! murdered!” was the one word whispered or ejaculated[12] all around; but Agnes heard it not; for, worn out by that long night of hope and despair, she had fallen asleep, and was, perhaps, seeking her lost Lucy in her dreams.

        10. Isabel took the clothes, and, narrowly inspecting them with eye and hand, said, with a fervent voice that was heard even in Michael’s despair, “No, Lucy is yet among the living. There are no marks of violence on the garments of the innocent; no murderer’s hand has been here. These blood spots have been put here to deceive. Besides, would not the murderer have carried off these things? For what else would he have murdered her? But, oh! foolish despair! What speak I of ? For, wicked as the world is—ay! desperately wicked—there is not, on all the surface of the wide earth, a hand that would murder our child! Is it not plain as the sun in the heaven, that Lucy has been stolen by some wretched gypsy beggar?”

        11. The crowd quietly dispersed, and horse and foot began to scour[13] the country. Some took the highroads, others all the bypaths, and many the trackless hills. Now that they were in some measure relieved from the horrible belief that the child was dead, the worst other calamity seemed nothing, for hope brought her back to their arms.



              12. Agnes had been able to walk home to Bracken-Braes, and Michael and Isabel sat by her bedside. All her strength was gone, and she lay at the mercy of the rustle of a leaf, or a shadow across the window. Thus hour after hour passed, till it was again twilight. “I hear footsteps coming up the brae,” said Agnes, who had for some time appeared to be slumbering; and in a few moments the voice of Jacob Mayne was heard at the outer door.

        13. Jacob wore a solemn expression of countenance, and he seemed, from his looks, to bring no comfort. Michael stood up between him and his wife, and looked into his heart. Something there seemed to be in his face that was not miserable. “If he has heard nothing of my child,” thought Michael, “this man must care little for his own fireside.” “Oh, speak, speak,” said Agnes; “yet why need you speak? All this has been but a vain belief, and Lucy is in heaven.”

        14. “Something like a trace of her has been discovered; a woman, with a child that did not look like a child of hers, was last night at Clovenford, and left it at the dawning.” “Do you hear that, my beloved Agnes?” said Isabel; “she will have tramped away with Lucy up into Ettrick or Yarrow; but hundreds of eyes will have been upon her; for these are quiet but not solitary glens; and the hunt will be over long before she has crossed down upon Hawick. I knew that country in my young days, What say you, Mr. Mayne? There is the light of hope in your face.” “There is no reason to doubt, ma’am, that it was Lucy. Everybody is sure of it. If it was my own Rachel, I should have no fear as to seeing her this blessed night.”

        15. Jacob Mayne now took a chair, and sat down, with even a smile upon his countenance. “I may tell you now, that Watty Oliver knows it was your child, for he saw her limping along after the gypsy at Galla-Brigg; but, having no suspicion, he did not take a second look at her,—but one look is sufficient, and he swears it was bonny Lucy Forester.”

        16. Aunt Isabel, by this time, had bread and cheese and a bottle of her own elder-flower wine on the table. “You have been a long and hard journey, wherever you have been, Mr. Mayne; take some refreshment;” and Michael asked a blessing.

        17. Jacob saw that he might now venture to reveal the whole truth. “No, no, Mrs. Irving, I am over happy to eat or to drink. You are all prepared for the blessing that awaits you. Your child is not far off; and I myself, for it is I myself that found her, will bring her by the hand, and restore her to her parents.”

        18. Agnes had raised herself up in her bed at these words, but she sank gently back on her pillow; aunt Isabel was rooted to her chair; and Michael, as he rose up, felt as if the ground were sinking under his feet. There was a dead silence all around the house for a short space, and then the sound of many voices, which again by degrees subsided. The eyes of all then looked, and yet feared to look, toward the door.

        19. Jacob Mayne was not so good as his word, for he did not bring Lucy by the hand to restore her to her parents; but dressed again in her own bonnet and gown, and her own plaid, in rushed their own child, by herself, with tears and sobs of joy, and her father laid her within her mother’s bosom.

        约翰 · 威尔逊（1785～1854），又称北方的克里斯托弗，后者更广为人知。威尔逊为著名作家、诗人兼评论家，他出生于苏格兰佩斯利，曾在格拉斯哥大学和牛津大学求学。1808年，他搬到英格兰威斯特摩兰，并建立“英国湖畔诗”流派分系。在牛津大学求学期间，他曾以一首题为《绘画，诗歌和建筑》的诗歌荣膺奖项。1820年，威尔逊成为英国爱丁堡大学伦理学教授，并一直任职到1851年。作为《安部罗斯那对话》一书首席作者，1822～1825年期间，该书在《黑檀木》杂志上连载，使其声名鹊起。他的诗歌《棕榈岛》和《瘟疫城》尤为值得一提。本章节由《林务官》删节改编，描写一位苏格兰人的生活故事。





        1.露西不过六岁，自命不凡地总想做仙女。她不计其数地独自攀爬房前屋后的陡坡，经常被差遣到两三英里外的地方。露西父母没有什么好担心的，孩子走路坚实有力，所到之处没有危险，即便露西单独玩耍时，也不像其他孩子那样不够谨慎小心。露西喜欢唱着歌走进低矮的灌林，她重复吟唱的稚嫩歌声在山坡上飘荡回响，她白嫩的小手扶着栏杆，时而飞快走过木桥，时而在浅窄溪水的石头上蹦来蹦去。

        2.小家伙一连好几个钟头不沾家，家里没人担心她，不管她去哪里玩，胳膊上挎只小花篮，或从邻居那借点家什物件，或不过独自玩耍的开心。她撒丫子在山涧花丛昏天黑地地玩，然后满筐野花野草拎回家。

        3.快乐的小姑娘总会和她的玩伴梅恩斯受邀去女人坡（两英里外一处农庄），整天在那开心玩耍。通常，露西日出一小时后离开家。她走后，家里显得安静祥和，可现在天黑早了，家里人惦记她早点回家。

        4.她的父母迈克尔、艾格尼丝，还有婶婶伊莎贝尔都去路上接她。大家有点纳闷地走呀走，不知不觉中竟然来到了女人坡，隐约听到屋里面孩子们的嬉笑打闹，聚会快结束了，依然喧闹翻天。雅各·梅恩过来开门，可听到来客礼貌地询问为何露西没有在天黑前赶到家，顿时，他神色惊愕地告诉他们，今天露西没来女人坡。

        5.接下来两小时里，上百人从四面八方到处搜索，甚至连露西完全不可能走到的地方也去了。整整一夜，那些牧羊人带上他们的牧羊犬，找遍了山间野外所有能想到的旮旯角落，甚至每处石缝沟壑、灌丛树林，那些可以藏身匿尸的所有地方，但，没有发现露西。

        6.似乎由某种超自然力量支撑，露西母亲一度亦参加了夜间搜索，她胆战心惊地查看途经的茂密丛林。夜色苍茫，山岭野外，“嗨—嗨—”的呼唤声不时在山间沟壑回荡，每一声都让露西母亲挂肚牵肠，她不时停下，聆听呼喊声中是否夹有欢乐或惊喜。月亮落山了，星星随之落下，她的心里刹那涌出丁点欣喜，夜幕黯淡隐去，清晨煦光乍露，惯常一轮艳阳腾空而起，露西父母迈克尔和艾格尼丝仍然没有孩子的消息。



              7.“露西或许陷进沼泽或泥泞的地方了，”迈克尔对身边的一个男人说，他没法直视那男人的脸，“对她来说，那么残忍的、无法想象的死亡！我的孩子，你究竟在哪里陷进去了？我们难道再也见不到你吗？”

        8.搜索队有人早已离开，独自往公路方向寻找，后来，有人朝迈克尔站的地方跑过来，胳膊上好像还抱着什么东西，艾格尼丝躺在草地上，明显看起来筋疲力尽似乎濒死的模样，大家纷纷围着她。来人犹豫着走近，迈克尔看清楚了，他怀里抱着露西的衣帽，还有外套。

        9.不难看出，孩子脖颈处的帽褶地方有斑点血迹，“谋杀，这是谋杀！”周围不约而同的窃窃私语或高声叫嚷响成一片。但是，母亲艾格尼丝听不见了，整整一夜希望与绝望的反复折磨后，她早已睡着了，或许正在梦里寻找她的可爱露西。



        10.婶婶伊莎贝尔拿过衣服，仔细察看一番，急切地说，“露西还活着，这些衣物上没有任何施暴者的痕迹。”她的声音给绝望的迈克尔带来希望，“不会是谋杀。这些血迹好像有意要隐藏什么。况且，为什么谋杀犯为什么不把这些衣物带走？他（她）又是为什么要杀害她呢？天呀，没有必要绝望！让我说什么好呢？这邪恶的世道！唉呀，简直太邪恶了！在世界上所有地方，但愿不会再有罪恶的手摧残我们的孩子！露西肯定被那些卑鄙无耻的吉卜赛乞丐偷走了，这点，难道不正像天底下阳光那样最简单明白？”

        11.人群很快散去了，马匹或脚印很快将布满周边区域。有人去大路搜索，有人去岔道追踪，还有很多人去那些偏僻的山隘小路寻找。此刻，大伙都从孩子已不在世上的可怕念想中解脱出来，更坏的灾祸看来绝不可能，生的希望已把露西重新带回众人怀抱。

        12.艾格尼丝走过蕨丛簇密的山坡，回到家倒床不起，她看来完全筋疲力尽，迈克尔和伊莎贝尔坐在她的床边。窗外，树叶沙沙，越过窗棂的阴影，周围仿佛沉浸一片悲戚之中。时间一点点流逝，直到满天星斗再现。“我听见有人爬上山坡。”艾格尼丝说着，似乎愣了愣神，不一会，雅各 · 梅恩的声音在门外响起。

        13.雅各 · 梅恩脸色凝重，从他表情来看，似乎并没有什么好消息。迈克尔在来客和夫人间站起，急切想从他的脸上寻到答案。雅各 · 梅恩此刻表情看来并非那么糟。“如果他没有露西的消息，”迈克尔心想，“看来不可能的，他对自己家庭的关心，亦不过如此。”“哦，说吧，说呀，”艾格尼丝焦急地问，转而又说：“还说什么好呢？所有不过虚妄之想，露西已经走了。”



              14.“怀疑与露西有关的线索已经发现，昨晚在卡楼福德，一位妇女，带着孩子，那孩子看起来并不像她亲生的，今天拂晓离开了。”“亲爱的艾格尼丝，你听到这消息吗？”伊莎贝尔急切地问道，然后接着说，“那吉卜赛女人肯定带着露西赶往埃特里克或亚罗，可好几百双眼睛不会放过她的，那些山道关隘尽管人烟稀少，但总会有人蹲守，甚至等不到那女人穿山越岭下来赶到霍伊克，我们就会抓住她。我打小对这块地区相当熟悉，你想说什么？梅恩先生？你的脸上露出希望。”“没有理由怀疑，伊莎贝尔，那孩子就是露西，没有人不相信。倘若那是我的女儿，在这个上帝赐福的夜晚，我根本不害怕弄清真相。”

        15.这时，雅各·梅恩拖过一把椅子坐下，脸上甚至浮出一丝笑容。“现在可以告诉你们，沃蒂·奥利弗认识你们的女儿，当时在加拉·布瑞格，他看见露西一跛一拐地跟在那吉卜赛女人身后，由于压根没怀疑，他只不过看了那孩子一眼，一眼就足够了。他发誓，那孩子就是漂亮的小露西·福斯特。”

        16.这时，伊莎贝尔婶婶把面包、奶酪还有自酿的一瓶接骨木花酒摆上了餐桌。“你肯定走了很远山路，路上那么难走，四处寻找，辛苦你了，梅恩先生，请吃点东西吧。”迈克尔亦随声附和。

        17.雅各心里清楚，说出真相的时候到了。“不，别急，欧文夫人，我实在太开心了，什么吃喝也不想。对于等待已久的圣灵赐福，你们大家心里肯定有所准备。你们孩子就在附近，是我亲自找到她的，亲手把她带回家，将她重新交到她父母的手中。”

        18.听到这话，艾格尼丝飞快地从床上起身，但她的头仍无力地落到了枕头上；伊莎贝尔婶婶呆坐片刻，半晌没回过神来；迈克尔站了起来，仿佛天塌地陷。房间里弥漫着死一般寂静，随即爆发出一片欢快嘈杂，好一会才平息下来。所有目光都注视门口，似乎惴惴不安，又害怕张望。

        19.雅各 · 梅恩的话没有兑现，他并未亲手将孩子送到她父母的手中；露西还是往常一身装扮，她戴着帽子，穿着裙子，套着那件斜纹外衣，不由分说地冲了过来；迈克尔悲喜交加，难以自禁，一把抱起女儿，将她投入母亲的怀抱。





        LESSON 28





THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS


        花朵与死亡

        Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (b. 1807, d. 1882), the son of Hon. Stephen Longfellow, an eminent lawyer, was born in Portland, Maine. He graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825. After spending four years in Europe, he was Professor of Modern Languages and Literature at Bowdoin till 1835, when he was appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in Harvard University. He resigned his professorship in 1854, after which time he resided in Cambridge, Mass. Longfellow wrote many original works both in verse and prose, and made several translations, the most famous of which is that of the works of Dante. His poetry is always chaste and elegant, showing traces of careful scholarship in every line. The numerous and varied editions of his poems are evidences of their popularity.





        1. There is a Reaper whose name is Death,

        And, with his sickle keen,

         He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,

        And the flowers that grow between.





        2. “Shall I have naught that is fair?” saith he;

        “Have naught but the bearded grain?

         Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,

        I will give them all back again.”





        3. He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,

        He kissed their drooping leaves;

         It was for the Lord of Paradise

        He bound them in his sheaves[14].





        4. “My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,”

        The Reaper said, and smiled;

         “Dear tokens[15] of the earth are they,

        Where he was once a child.





        5. “They shall all bloom in the fields of light,

        Transplanted[16] by my care,

         And saints, upon their garments white,

        These sacred blossoms wear.”



              6. And the mother gave in tears and pain

        The flowers she most did love;

         She knew she should find them all again

        In the fields of light above.

        7. O, not in cruelty, not in wrath,

        The Reaper came that day,

         ’T was an angel visited the green earth,

        And took the flowers away.

        芳香满地，难诉别离衷肠，

        这一别，已是绝尘万里，

        望断秋水，几多妖娆难觅。





        7. 噢，不要残忍，不要愤怒，

        死亡之神，终于降临，

        “翩然天使，来到绿色大地，

        倏然带走，恍然如梦仙境。”





        LESSON 29





THE TOWN PUMP


        小镇水泵

        Nathaniel Hawthorne (b.1804, d.1864) was born in Salem, Mass. He graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825. His earliest literary productions, written for periodicals, were published in two volumes—the first in 1837, the second in 1842—under the title of “Twice-Told Tales,” “Mosses from an Old Manse,” another series of tales and sketches, was published in 1845. From 1846 to 1850 he was surveyor of the port of Salem. In 1852 he was appointed United States consul for Liverpool. After holding this office four years, he traveled for some time on the continent. His most popular works are “The Scarlet Letter,” a work showing a deep knowledge of human nature, “The House of the Seven Gables,” “The Blithedale Romance.” and “The Marble Faun,” an Italian romance, which is regarded by many as the best of his works. Being of a modest and retiring disposition, Mr. Hawthorne avoided publicity. Most of his works are highly imaginative. As a prose writer he has no superior among American authors. He died at Plymouth, N. H., while on a visit to the White Mountains for his health.





        [SCENE.—The corner of two principal streets. The Town Pump talking through its nose.]

        1. Noon, by the north clock! Noon, by the east! High noon, too, by those hot sunbeams which fall, scarcely aslope, upon my head, and almost make the water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose. Truly, we public characters have a tough time of it! And among all the town officers, chosen at the yearly meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single year, the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity[17], upon the Town Pump?

        2. The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine, as guardian of the best treasure the town has. The overseers of the poor ought to make me their chairman, since I provide bountifully for the pauper, without expense to him that pays taxes. I am at the head of the fire department, and one of the physicians of the board of health. As a keeper or the peace, all water drinkers confess me equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties of the town clerk, by promulgating[18] public notices, when they are pasted on my front.

        3. To speak within bounds, I am chief person of the municipality[19], and exhibit, moreover, an admirable pattern to my brother officers by the cool, steady, upright, downright, and impartial discharge of my business, and the constancy with which I stand to my post. Summer or winter, nobody seeks me in vain; for all day long I am seen at the busiest corner, just above the market, stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike; and at night I hold a lantern over my head, to show where I am, and to keep people out of the gutters.

        4. At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace, for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist Like a dramseller on the public square, on a muster[20] day, I cry aloud to all and sundry[21], in my plainest accents, and at the very tiptop of my voice. “Here it is, gentlemen! Here is the good liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up, walk up! Here is the superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated[22] ale of father Adam! better than Cognac[23], Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine of any price; here it is, by the hogshead or the single glass, and not a cent to pay. Walk up, gentlemen, walk up and help yourselves!”



              5. It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here they come. A hot day, gentlemen. Quaff and away again, so as to keep yourselves in a nice, cool sweat. You, my friend, will need another cupful to wash the dust out of your throat, if it be as thick there as it is on your cowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half a score of miles to-day, and, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at the running brooks and well curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without and fire within, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or melted down to nothing at all—in the fashion of a jellyfish.

        6. Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to quench the fiery fever of last night’s potations[24], which he drained from no cup of mine. Welcome, most rubicund[25] sir! You and I have been strangers hitherto; nor, to confess the truth, will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy, till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent.

        7. Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses down your red-hot gullet, and is converted quite into steam in the miniature Tophet[26], which you mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an honest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any other kind of dramshop, spend the price of your children’s food for a swig half so delicious? Now, for the first time these ten years, you know the flavor of cold water. Good-by; and whenever you are thirsty, recollect that I keep a constant supply at the old stand.

        8. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let loose from school, and come hither to scrub your blooming face, and drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule, and other schoolboy troubles, in a draught from the Town Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young life; take it, and may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than now.

        9. There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield your place to this elderly gentleman, who treads so tenderly over the paving stones that I suspect he is afraid of breaking them. What! he limps by without so much as thanking me, as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who have no wine cellars.

        10. Well, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw the cork, tip the decanter; but when your great toe shall set you a-roaring, it will be no affair of mine. If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation[27] of the gout, it is all one to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red tongue lolling out, does not scorn my hospitality, but stands on his hind legs, and laps eagerly out of the trough. See how lightly he capers away again! Jowler, did your worship ever have the gout?



              11. Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my stream of eloquence, and spout forth a stream of water to replenish[28] the trough for this teamster and his two yoke of oxen, who have come all the way from Staunton, or somewhere along that way. No part of my business gives me more pleasure than the watering of cattle. Look! how rapidly they lower the watermark on the sides of the trough, till their capacious stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece, and they can afford time to breathe, with sighs of calm enjoyment! Now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinking vessel. An ox is your true toper.

        12. I hold myself the grand reformer of the age. From my spout, and such spouts as mine, must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of a vast portion of its crime and anguish, which have gushed from the fiery fountains of the still. In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall be my great confederate. Milk and water!

        13. Ahem! Dry work this speechifying, especially to all unpracticed orators. I never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers undergo for my sake. Do, some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just to wet my whistle. Thank you, sir. But to proceed.





              14. The Town Pump and the Cow! Such is the glorious partnership that shall finally monopolize[29] the whole business of quenching thirst. Blessed consummation[30]! Then Poverty shall pass away from the land, finding no hovel so wretched where her squalid[31] form may shelter itself. Then Disease, for lack of other victims, shall gnaw his own heart and die. Then Sin, if she do not die, shall lose half her strength.

        15. Then there will be no war of households. The husband and the wife, drinking deep of peaceful joy, a calm bliss of temperate affections, shall pass hand in hand through life, and lie down, not reluctantly, at its protracted[32] close. To them the past will be no turmoil of mad dreams, nor the future an eternity of such moments as follow the delirium of a drunkard. Their dead faces shall express what their spirits were, and are to be, by a lingering smile of memory and hope.

        16. Drink, then, and be refreshed! The water is as pure and cold as when it slaked[33] the thirst of the red hunter, and flowed beneath the aged bough, though now this gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot stones, where no shadow falls, but from the brick buildings. But, still is this fountain the source of health, peace, and happiness, and I behold, with certainty and joy, the approach of the period when the virtues of cold water, too little valued since our father’s days, will be fully appreciated and recognized by all.

        [幕景两个主要街道交口。小镇水泵在用鼻子说话]



        1.中午，北方时钟报时！中午，东方时钟报时！正午，那炽火的光几乎垂直泻落到我的头顶，我鼻子下水槽里的水即将沸腾冒烟，坦率地说，我们这些公众人物居然身受如此磨难。如果镇政府大小一干官员，若有人被选中参加小镇年度会议，是否意味一年内他应该履行那些五花八门的职责，类似那些被永久赋予小镇水泵身上的诸多义务？



              2.通过某种正当方式，我被授以小镇财务长官的头衔，如同小镇那些宝贵资产的监护人。那些济贫会执事们真该提名我为主席，由于我慷慨地为乞丐或贫民提供帮助，更无需让他们缴税。我是小镇消防部门当仁不让的主管，同时行使镇上卫生理事会医生的崇高职责。作为小镇的维护者，或者毋庸说安宁生活的守护者，所有饮水居民无不承认我的作用好比治安巡警。一旦镇政府颁布公告张贴到我的身上，我甚至亦能履行小镇官员的相应管理义务。

        3.就言论许可范围来说，我是小镇当局的重要人物兼政务形象。此外，鉴于我的冷静稳定、诚信爽直，以及公正地胜任工作，坚持履行职责，对我的兄弟官员来说，难保不成为令人钦佩的光辉榜样。无论寒寒暑秋冬，无论什么人，我一概有求必应。从早到晚，我成天呆在市场上最繁忙的地方，不管穷人富人，都是以礼相待。每逢夜晚，我会在我的头顶挂上一盏灯，表明我的存在，提醒镇上居民小心沟坎。

        4.在这个闷热难当的中午，我成了为那些干渴市民斟水上茶的跑堂，我尽心为他们服务，腰上别挂个铁制酒杯，就像公众广场游行集会上的酒厂推销员。对那些南来北往的人，我用最道地的口音，对那些南来北往的人大声叫喊，“快来看呀，女士们，先生们，清爽甘甜的饮料！快点来呀，快来看呀！女士们，先生们，快点来呀，快来看呀！这可是上等的饮料，货真价实的亚当父亲的麦酒！比法国白兰地酒、荷兰杜松子酒、牙买加酒、高浓度啤酒，甭管多高价钱的酒还要棒！饮料大卖啦！无论你要上一大桶，还是只喝一小杯，统统无需付一个子儿。快来呀，女士们，先生们，快点呀，赶快来敞开肚子喝个痛快吧！”

        5.万一这样大声吆喝还不能吸引顾客，那可真够遗憾的。看！有人来了。天这么热，先生们，大口狂饮吧，喝好再离开。多么透彻清凉！多么畅快淋漓！我的朋友们，你们还得再来一杯，好好漱漱你们满嘴尘土的喉咙。如果满脸风尘仆仆，想必今天你长途跋涉而来。每当路过客栈或酒馆，你总会在河溪旁或井栏边停下脚步，那才是明智的首选。否则，面对内热与外火的里外夹攻，你很可能被灼成一团热碳慢慢燃尽，或类似软耷无力的海蜇最后干涸死去。

        6.喝吧，再给那家伙腾点地方。此刻，那醉醺醺的家伙需要我，才能平息他内心的炽烈。昨晚，他饮尽的全是酒，没有一滴水。欢迎你！面颊通红的先生！你我至今素不相识，亦没有说过心里话，但愿我能与你贴得更近些，稍微减轻点你的炙热痛苦。



              7.可怜的人，我怜悯你！水可以彻底消退你咽喉的烈火煎熬，在你喉腔的微小地狱里全部化为缕缕水气，可你误把喉咙当做胃，不停地牛饮海灌猫尿。请你以诚实酒鬼的名义告诉我，是否曾经在地窖或酒馆、甚至像样点的酒吧，挥霍花尽你孩子的生活费，一大口喝下大半瓶，痛饮中不能自抑？十年来，你第一次终究明白了凉水滋味。再见，无论什么时候，倘若再干渴冒火，不妨回想一下，我会在老地方给你送上清冽甘甜的凉水。

        8.下一个轮到谁？哦，我的小朋友。你不过想从紧张的校园里放松自己。过来！洗洗你那花朵般的小脸，暂时忘掉学校里那些清规戒律，还有与小伙伴争吵的闷闷不乐。在小镇水泵这里痛快地喝上一气，喝吧，这水纯净得好像你年轻生命启程的小溪；喝吧，但愿你的身心永远不会像现在受尽饥渴的折磨。

        9.过来，我可爱的孩子，放下杯子，给走过来这位年迈绅士让条路来。老人缓步地走过街上石子路，脚步很轻，我怀疑他似乎害怕会把石子踩碎。天呀！那老人蹒跚地走过，压根没想到对我心存感激，好像我的好意不过为了那些家里没有酒窖的酒鬼。

        10.好了，好了，先生，但愿你一点没有受伤！请过来，拔掉软木塞，倾倒那个热水瓶；不过，一旦你那了不得的脚拇指让你咆哮起来，那可与我真是毫不相干。如果绅士们都喜欢这种蹭痒游戏，对小镇水泵来说，也没什么！这条干渴至极的狗，它红红的舌头耷拉外面，它并不厌恶我的殷勤好客。此时，它倚着后腿立起，急切地拍打水槽里流出的水，看呀，它那么快乐地再次雀跃跑开！好一条大颌狗！你的拜神仪式中竟然还有这等乐趣？

        11.请你们原谅，好心的人。我得打断一下我的连珠妙语。我得赶紧喷水，眼见水槽里的水快要见底了。那个赶车的人走过来了，牵着他的双轭牛车，也许从斯坦顿或其他什么地方一路匆匆赶来。没有什么事情能比我能为畜群提供饮水更开心。看！水槽两边的水位标降得多快，直到它们个个喝得肚鼓腰圆，不时地打上几声响嚏，发出快乐的喘息！好了，它们此刻正安详地望着各自鼓胀的胃囊。牛们，你们才是真正的豪饮者。

        12.我自认是这一时代了不起的改革家。一股股清澈水流汹涌喷泻，源源不断地来自静寂的泉眼深处，从我的喷嘴或姑且算作的喷嘴里流出，势必涤荡这个世界上大多罪恶与痛苦。在这一辉煌的事业中，奶牛正是我伟大的同盟军，给力！牛奶，还有水！

        13.唉! 尤其对那些初出茅庐的演说者，口干舌燥、滔滔不绝的演说，难免不是高谈阔论。直到现在我才意识到，由于我的缘故，那些演说家的节制颇为痛苦。那位好心的基督徒，压住水泵猛地揿按一两下，不过才弄湿我的鼻子。谢谢你，先生，请继续压呀，别松手。



              14.小镇水泵和奶牛不愧光荣的联手，上帝保佑的终极完美，最终势必占据试图消除干渴的世界垄断领域！这一上帝佑福的终极完美！整个世界上，贫穷将不复存在。不会有遮蔽自身污秽的悲惨鄙陋。因此，受害者从此锐减，疾病不再猖獗蔓延。至于罪恶，如果不能完全泯灭，亦会苟存不多。

        15.那时，将不会有家庭战争，夫妻一起静静享受岁月姝好，手牵手地走过温馨一生，面对死亡无怨无悔，直到绵延温情戛然而止。在他们眼里，不曾有疯子癫狂梦魇的体验，亦不会有酒鬼谵妄错乱后的悔意不迭。那种记忆与希冀的微笑难以消逝，曾经以及未来爱恋的精神契合将在他们的脸上自然浮现。

        16.喝吧，接下来你会焕然一新！水，那么纯净透凉，何时才能平息杀戮者的嗜血疯狂？泉水淙淙，从苍劲古老的粗干虬枝下奔涌流出，尽管大漠荒烟里历史珍宝仍深藏在炽热岩浆中。那里天远地阔，没有遮蔽，唯有现代文明的阴翳庇护，那才是人类康健和平乃至幸福的源泉。我确信它的到来，快乐地翘首以待。从耶稣诞生之日起，那曾经过于低估、清澈之水的种种美德，将会获得我们的充分评价与再度认知。

GOOD NIGHT


        晚 安

        Samuel Griswold Goodrich (b. 1793, d. 1860) was born in Ridgefield, Conn. Mr. Goodrich is best known as “Peter Parley,” under which assumed name he commenced the publication of a series of Juvenile works about 1827. He edited “Parley’s Magazine” from 1841 to 1854. He was appointed United States consul for Paris in 1848, and held that office four years. He was a voluminous writer, and his works are interesting and popular. His “Recollections of a Lifetime” was published in 1857, and “Peter Parley’s Own Story” the year after his death.





        1. The sun has sunk behind the hills,

        The shadows o’er the landscape creep;

        A drowsy sound the woodland fills,

        As nature folds her arms to sleep:

         Good night—good night.





        2. The chattering jay has ceased his din,

        The noisy robin sings no more;

        The crow, his mountain haunt within,

        Dreams ’mid the forest’s surly roar:

         Good night—good night.





        3. The sunlit cloud floats dim and pale;

        The dew is falling soft and still,

        The mist hangs trembling o’er the vale,

        And silence broods o’er yonder mill:

         Good night—good night.





        4. The rose, so ruddy in the light,

        Bends on its stem all rayless now;

        And by its side a lily white,

        A sister shadow, seems to bow:

         Good night—good night.





        5. The bat may wheel on silent wing,

        The fox his guilty vigils keep,

        The boding owl his dirges sing;

        But love and innocence will sleep:

         Good night—good night.

        LESSON 31





AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL


        刻板守旧的姑娘

        Louisa May Alcott (b. 1833, d. 1888) was born at Germantown, Pa., of New England parentage. Her parents afterwards returned to New England, and most of her life was spent in Concord, Mass. During the Civil War she went to Washington and nursed the wounded and sick until her own health gave way. As a child she used to write stories for the amusement of her playmates, and in 1857 published her first book, “Flower Fables.” Her first novel, “Moods,” appeared in 1865. “Little Women,” published in 1868, is a picture of her own home life. “An Old Fashioned Girl,” from which this extract is adapted, was published in 1870, and is one of her most popular books.





        1. Polly hoped the “dreadful boy” (Tom) would not be present; but he was, and stared at her all dinner time in a most trying manner.

        2. Mr. Shaw, a busy-looking gentleman, said, “How do you do, my dear? Hope you’ll enjoy yourself;” and then appeared to forget her entirely. Mrs. Shaw, a pale, nervous woman, greeted her little guest kindly, and took care that she wanted for nothing.

        3. Madam Shaw, a quiet old lady, with an imposing[1] cap, exclaimed, on seeing Polly, “Bless my heart! the image of her mother—a sweet woman—how is she, dear?” and kept peering at the newcomer over her glasses till, between Madam and Tom, poor Polly lost her appetite.

        4. Her cousin Fanny chatted like a magpie[2], and little Maud fidgeted, till Tom proposed to put her under the big dish cover, which produced such an explosion that the young lady was borne screaming away by the much-enduring nurse.

        5. It was, altogether, an uncomfortable dinner, and Polly was very glad when it was over. They all went about their own affairs; and, after doing the honors of the house, Fan was called to the dressmaker, leaving Polly to amuse herself in the great drawing-room.

        6. Polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes; and, having examined all the pretty things about her, began to walk up and down over the soft, flowery carpet, humming to herself, as the daylight faded, and only the ruddy glow of the fire filled the room.

        7. Presently Madam came slowly in, and sat down in her armchair, saying, “That’s a fine old tune; sing it to me, my dear. I have n’t heard it this many a day.”

        8. Polly didn’t like to sing before strangers, for she had no teaching but such as her busy mother could give her; but she had been taught the utmost respect for old people, and, having no reason for refusing, she directly went to the piano and did as she was bid.

        9. “That’s the sort of music it’s a pleasure to hear. Sing some more, dear,” said Madam, in her gentle way, when she had done.

        10. Pleased with this praise, Polly sang away in a fresh little voice that went straight to the listener’s heart and nestled there. The sweet old tunes that one is never tired of were all Polly’s store. The more she sung, the better she did it; and when she wound up with “A Health to King Charlie,” the room quite rung with the stirring music made by the big piano and the little maid.



              11. “That’s a jolly tune! Sing it again, please,” cried Tom’s voice; and there was Tom’s red head bobbing up over the high back of the chair where he had hidden himself.

        12. It gave Polly quite a turn, for she thought no one was hearing her but the old lady dozing by the fire. “I can’t sing any more; I’m tired,” she said, and walked away to Madam in the other room. The red head vanished [3]like a meteor[4], for Polly’s tone had been decidedly cool.

        13. The old lady put out her hand, and, drawing Polly to her knee, looked into her face with such kind eyes that Polly forgot the impressive cap, and smiled at her confidently[5]; for she saw that her simple music had pleased her listener, and she felt glad to know it.

        14. “You mus’n’t mind my staring, dear,” said Madam, softly pinching her rosy cheek, “I haven’t seen a little girl for so long, it does my old eyes good to look at you.” Polly thought that a very odd speech, and could n’t help saying, “Are n’t Fan and Maud little girls, too?”

        15. “Oh, dear, no! not what I call little girls. Fan has been a young lady this two years, and Maud is a spoiled baby. Your mother’s a very sensible woman, my child.”

        16. “What a queer old lady!” thought Polly; but she said “Yes’m,” respectfully, and looked at the fire. “You don’t understand what I mean, do you?” asked Madam, still holding her by the chin. “No’m; not quite.”

        17. “Well, dear, I’ll tell you. In my day, children of fourteen and fifteen did n’t dress in the height of the fashion; go to parties as nearly like those of grown people as it’s possible to make them; lead idle, giddy, unhealthy lives, and get blase’[6] at twenty. We were little folks till eighteen or so; worked and studied, dressed and played, like children; honored our parents; and our days were much longer in the land than now, it seems to me.”

        18. The old lady appeared to forget Polly, at the end of her speech; for she sat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own, and looking up at a faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt and a queue. “Was he your father, Madam?”

        19. “Yes, my dear; my honored father. I did up his frills to the day of his death; and the first money I ever earned, was five dollars which he offered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the handsomest darn in his silk stockings.”

        20. “How proud you must have been!” cried Polly, leaning on the old lady’s knee with an interested face.

        21. “Yes; and we all learned to make bread, and cook, and wore little chintz gowns, and were as gay and hearty as kittens. All lived to be grandmothers; and I’m the last—seventy next birthday, my dear, and not worn out yet; though daughter Shaw is an invalid[7] at forty.”

        22. “That’s the way I was brought up, and that’s why Fan calls me old-fashioned, I suppose. Tell more about your papa, please; I like it,” said Polly.



              23. “Say, ‘father.’ We never called him papa; and if one of my brothers had addressed him as ‘governor,’ as boys now do, I really think he’d have him cut off with a shilling.”

        1．波莉但愿那个讨厌的男孩（汤姆）不会来，可他偏在，更可恶的是，他那惹人生烦的眼睛直直地盯着她，整整一餐饭，没闪过眼。

        2．肖先生说，“你好，亲爱的，希望你在这里玩得开心。”他似乎忙得不可开交，接下来，好像完全忘了她的存在。面色苍白的肖太太，神情有点紧张，问候了她的小客人后，便再也没有招呼她。

        3．年迈的肖老夫人，言语不多，头上戴着颇为夸张的帽子，一见波莉，就大呼小叫起来，“我的天哪！好家伙！简直和你妈一个模子刻出来的，你妈可真是个大美人，她还好吗？我的孩子。”老太太边说，边从眼镜上端辨认才到的客人，侧身躲过肖太太和汤姆挡住来客的视线。可怜的波莉觉得索然无趣。

        4．波莉堂姐范妮叽喳起来没完没了，旁边的小穆德烦躁地坐立不安。汤姆对她说，那我把你放到那个大号菜盘盖子下，没想到，居然让过来掀锅盖的一位年轻女子尖叫着跑开，这种把戏实在超出了她的心理承受能力。

        5．总而言之，那次经历有点令人难忘，一俟晚餐结束，波莉如释重负地喘气，顿时开心起来。大家各忙各的散去了，尽过地主之谊后，范妮被叫到裁缝那里去了，偌大的客厅里，只留波莉独自一人玩耍。

        6．波莉感觉很爽，没人叨扰自己。将周围好玩的杂七杂八瞅完后，波莉在客厅那块松软的花地毯上走来走去，嘴里不停地哼唱着。白天正在退去，火苗的红润光亮在整个房间弥漫开来。

        7． 不一会，肖老夫人步履迟缓地走进客厅，在摇椅上坐下，她对波莉说，“这是一只很老的曲子，很好听，给我唱唱，亲爱的，我可是很久没听过这首歌了。”





              8．在生人面前开口让波莉感到很是别扭，波莉从未受过什么正规教育，除了从整天忙碌的妈妈那得到些家常教诲；长者最应该获得尊重，这种道理她倒是清楚，看来没有任何理由拒绝，于是，她径直走到钢琴边，按老人的吩咐唱了起来。



        9．波莉唱完，老夫人轻声地说，“就是这首歌，真的不错。再来一遍吧，亲爱的。”

        10．听到老夫人的赞扬，波莉心里感觉挺受用。再次开口时，她的歌声愈加清新柔婉，悠悠然荡漾开来。百听不厌、经典甜美的老歌从来都是波莉的拿手好戏。她越唱越发投入，一曲《祝查理国王健康》达到高亢，整个房间弥漫着钢琴叮当交响与小姑娘的美妙歌声。

        11．“这曲子太好听了！再唱一遍，好吗？”汤姆冷不丁冒了出来。他的红头发突然出现在高椅后面，没想到，他竟藏在那里。

        12．波莉心猛然一惊，她原以为，客厅里只有那位老太太，在火炉边打盹，不会有别人，“不唱了，我累了。”说完，她迅速躲开汤姆，走向房间那头的老太太。红头发汤姆即刻流星般消失了，毕竟，波莉话里有不容置疑的冷淡。

        13．老太太伸出手，把波莉拉到她的身边，满眼慈祥地望着她，此刻的波莉早已忘记老人头上那顶讨厌的帽子，看着老太太笑了起来，心里不再感到怯意。她很清楚，她的听众对自己的歌声饶有兴趣，想到这里，她觉得很开心。

        14．“千万别介意我这样看着你，亲爱的，”老人轻轻捏了捏小姑娘粉红色的脸颊，“我很长时间没和小姑娘这样说话了，成天老眼昏花的，看到你，我也神清气爽了。”波莉听到这些，心里纳闷，禁不住问道：“范妮还有穆德，难道不也是小姑娘吗？”

        15. “哦，不，孩子，那可不是我说的小姑娘，范妮这两年长大了，变成大姑娘了，穆德实在是被宠坏了。你妈妈真是明晓事理，我的孩子。”

        16．“老太太够古怪的！”波莉心想。“是的，夫人，”她嘴上只管附和老太太，眼睛却盯着炉中火苗。“你难道不明白我的意思吗？”老太太问道，手还轻轻捏了一下波莉下巴。“是的，好像不太明白。”

        17．“好的，孩子，我来告诉你。在我们那个年代，14—15岁的姑娘不会穿现在的时尚短裙，也不会穿类似成人的服装去参加各种聚会，如果那样装扮，看起来就会让人感觉游手好闲，轻佻浅薄，甚至生活不正常。等到二十岁左右，你自己也会玩腻的。18岁之前，我们不过都是些小毛孩子，整天就是拼命读书学习，穿衣打扮得像正经家庭的孩子，这要尊敬父母长辈，与现在相比，那时日子舒坦实在得多，至少对我来说是这样。”



              18．说话末了，老太太似乎忘了波莉，她坐在那里，忘神地轻轻拍着握在她手里那只丰润的小手，然后抬头看了看泛黄的相片，相片中老先生穿着衬衫，头上系根发辫，衣服有点皱巴巴的。“这是你父亲吗？夫人？”

        19．“是的，亲爱的，那就是我可爱的父亲。我一直给父亲整理衣物，直到他离开人世。记得我第一次挣的五美元，就是他给他六个女儿定的规矩，谁的织补活最好，谁就得到那次奖励。”

        20.“你一定非常自豪！”波莉叫了起来，她倚靠在老太太的膝头，饶有兴趣地看着老人。

        21．“你说得不错，我们六姐妹都学会了做面包，烧饭，从小就穿粗布衣衫，整天活泼健康的，像一群活蹦乱跳的猫仔。如今，我们姐妹六个都当上奶奶了，我最小，明年就七十岁了，孩子，我这身子骨还结实着呢，可我的女儿肖才四十岁上下，身体就不中用了。”

        22．“那就是我接受的教育方式，我想，也就是范妮为什么总是叫我老古董。再说说你的爸爸，求你了，我喜欢听。”波莉说。

        23．“我们从不叫他‘爸爸’，只称呼他‘父亲’，如果我的兄弟中有人撒娇地叫他‘老爸’，就像眼下孩子们习惯那样，父亲肯定会用一先令剥夺他的实际财产继承权，这一点，我从不怀疑。”





        LESSON 32





MY MOTHER’S HANDS


        妈妈的双手

         1. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!

         They’re neither white nor small;

         And you, I know, would scarcely think

         That they are fair at all.

         I’ve looked on hands whose form and hue

         A sculptor’s dream might be;

         Yet are those aged, wrinkled hands

         More beautiful to me.





         2. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!

         Though heart were weary and sad,

         Those patient hands kept toiling on,

         That the children might be glad.

         I always weep, as, looking back

         To childhood’s distant day,

         I think how those hands rested not

         When mine were at their play.





         3. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!

         They’re growing feeble now,

         For time and pain have left their mark

         On hands and heart and brow.

         Alas! alas! the nearing time,

         And the sad, sad day to me,

         When ’neath the daisies, out of sight,

         These hands will folded be.





         4. But oh! beyond this shadow land,

         Where all is bright and fair,

         I know full well these dear old hands

         Will palms of victory bear;

         Where crystal streams through endless years

         Flow over golden sands,

         And where the old grow young again,

        I’ll clasp my mother’s hands.

        1．如此美丽的双手！

        不白，也不娇小，

        我知道，你很少想到，

        你的手，叙述朴实无华之道。

        我端详，那手的形态色泽，

        或许激起，雕塑家艺术灵感，

        尽管，干枯羸弱皱纹满布，

        只需一眼，就将我彻底击倒。





        2．如此美丽的双手！

        虽然，心里盛满疲惫哀伤，

        每天渴望，孩子们醉心微笑，

        日夜操劳，忍受生活的痛楚，

        时常回首，我总会无声恸哭，

        一幕幕，那煎熬的锥心刺骨，

        当年我，尽情地奔跑玩耍，

        从未想到，妈妈的千辛万苦。





        3．如此美丽的双手！

        那双手， 衰老已不堪入目，

        逝水流年，留下岁月屐痕，

        亲情难舍，远去的晨钟暮鼓，

        唉！越来越近的最后撒手，

        我的心，那么悲痛欲绝，

        雏菊花下，消失了你佝偻身影，

        所有思念，竟敌不过一抔黄土。





        4． 哦， 越过死亡阴影，

        抵达最后的光明彼岸，

        我感叹，那苍老怜爱的双手，

        掬起母亲，一生的悲欢离愁；

        人世间， 那个于我最特别的人，

        流泻出，母性的庸常感动，

        恍惚中，倏然穿越漫长时光，

        我依然，紧紧扣住母亲的双手。





        LESSON 33





THE DISCONTENTED PENDULUM


        不满意的钟摆

        Jane Taylor (b. 1783, d. 1824) was born in London. Her mother was a writer of some note. In connection with her sister Ann, Jane Taylor wrote several juvenile works of more than ordinary excellence. Among them were “Hymns for Infant Minds” and “Original Poems.” Besides these, she wrote “Display, a Tale,” “Essays in Rhyme,” and “Contributions of QQ.” Her writings are graceful, and often contain a useful moral.





        1. An old clock that had stood for fifty years in a farmer’s kitchen, without giving its owner any cause of complaint, early one summer’s morning, before the family was stirring, suddenly stopped. Upon this, the dial plate (if we may credit the fable) changed countenance with alarm; the hands made a vain effort to continue their course; the wheels remained motionless with surprise; the weights hung speechless; and each member felt disposed to lay the blame on the others. At length the dial instituted[1] a formal inquiry as to the cause of the stagnation, when hands, wheels, weights, with one voice, protested[2] their innocence.

        2. But now a faint tick was heard below from the pendulum, who spoke thus: “I confess myself to be the sole cause of the present stoppage; and I am willing, for the general satisfaction, to assign my reasons. The truth is, that I am tired of ticking.” Upon hearing this, the old clock became so enraged that it was upon the very point of striking. “Lazy wire!” exclaimed the dial plate, holding up its bands.

        3. “Very good!” replied the pendulum; “it is vastly easy for you, Mistress Dial, who have always, as everybody knows, set yourself up above me,—it is vastly easy for you, I say, to accuse other people of laziness! you who have had nothing to do all your life but to stare people in the face, and to amuse yourself with watching all that goes on in the kitchen. Think, I beseech you, how you would like to be shut up for life in this dark closet, and to wag backward and forward year after year, as I do.”

        4. “As to that,” said the dial, “is there not a window in your house on purpose for you to look through?” “For all that,” resumed the pendulum, “it is very dark here; and, although there is a window, I dare not stop even for an instant to look out at it. Besides, I am really tired of my way of life; and, if you wish, I’ll tell you how I took this disgust at my employment. I happened, this morning, to be calculating[3] how many times I should have to tick in the course of only the next twenty-four hours; perhaps some one of you above there can give me the exact sum.”

        5. The minute hand, being quick at figures, presently replied, “Eighty-six thousand four hundred times.” “Exactly so,” replied the pendulum. “Well, I appeal to you all, if the very thought of this was not enough to fatigue anyone; and when I began to multiply the strokes of one day by those of months and years, really it was no wonder if I felt discouraged at the prospect[4]. So, after a great deal of reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to myself, I’ll stop.”



              6. The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this harangue[5]; but, resuming its gravity, thus replied: “Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really astonished that such a useful, industrious person as yourself should have been seized by this sudden weariness. It is true, you have done a great deal of work in your time; so have we all, and are likely to do; which, although it may fatigue us to think of, the question is, whether it will fatigue us to do. Would you now do me the favor to give about half a dozen strokes to illustrate[6] my argument?”

        7. The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its usual pace. “Now,” resumed the dial, “may I be allowed to inquire if that exertion[7] is at all fatiguing or disagreeable to you?” “Not in the least,” replied the pendulum; “it is not of six strokes that I complain, nor of sixty, but of millions.”

        8. “Very good,” replied the dial; “but recollect that, although you may think of a million of strokes in an instant, you are required to execute[8] but one; and that, however often you may hereafter have to swing, a moment will always be given you to swing in.” “That consideration[9] staggers me, I confess,” said the pendulum. “Then I hope,” resumed the dial plate, “that we shall all return to our duty immediately; for the maids will be in bed if we stand idling thus.”

        9. Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused of light conduct, used all their influence in urging him to proceed; when, as if with one consent, the wheels began to turn, the hands began to move, the pendulum began to swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a red beam of the rising sun, that streamed through a hole in the kitchen, shining full upon the dial plate, it brightened up as if nothing had been the matter.

        10. When the farmer came down to breakfast that morning, upon looking at the clock, he declared that his watch had gained half an hour in the night.

              1．农夫厨房里，立着一座半世纪之久的老钟，老钟从未向主人抱怨过什么。一年夏天，黎明时分，农夫全家起床的喧哗之前，钟突然停了。钟刚停，惊诧不已的钟的表盘（我们不妨认为这不过是个寓言）马上拉长了脸，钟的指针打算循原有路程迈步，却发现不过徒劳枉然；齿轮此刻也惊讶地静止不动；这边刻度量衡高高挂着，一声不吭。每位成员都想将过错归咎于他人，最终，表盘实施正规盘查，以求查明老钟停止的缘由，与此同时，时针、齿轮以及刻度量衡异口同声地表明自己的无辜清白。

        2．就在那时，钟摆下方传来极为微弱的一声滴答，那声音说道，“我主动坦白，我是钟表停止的唯一原因，考虑到在座各位，我愿意陈述自己的理由。原因很简单，我实在厌倦了滴答。”听到这话，又恰逢敲钟的节骨眼上，老钟顿时怒火中烧。“好一个懒惰钟摆！”表盘也大声叫着，同时扬起表盘嵌条。

        3．“太妙了！”钟摆反讥道，“对你来说，说说总是再容易不过，表盘夫人，大家看得都很清楚，究竟谁总是凌驾在我的头上？我要说的是，你总是指责别人懒惰！这点对你来说，简直太过容易。你一生无所事事，除了瞪眼看着别人的脸，厨房里发生的大小事情你只会袖手旁观，围观为乐。我请你想想，如果年复一年地像我这样不停地左摇右摆，你是否乐意被关在这黑暗笼子里度过一生？”

        4．“说到这一点，”表盘说，“难道不是特意为你安了个窗口，让你可以看到外面？”“那就索性说清楚吧，” 钟摆接着说，“虽然开了个窗口，这里可太黑了，我甚至不敢停顿片刻向外张望，再说，我实在厌倦了这种生活方式；如果你不计较的话，那我不妨说说，我对这份工作实在过于厌恶。今天早晨，我碰巧算了一下，接下来一天24小时内，我需要滴答多少次呀，你们上面诸位或许能给我报个准确数字。”

        5．擅长计算的分钟随即回答：“86400次。”“一点不错，”钟摆说，“那么，我希望大家注意，假若仅仅这点还不能使任何人疲惫至极，如果再将每天每月每年的数字翻倍累计，我对前途感到沮丧失望，感到累得无处可逃，这，难道还有什么奇怪吗？考虑到这些理由，犹豫再三，经过反复琢磨，我决定罢工。”

        6．钟摆诉苦时，表盘几乎无法保持它的沉稳表情，稍微定神恢复常态后，表盘开口了，“亲爱的钟摆先生，像你这样勤勉能干的人，竟然被突如其来的疲惫压垮，让人匪夷所思。在你任职期间，你的确做了大量工作，难道在座诸位不亦拼命干活？工作不亦将继续如此？尽管想到这点，我们或许都疲惫不堪，问题在于，继续做下去难道使我们疲惫不堪？你能否帮我个忙，再摆动滴答六七下，以证明我所言不虚？”



              7．按照正常的节奏，钟摆顺从地滴答了六次。“好了，”表盘接着说，“可否允许我向你提个问题？说到底，这样干活让你生烦讨厌？”“一点也不，”钟摆回答，“我抱怨的不是滴答六次，不是六十次，而是数以百万计的六次。”

        8．“很好，”表盘说道，“不过，你想一下，虽然，你或许考虑顷刻间需要一百万次滴答，其实你实施的唯有最初的一次，因为接下来，往往无论你摇摆多少，你的感觉总是滴答不停。”“一想到这点，我就眩晕得不行，我承认。”钟摆说。“那么，我希望，”表盘接着说，“我们大家立即各就各位，女仆们马上就该起床了，我们还在这无所事事地闲聊。”

        9．听到这话，从未有人指责自己工作轻巧的刻度量衡，纷纷竭尽全力地劝说钟摆继续干活，末了，大家看来意见达到统一，于是，齿轮们转动起来，时钟们开始踱步，钟摆也进入摇摆状态。为证实自己信用如一，钟摆滴答声与以前同样铿锵有力。初升太阳的光线，从厨房上的一处洞口流泻下来，红色阳光落满表盘的脸庞，表盘眉眼熠熠生辉，好像刚才什么事都不曾发生过。

        10．那天早晨，那位农夫走进厨房吃早饭，抬头看了看钟说，他的表，昨晚快了半小时。





        LESSON 34





THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS


        花朵的死亡

        William Cullen Bryant (b. 1794, d. 1878) was born in Cummington, Mass. He entered Williams College at the age of sixteen, but was honorably dismissed at the end of two years. At the age of twenty-one he was admitted to the bar, and practiced his profession successfully for nine years. In 1826 he removed to New York, and became connected with the “Evening Post”—a connection which continued to the time of his death. His residence for more than thirty of the last years of his life was at Roslyn, Long Island. He visited Europe several times; and in 1849 he continued his travels into Egypt and Syria.

        In all his poems, Mr. Bryant exhibits a remarkable love for, and a careful study of, nature. His language, both in prose and verse, is always chaste, correct, and elegant. “Thanatopsis,” perhaps the best known of all his poems, was written when he was but nineteen. His excellent translations of the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey” of Homer and some of his best poems, were written after he had passed the age of seventy. He retained his powers and his activity till the close of his life.





         1. The melancholy days are come,

         The saddest of the year,

         Of wailing[10] winds, and naked woods,

         And meadows brown and sear[11].

         Heaped in the hollows of the grove

         The autumn leaves lie dead;

         They rustle to the eddying gust,

         And to the rabbit’s tread.

         The robin and the wren are flown,

         And from the shrubs the jay,

         And from the wood top calls the crow

         Through all the gloomy day.





         2. Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers,

         That lately sprang and stood

         In brighter light and softer airs,

         A beauteous sisterhood?

         Alas! they all are in their graves;

         The gentle race of flowers

         Are lying in their lowly beds

         With the fair and good of ours.

         The rain is falling where they lie;



               But the cold November rain

         Calls not from out the gloomy earth

         The lovely ones again.





         3. The windflower and the violet,

         They perished long ago,

         And the brier rose and the orchis died

         Amid the summer’s glow;

         But on the hill, the golden-rod,

         And the aster in the wood,

         And the yellow sunflower by the brook,

         In autumn beauty stood,

         Till fell the frost from the clear, cold heaven,

         As falls the plague on men,

         And the brightness of their smile was gone

         From upland, glade[12], and glen[13],





         4. And now, when comes the calm, mild day,

         As still such days will come,

         To call the squirrel and the bee

         From out their winter home;

         When the sound of dropping nuts is heard,

         Though all the trees are still,

         And twinkle in the smoky light

         The waters of the rill,

         The south wind searches for the flowers

         Whose fragrance late he bore,

         And sighs to find them in the wood

         And by the stream no more.





         5. And then I think of one, who in

         Her youthful beauty died,

         The fair, meek blossom that grew up

         And faded by my side.

         In the cold, moist earth we laid her,

         When the forest cast the leaf,

         And we wept that one so lovely

         Should have a life so brief;

         Yet not unmeet[14] it was that one,

         Like that young friend of ours,

         So gentle and so beautiful,

         Should perish with the flowers.

        1. 那些， 忧郁悲伤的日子来了，

        年复一年， 最为痛苦难捱，

        风在哀哭， 掠过光秃裸露的丛林，

        炙热尽舔，枯萎成片的草原，

        昔日绿意盈盈， 已经完成宿命，

        拥挤成团， 飘落在沟壑低洼，

        萧瑟秋风，卷起漫天尘土，

        不时遮住， 狡兔三窟巢穴，

        惊飞一群群，知更鸟鹪鹩。

        灌木林中，觅食栖息的松鸦，

        还有树梢上，戛然而止鸦阵，

        天空晦暗，阴冷列队飞来。





        2. 那些，美丽的花朵哪里去了？

        转眼间，不见了风中摇曳，

        明晃晃艳阳，微风和煦，

        呼朋唤友，千姿百媚地涌来。

        唉呀！纷纷扬扬的嫣红，

        悄然铺成，黑色连绵的花冢，

        卑微的花瓣们，匍匐在地，

        卷走人世间赞美祝福。

        雨声淅沥，扑打凋零的容颜，

        凄风冷雨，再亦难唤回

        从前，婀娜多姿的身影，

        沧浪那边，推不开鬼魅深重。





              3. 银莲花，还有紫罗兰，

        恍惚中，它们已离开很久，

        野蔷薇，玫瑰，红门兰，

        死在，骄阳如火的热烈。

        山路蜿蜒，金色的快乐枝条，

        森林里，笑容洋溢的紫菀，

        溪水边，明黄色向日葵，

        涂抹出，秋天的寥廓浪漫。

        严霜，很快搅起周天寒彻，

        犹如，世间肆虐的瘟疫，

        裹走了，那些欢歌笑语，

        寒风呼啸，魂魄从此飘散。





        4. 万物复苏，大地苏醒回暖，

        微风吹拂，阳光又现人间。

        春姑娘脚步，轻声呼唤，

        走出巢穴，冬眠者不再梦酣。

        每棵树木，伫立冬天的沉思，

        万籁静寂，松果落地的铮然，

        河水蜿蜒，流淌出潺潺快意，

        星光闪烁，烟波浩渺的水面。

        春风呵，你追着千花万朵寻来，

        哪一缕芬芳，寄寓内心企盼？

        长吁短叹，那清香竟来自灌丛，

        幽静河畔，花的踪迹早已杳然。





        5. 我想起，那位清纯少女，

        青春靓丽，尚未绽放的花蕾，

        亭亭玉立，羞赧迷人的笑脸，

        旋即枯萎，凋谢在我的身边。

        亲手将她葬进，冰冷潮湿的墓地，

        落叶为穹，无限惆怅倍添，

        长泣而痛，为何美丽短暂？

        红销香断，难道天妒红颜？

        青山逶迤，远走了你的笑容，

        绿水悠悠，流去了你的温柔，

        一缕相思，今朝无从寻觅，

        陌上花开，来年何以寄愁？





        LESSON 35





THE THUNDERSTORM


        暴 风 雨

        Washington Irving (b. 1783, d. 1859). This distinguished author, whose works have enriched American literature, was born in the city of New York. He had an ordinary school education, and began his literary career at the age of nineteen, by writing for a paper published by his brother. His first book, “Salmagundi,” was published in 1807. Two years later he published “Knickerbocker’s History of New York.” In 1815 he sailed for Europe, and remained abroad seventeen years, during which time he wrote several of his works. From 1842 to 1846 he was minister to Spain. The last years of his life were passed at “Sunnyside,” near Tarrytown, N.Y. He was never married. “The Life of Washington,” his last work, was completed in the same year in which he died. Mr. Irving’s works are characterized by humor, chaste sentiment, and elegance and correctness of expression. The following selection is from “Dolph” in “Bracehridge Hall.”





        1. In the second day of the voyage, they came to the Highlands. It was the latter part of a calm, sultry day, that they floated gently with the tide between these stern mountains. There was that perfect quiet which prevails over nature in the languor[15] of summer heat. The turning of a plank, or the accidental falling of an oar, on deck, was echoed from the mountain side and reverberated along the shores; and, if by chance the captain gave a shout of command, there were airy tongues that mocked it from every cliff.

        2. Dolph gazed about him, in mute delight and wonder, at these scenes of nature’s magnificence. To the left, the Dunderberg reared its woody precipices, height over height, forest over forest, away into the deep summer sky. To the right, strutted forth the bold promontory of Antony’s Nose, with a solitary eagle wheeling about it; while beyond, mountain succeeded to mountain, until they seemed to lock their arms together and confine this mighty rive in their embraces.

        3. In the midst of this admiration, Dolph remarked[16] a pile of bright, snowy clouds peering above the western heights. It was succeeded by another, and another, each seemingly pushing onward its predecessor[17], and towering, with dazzling brilliancy, in the deep blue atmosphere; and now muttering peals of thunder were faintly heard rolling behind the mountains. The river, hitherto still and glassy, reflecting pictures of the sky and land, now showed a dark ripple at a distance, as the wind came creeping up it. The fishhawks wheeled and screamed, and sought their nests on the high, dry trees; the crows flew clamorously[18] to the crevices of the rocks; and all nature seemed conscious of the approaching thunder gust.



              4. The clouds now rolled in volumes over the mountain tops; their summits still bright and snowy, but the lower parts of an inky blackness. The rain began to patter down in broad and scattered drops; the wind freshened, and curled up the waves; at length, it seemed as if the bellying[19] clouds were torn open by the mountain tops, and complete torrents of rain came rattling down. The lightning leaped from cloud to cloud, and streamed quivering against the rocks, splitting and rending the stoutest forest trees. The thunder burst in tremendous explosions; the peals were echoed from mountain to mountain; they crashed upon Dunderberg, and then rolled up the long defile[20] of the Highlands, each headland making a new echo, until old Bull Hill seemed to bellow back the storm.

        5. For a time the scudding rack[21] and mist and the sheeted rain almost hid the landscape from the sight. There was a fearful gloom, illumined still more fearfully by the streams of lightning which glittered among the raindrops. Never had Dolph beheld such an absolute warring of the elements[22]; it seemed as if the storm was tearing and rending its way through the mountain defile, and had brought all the artillery of heaven into action.

        1．旅途第二天，他们抵达苏格兰高地。当时天近傍晚，无风、闷热。船儿顺流轻轻漂流，两岸森严的崇山峻岭绵亘延伸。天地陷入浓重的静谧。夏日无精打采，似乎耗尽了最后一缕炎热。船舷时而偏转，甲板上木浆偶然落水，哪怕一点细微声音，撞击山体后旋即沿山涧两岸依次荡开。如果碰巧船长扯开嗓子吆喝一声，四周峭壁很快炸响一连串滚动訇然。

        2．道尔夫出神地看着周遭如同淹没在远古洪荒中的自然奇观，内心满是无言的快乐，还有好奇。从左舷看，此刻，“邓德伯格号”船高竖前舷，径直冲过层层前方陡峭，飞快掠过两岸浓密丛林，进入更为幽深的夏日空寂。从右舷看，舷体凸出一块木牌，外形有点像安东尼的粗硕鼻子，木牌上刻有一只孤独的鹰，那只鹰正在快速不停地旋转。放眼望去，只见沿岸山峦叠嶂不断后退，最后，好像山穷水复疑无路，群峰兀立，头顶上唯有一道狭长蓝天。



              3．道尔夫忙着观幽探奇，突然看到一簇明晃晃的银色云团，在西方天际若隐若现，随后，又飘过来一簇云团，又涌来一团，不断叠现翻滚的云团逐次相推，直冲九天云汉，亦愈发炫目耀眼，背景天空现出阴晦的深蓝。倏尔，沉闷的雷声依稀裹杂响起，从山那边滚翻冒出。河水，恍然不知，一如既往地娴静；满目山川景色，在澄明如镜的一袭水面现出清晰倒影。很快，似乎闻到风的潜行气息，远处水域翻起黑色波浪。水面上，鱼鹰急速地盘旋尖叫，到处寻觅筑在山崖枯树上的鸟巢；乌鸦鼓噪地飞向峭崖绝壁的石隙里；自然万物无不惊悚，一场暴风雨顷刻来临。

        4．云层翻卷滚过道道山峦，峰顶明晃晃地刺眼，峰峦下端黢黑模糊连成一片。雨滴噼里啪啦地落下，溅起大朵水珠，风，愈发清新，腾起高耸连天的浪花，然后，不断隆升的云层仿佛被山尖猛地撕开，暴雨哗哗如注，搅动漫天倾盆。闪电从一朵云旋即跳到另一朵云上，它们锐利的触角颤抖着撞向四处岩壁，猛力撕扯劈开那些粗硕高大的树木。震耳欲聋的雷声不时炸开，悬崖绝壁上的訇声雷裂渐次放大，在峰回水转中迸发一串串巨响。轰鸣滚滚，扑打“邓德伯格号”船舷，然后越过半空苏格兰高地的狭长山谷，每逢凸崖，势必炸开新一轮力拔千钧，直到老牛山不停地哞哞吼叫，将暴风骤雨发狂地撵开。

        5．黑云催天压地，碎云疾驰穿梭，片状雨滴如泄似注从天而下，天地间几乎看不见手掌，周围一片可怕的混沌阴暗。刹那间，接二连三的闪电穿过雨点，迸出一道道刺目光亮，那么瘆人惨白、狰狞可怖。道尔夫从未目睹过如此怪异纷呈的天象，似乎暴风骤雨慌不择路，欲冲破山涧中那条峡谷，愣是凶猛异常地撕开一条血路。天上雷公电母前来相助，调遣麾下所有的天兵天将，将箭矢枪炮一应辎重悉数投入了战斗。





        LESSON 36





APRIL DAY


        四月的日子

        Caroline Anne Southey (b. 1786, d.1854), the second wife of Southey the poet, and better known as Caroline Bowles, was born near Lymington, Hampshire, England. Her first work, “Ellen Fitzarthur,” a poem, was published in 1820; and for more than twenty years her writings were published anonymously. In 1839 she was married to Mr. Southey, and survived him over ten years. Her poetry is graceful in expression, and full of tenderness, though somewhat melancholy. The following extract first appeared in 1822 in a collection entitled, “The Widow’s Tale, and other Poems.”





        1. All day the low-hung clouds have dropped

        Their garnered[23] fullness down;

        All day that soft, gray mist hath wrapped

        Hill, valley, grove, and town.





        2. There has not been a sound to-day

        To break the calm of nature;

        Nor motion, I might almost say,

        Of life or living creature;





        3. Of waving bough, or warbling bird,

        Or cattle faintly lowing;

        I could have half believed I heard

        The leaves and blossoms growing.





        4. I stood to hear—I love it well—

        The rain’s continuous sound;

        Small drops, but thick and fast they fell,

        Down straight into the ground.

        5. For leafy thickness is not yet

        Earth’s naked breast to screen,

        Though every dripping branch is set

        With shoots of tender green.





        6. Sure, since I looked, at early morn,

        Those honeysuckle buds

        Have swelled to double growth; that thorn



              Hath put forth larger studs[24].





        7. That lilac’s cleaving[25] cones have burst,

        The milk-white flowers revealing;

        Even now upon my senses first

        Methinks their sweets are stealing.





        8. The very earth, the steamy air,

        Is all with fragrance rife!

        And grace and beauty everywhere

        Are flushing into life.





        9. Down, down they come, those fruitful stores,

        Those earth-rejoicing drops!

        A momentary deluge pours,

        Then thins, decreases, stops.





        10. And ere the dimples[26] on the stream

        Have circled out of sight,

        Lo! from the west a parting gleam

        Breaks forth of amber[27] light.

        * * *

        11. But yet behold—abrupt and loud,

        Comes down the glittering rain;

        The farewell of a passing cloud,

        The fringes of its train.

        卡罗琳 · 安妮 · 骚塞(1786～1854)出生于英国汉普郡莱明敦附近，为诗人骚塞的第二任妻子，卡罗琳 · 鲍尔斯的名字更为人熟知。卡罗琳首部诗作《艾伦 · 菲茨瑟》出版于1820年。长达20多年来，她的作品一直匿名发表。1839年，她与骚塞先生结婚，使他得以延长10多年生命。卡罗琳诗歌言辞优雅，充满柔情，尽管不乏些许悲哀忧郁。下面段落来自最早发表在1822年出版的题为《寡妇故事及其诗歌》的诗歌集，有删节。





        1．低垂一天，云朵已经落下，

        农夫庄稼，亦已安然入仓。

        灰色雾霭，万般缱绻裹住，

        山丘沟谷，灌丛还有村庄。



              2．今天，我未曾听到那种声音，

        可以打破，自然万物的寂静；

        亦没听见，或许我可以说，

        漫长一天，没有生命的韵律。





        3．树干没有摇晃，鸟儿没有啭鸣，

        牛群，没有低声哞叫，

        枝叶生长，或者花朵绽开，

        我半信半疑，没有纹丝动静。





        4．默默站着聆听，我太爱这些声音，

        雨，接连不停地刷刷，

        碎细身影，密集落下，

        径直一跤，跌进土里长大。





        5．大地赤裸的胸膛，尚未舒展，

        绿叶沙沙，铺成天空的旗帜，

        此刻，每一根湿漉漉的枝干，

        都会萌发，植物的微观思考。





        6．曙光初露，美丽的金银花，

        星光点缀，骨朵又见丰满，

        含苞待放；亭亭玉立的枝杈，

        转眼冒出，深浅不一的嫩芽。





        7．紫丁香，风中绽放挺立，

        奶白色花朵，惊悚震撼，

        一瞥中感动，最是难抑，

        你的心中，流泻悠悠甜蜜。





              8．脚下大地，润泽丰盈，

        繁复优雅，竟是不期而遇，

        蛰伏精灵，一路暗香浮动，

        走过多少，金色生命年华。





        9．收割装仓，满囤的金子，

        欢快雨滴，大地交响奏鸣，

        刹那间，洪水翻滚泛滥，

        雨过天晴，禾苗萌发新绿。





        10．溪水淙淙，岁月流年的涟漪，

        穿梭奔涌，消失于远方天际，

        瞧！西边那缕离别的星光，

        隐约露出，金色琥珀的传奇。





        11．看呀！随着一声高喊，

        流星雨，划破天空消失，

        挥手作别，霓虹的云彩，

        裙裾飞扬，生命的斑斓花边。





        LESSON 37





THE TEA ROSE


        香水月季

        1. There it stood, in its little green vase, on a light ebony stand in the window of the drawing-room. The rich satin curtains, with their costly fringes, swept down on either side of it, and around it glittered every rare and fanciful trifle which wealth can offer to luxury, and yet that simple rose was the fairest of them all. So pure it looked, its white leaves just touched with that delicious, creamy tint peculiar to its kind: its cup so full, so perfect,its head bending, as if it were sinking and melting away in its own richness.—Oh! when did ever man make anything to equal the living, perfect flower!

        2. But the sunlight that streamed through the window revealed something fairer than the rose—a young lady reclining on an ottoman[28], who was thus addressed by her livelier cousin: “I say, cousin, I have been thinking what you are to do with your pet rose when you go to New York; as, to our consternation, you are determined to do. You know it would be a sad pity to leave it with such a scatter-brain as I am. I love flowers, indeed,—that is, I like a regular bouquet, cut off and tied up, to carry to a party; but as to all this tending and fussing which is needful to keep them growing, I have no gifts in that line.”

        3. “Make yourself easy as to that, Kate,” said Florence, with a smile; “I have no intention of calling upon your talent; I have an asylum[29] in view for my favorite.”

        4. “Oh, then you know just what I was going to say. Mrs. Marshall, I presume, has been speaking to you; she was here yesterday, and I was quite pathetic[30] upon the subject; telling her the loss your favorite would sustain, and so forth; and she said how delighted she would be to have it in her greenhouse; it is in such a fine state now, so full of buds. I told her I knew you would like to give it to her; you are so fond of Mrs. Marshall, you know.”

        5. “Now, Kate, I am sorry, but I have otherwise engaged.”

        “Whom can it be to? you have so few intimates here.”

        “Oh, it is only one of my odd fancies.”

        “But do tell me, Florence.”

        “Well, cousin, you know the little pale girl to whom we give sewing?”

        6. “What! little Mary Stephens? How absurd, Florence! This is just another of your motherly, old-maidish ways; dressing dolls for poor children, making bonnets, and knitting socks for all the little dirty babies in the neighborhood. I do believe you have made more calls in those two vile, ill-smelling alleys behind our house than ever you have in Chestnut Street, though you know everybody is half dying to see you; and now, to crown all, you must give this choice little bijou[31] to a seamstress girl, when one of your most intimate friends, in your own class, would value it so highly. What in the world can people in their circumstances[32] want with flowers?”





              7. “Just the same as I do,” replied Florence, calmly. “Have you not noticed that the little girl never comes without looking wistfully at the opening buds? And don’t you remember, the other morning she asked me so prettily if I would let her mother come and see it, she was so fond of flowers?”

        8. “But, Florence, only think of this rare flower standing on a table with ham, eggs, cheese, and flour, and stifled in that close little room, where Mrs. Stephens and her daughter manage to wash, iron, and cook.”

        9. “Well, Kate, and if I were obliged to live in one coarse room, and wash, and iron, and cook, as you say; if I had to spend every moment of my time in toil, with no prospect from my window but a brick wall and a dirty lane, such a flower as this would be untold enjoyment to me.”



              10. “Pshaw, Florence; all sentiment[33]! Poor people have no time to be sentimental. Besides, I don’t believe it will grow with them; it is a greenhouse flower, and used to delicate living.”

        11. “Oh, as to that, a flower never inquires whether its owner is rich or poor; and poor Mrs. Stephens, whatever else she has not, has sunshine of as good quality as this that streams through our window. The beautiful things that God makes are his gifts to all alike. You will see that my fair rose will be as well and cheerful in Mrs. Stephens’s room as in ours.”

        12. “Well, after all, how odd! When one gives to poor people, one wants to give them something useful—a bushel of potatoes, a ham, and such things.”

        13. “Why, certainly, potatoes and ham must be supplied; but, having ministered to the first and most craving wants, why not add any other little pleasures or gratifications we may have it in our power to bestow? I know there are many of the poor who have fine feeling and a keen sense of the beautiful, which rusts out and dies because they are too hard pressed to procure it any gratification. Poor Mrs. Stephens, for example; I know she would enjoy birds, and flowers, and music as much as I do. I have seen her eye light up as she looked upon these things in our drawing. room, and yet not one beautiful thing can she command[34]. From necessity, her room, her clothing,—all she has, must be coarse and plain. You should have seen the almost rapture[35] she and Mary felt when I offered them my rose.”

        14. “Dear me! all this may be true, but I never thought of it before. I never thought that these hard-working people had any ideas of taste[36]!”

        15. “Then why do you see the geranium or rose so carefully nursed in the old cracked teapot in the poorest room, or the morning-glory planted in a box and twined about the window? Do not these show that the human heart yearns[37] for the beautiful in all ranks of life? You remember, Kate, how our washerwoman sat up a whole night, after a hard day’s work, to make her first baby a pretty dress to be baptized in.” “Yes, and I remember how I laughed at you for making such a tasteful little cap for it.”

        16. “True, Kate, but I think the look of perfect delight with which the poor woman regarded her baby in its new dress and cap was something quite worth creating; I do believe she could not have felt more grateful if 1 had sent her a barrel of flour.”

        17. “Well, I never thought before of giving anything to the poor but what they really needed, and I have always been willing to do that when I could without going far out of my way.”

        18. “Ah! cousin, if our heavenly Father gave to us after this mode, we should have only coarse, shapeless piles of provisions lying about the world, instead of all this beautiful variety of trees, and fruits, and flowers,”

        19. “Well, well, cousin, I suppose you are right, but have mercy on my poor head; it is too small to hold so many new ideas all at once, so go on your own way;” and the little lady began practicing a waltzing step before the glass with great satisfaction.

        1．客厅窗边，一个浅乌檀色的花架上，一枝月季插在小小的绿色花瓶里。昂贵的锦缎窗帘，配着昂贵的窗饰挂幔垂落。房间里，到处摆满了亮闪闪的稀罕物件，满目珠光宝气，满屋奢贵豪华。那支香水月季当属鹤立鸡群，素朴中透着清纯可爱，奶白色精致叶瓣，稀有品种的色泽，它的花瓣饱满精致，花朵稍微前倾，宛如沉浸一种天籁富足的天地。哦，人类何时亦能创造出这类精美生物？

        2．阳光泻过窗帘，香水月季旁边更为亮眼。一位年轻女子斜倚在无背沙发上，活泼可爱的表妹正在与她聊天，“哦，表姐，我一直在想，如果你去纽约，怎么处理你那宝贝月季？大家很吃惊，你怎么坚持要走。你要知道，把你钟爱的花留给我这样一个总爱丢三落四的主儿，可真够倒霉的。我当然喜欢花，或换句话说，我偏爱那些修剪扎好后、风风光光捧去参加聚会的花。这种花那么娇嫩，每天打理起来烦不胜烦，我才没有兴趣哩。”

        3．“凯特，别那么紧张，”弗罗伦丝笑着说，“我可不指望你有那本事，我这有些救急的办法，你不妨查查。”

        4．“哦，那么，你就明白我准备说什么了。我在揣摩马歇尔夫人与你说话的意思。她昨天来这里了，谈到你要离开，我就很难过，还与她谈些不忍美好流失的道理等等；她说，如果香水月季能送给她，挪到她家花房，她可就太开心了。眼看花快开了，花苞这么多，我告诉她，我知道你打算将花送给她，再说，你对马歇尔夫人那么好，是吗？”

        5．“哦，凯特，很抱歉，我还在想其他办法。”

        “还会是谁？你在这没什么密友吧。”

        “哦，不过是个奇怪想法吧。”

        “那，弗罗伦丝，你得告诉我。”

        “好吧，表妹，你还记得我们送缝活时，那个脸色苍白的小姑娘吗？”

        6．“什么？你说的是玛丽·斯蒂芬？弗罗伦丝，你太搞笑了！你婆婆妈妈、古板迂腐的另外一张面孔竟然是这样，什么给穷孩子缝娃娃啦，缝制帽子，钩织袜子啦，给街坊四邻那些脏兮兮的孩子送点礼物什么的。我确实相信，你在我们屋后那两条臭味难闻的街巷里走家串户，比你在宽敞漂亮的栗树大街上做得多，虽然你知道，那些穷人眼巴巴地想见到你。既然这样，给所有穷人都戴上皇冠？借机再给那个做缝活小姑娘送件小玩意，你那些同阶层的闺蜜好友，或许极为赞赏这些，我实在搞不懂，生活在世上如此低劣环境里的人难道需要花？”



              7．“这正是我想做的，”弗罗伦丝平心静气地说，“你难道没注意到，那小姑娘哪次来不是急切地想看花？你难道不记得，那天早晨，她那么可怜见地请求我，可否让她妈妈过来看看香水月季？她母亲也那么喜欢花！”

        8.“哎呀，弗罗伦丝，先想想，这么名贵的月季和那些火腿呀，鸡蛋，奶酪，还有面粉，统统挤在那间狭窄破屋的小桌上，斯蒂芬夫人和女儿兜转着忙着洗涮、熨烫，还要做饭。”

        9．“好了，凯特，如果我也没办法，只好住在简陋的破屋，就像你说的，忙着洗涮、熨烫、做饭，如果没有片刻空闲，窗外满眼只有颓败坍塌的砖墙，肮脏不堪的街巷，对我来说，这花难道不是无法言说的快乐？”

        10．“哼，弗罗伦丝，你太多愁善感了！穷人怎么有时间获取情感快乐。我才不相信呐，那香水月季能在她们家里养下去？那名贵的花是种在温室里的，月季对环境可是太挑剔了。”

        11．“哦，这一点，花朵从不会质问它的主人贫穷还是富有；史蒂芬夫人很穷，她缺少什么无关紧要，只要拥有和这里同样可以穿透窗子的美好阳光，那就够了。上帝创造出来的美好事物，在于它给予所有人相同的馈赠。你会看见，我那漂亮的香水月季在斯蒂芬夫人家里肯定会长得不错，与在我们家没什么两样。”



        12．“好了，不管怎么说，你真够搞怪！如果想送穷人东西，送点实用的东西总是不错，比如，一麻袋土豆，或一条火腿什么的。”

        13．“天呀！确实，土豆或火腿都是不可少的，那是穷人生存的首选或最渴望得到的东西，可是，我们为什么就不能给穷人精神上的微薄快乐，使她们内心获得少许喜悦，而这些，对我们来说不过举手之劳？我知道，许多穷人情感丰富，对美好事物相当敏锐，可他们活得实在艰难，也就自然钝化或磨灭了内在美好。否则，就鸟类花草或音乐欣赏能力而言，史蒂芬夫人，虽穷，亦绝不比我少。

        我留意到，那次斯蒂芬夫人来到我们家，仔细打量客厅里那些艺术摆件，尽管没说一句话，可她的眼睛很亮。你看看她家的陋屋、那些衣物还有居家必需品，当然杂乱不堪。你也该看到，当我想说把香水月季送给她们，她和女儿玛丽几乎欣喜若狂。”

        14．“天呀！这些或许不假，不过，我以前从未想到这些，这些每天苦力劳作的穷人能有什么欣赏品位。”

        15．“那么，为什么那些穷家陋户的破漏茶壶或瓦罐里，居然还种着天竺葵或月季，或者木箱里还养着牵牛花，沿窗户向上缠绕攀爬？这些难道不是说明，不管人的职业高贵或低下，人们内心难道不是同样渴望美？追求美？凯特，你还记得，有一次，我们家洗衣女工干了一天活回到家，为了第二天的洗礼仪式，通宵达旦地为孩子缝制新裙子吗？”“是的，记得，那时我还嘲笑你，费心劳神地做那么雅致的婴儿帽。”



              16．“不错，凯特，漂亮的外貌当然使人愉悦，那可怜女人觉得，只要她的孩子能穿上新衣、戴上新帽，她付出一些辛苦当然值得，我更相信，如果那时我再送上一把鲜花，在她看来，不管怎样感激涕零，都难以表达她的心情。”

        17．“是的，我以前从未想到周济穷人，除非他们确实需要，虽然，我一直想做力所能及的善事，却不愿偏离自己直觉太远。”

        18．“哎呀！表妹，倘若天堂的圣父亦依据这种方式馈赠我们，那么在这个世界上，或许，我们只有那些粗鄙不堪或乱七八糟的东西，而不会类似现在，那些花草、树木以及果实等等的美丽组合。”

        19.“得了，得了，表姐，我觉得你说得都对，发发慈悲，饶过我这不开窍的可怜脑瓜，怎能转眼装下那么多新鲜念头，你还是忙你的去吧。”接着，对着镜子，小姑娘悠然自得地练习华尔兹舞步起来。





        LESSON 38





THE CATARACT OF LODORE


        洛多大瀑布

        1. “How does the water

        Come down at Lodore?”

        My little boy asked me

        Thus once on a time;

        And, moreover, he tasked me

        To tell him in rhyme.





        2. Anon at the word,

         There first came one daughter,

         And then came another,

        To second and third

         The request of their brother,

        And to hear how the water

         Comes down at Lodore,

        With its rush and its roar,

         As many a time

        They had seen it before.





        3. So I told them in rhyme,

         For of rhymes I had store,

        And ’t was in my vocation

        For their recreation

        That so I should sing;

        Because I was Laureate

        To them and the King.





        4. From its sources which well

        In the tarn[1] on the fell[2];

        From its fountains

        In the mountains,

        Its rills and its gills[3];

         Through moss and through brake,

        It runs and it creeps



              For a while, till it sleeps

        In its own little lake.





        5. And thence at departing,

         Awakening and starting,

         It runs through the reeds,

         And away it proceeds,

         Through meadow and glade,

         In sun and in shade,

         And through the wood shelter,

         Among crags in its flurry,

         Helter-skelter,

        Hurry-skurry.





        6. Here it comes sparkling,

        And there it lies darkling;

        Now smoking and frothing

        Its tumult and wrath in,

        Till, in this rapid race

        On which it is bent,

        It reaches the place

        Of its steep descent.





        7. The cataract strong

        Then plunges along,

        Striking and raging

        As if a war waging

        Its caverns and rocks among;





        8. Rising and leaping,

        Sinking and creeping,

        Swelling and sweeping,

        Showering and springing,

        Flying and flinging,

        Writhing and ringing,

        Eddying and whisking,

        Spouting and frisking,

        Turning and twisting,

        Around and around

        With endless rebound;

        Smiting and fighting,

        A sight to delight in;

        Confounding, astounding,

        Dizzying, and deafening the ear with its sound





        9. Collecting, projecting,

        Receding and speeding,



               And shocking and rocking,

         And darting and parting,

         And threading and spreading,

         And whizzing and hissing,

         And dripping and skipping,

         And hitting and splitting,

         And shining and twining,

         And rattling and battling,

         And shaking and quaking,

         And pouring and roaring,

         And waving and raving,

         And tossing and crossing,

         And guggling and struggling,

         And heaving and cleaving,

         And moaning and groaning,

         And glittering and frittering,

         And gathering and feathering,

         And whitening and brightening,

         And quivering and shivering,

         And hurrying and skurrying,

         And thundering and floundering;

        10.Dividing and gliding and sliding,

         And falling and brawling[4] and sprawling,

         And driving and riving[5] and striving,

         And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling;





        11.And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,

        And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;

         And so never ending, but always descending,

         Sounds and motions forever and ever are blending,

        All at once and all o’er, with a mighty uproar,

        And this way the water comes down at Lodore.





        (Abridged from Southey.)

        1．“洛多瀑布的水，

        怎么落下的呢？”

        曾经一次，

        年幼的儿子问我，



              甚至特别要求，

        用韵律节奏告诉他。





        2．此后不久，

        女儿也有如此疑问，

        三个妹妹，

        走马灯地询问哥哥，

        当时，那瀑布的水，

        究竟如何落下。

        水吼叫着，直冲而下，

        许多许多次，

        大人们以前看过。





        3．我用诗歌节奏描述，

        那心底珍藏的韵律，

        留存于昔日旅程中，

        跌宕起伏的过去，

        我应该放开歌喉，

        将桂冠诗人的吟颂，

        告诉孩子，献与上帝。





        4．洛多瀑布老家，坐落在

        嶙峋多石的山顶，小湖边，

        山间，泉眼潺潺，

        淙淙流淌，汇成叮咚溪河，

        流过满山青苔、树丛，

        时快，时缓，过了一会，

        落脚到，雍积的小湖，

        它，居然睡着了。





        5．苏醒后，它再度启程，

        蜿蜒走过，芦苇沼泽，

        一路上，川流不息，

        流经草地，灌丛空旷，

        阳光下，或森林蓊郁，

        龙腾虎跃，訇然雷动，

        犹如，战争中万炮齐发，

        不嫌涓流，经久凸变，

        悄悄减慢，兀自加速，

        闪闪泛亮，粼粼碎屑，

        聚拢收缩，羽化飞天，

        湍流涡旋，银光耀眼，

        天地悸动，惊悚山川，

        仓促匆忙，紧锣密鼓，

        电闪雷鸣，跋涉艰难，

        分叉，滑翔，不断变异，

        跌落，嚎叫，到处蔓生，

        驱赶，撕裂，抗争不息，

        雾漫，影动，波光潋滟；

        这就是，洛多瀑布，

        一条涅槃再生之路。

        LESSON 39





THE BOBOLINK


        北美食米鸟

        1. The happiest bird of our spring, however, and one that rivals the European lark in my estimation, is the boblincoln, or bobolink as he is commonly called. He arrives at that choice portion of our year which, in this latitude, answers to the description of the month of May so often given by the poets. With us it begins about the middle of May, and lasts until nearly the middle of June. Earlier than this, winter is apt to return on its traces, and to blight the opening beauties of the year; and later than this, begin the parching, and panting, and dissolving heats of summer. But in this genial interval, Nature is in all her freshness and fragrance: “the rains are over and gone, the flowers appear upon the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.”

        2. The trees are now in their fullest foliage and brightest verdure; the woods are gay with the clustered flowers of the laurel; the air is perfumed with the sweetbrier and the wild rose; the meadows are enameled[6] with clover blossoms; while the young apple, peach, and the plum begin to swell, and the cherry to glow among the green leaves.

        3. This is the chosen season of revelry of the bobolink. He comes amid the pomp and fragrance of the season; his life seems all sensibility[7] and enjoyment, all song and sunshine. He is to be found in the soft bosoms of the freshest and sweetest meadows, and is most in song when the clover is in blossom. He perches on the topmost twig of a tree, or on some long, flaunting weed, and, as he rises and sinks with the breeze, pours forth a succession of rich, tinkling notes, crowding one upon another, like the outpouring melody of the skylark, and possessing the same rapturous character.

        4. Sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree,begins his song as soon as he gets upon the wing, and flutters tremulously down to the earth, as if overcome with ecstasy at his own music. Sometimes he is in pursuit of his mate; always in full song, as if he would win her by his melody; and always with the same appearance of intoxication and delight. Of all the birds of our groves and meadows, the bobolink was the envy of my boyhood. He crossed my path in the sweetest weather, and the sweetest season of the year, when all nature called to the fields, and the rural feeling throbbed in every bosom; but when I, luckless urchin! was doomed to be mewed[8] up, during the live-long day, in a schoolroom.

        5. It seemed as if the little varlet[9] mocked at me as he flew by in full song, and sought to taunt me with his happier lot. Oh, how I envied him! No lessons, no task, no school; nothing but holiday, frolic, green fields, and fine weather. Had I been then more versed[10] in poetry, I might have addressed him in the words of Logan[11] to the cuckoo:





        “Sweet bird, thy bower is ever green,

        Thy sky is ever clear;

        Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,

        No winter in thy year.





        “Oh. could I fly, I’d fly with thee!

        We’d make, with joyful wing,

        Our annual visit o’er the globe,

        Companions of the spring.”





        6. Further observation and experience have given me a different idea of this feathered voluptuary[12], which I will venture to impart for the benefit of my young readers, who may regard him with the same unqualified envy and admiration which I once indulged. I have shown him only as I saw him at first, in what I may call the poetical part of his career, when he, in a manner, devoted himself to elegant pursuits and enjoyments, and was a bird of music, and song, and taste, and sensibility, and refinement. While this lasted he was sacred from injury; the very schoolboy would not fling a stone at him, and the merest rustic would pause to listen to his strain.

        7. But mark the difference. As the year advances, as the clover blossoms disappear, and the spring fades into summer, he gradually gives up his elegant tastes and habits, doffs his poetical suit of black, assumes a russet, dusty garb, and sinks to the gross enjoyment of common vulgar birds. His notes no longer vibrate on the ear; he is stuffing himself with the seeds of the tall weeds on which he lately swung and chanted so melodiously. He has become a bon vivant[13], a gourmand[14]: with him now there is nothing like the “joys of the table.” In a little while he grows tired of plain, homely fare, and is off on a gastronomic[15] tour in quest of foreign luxuries.

        8. We next hear of him, with myriads of his kind, banqueting among the reeds of the Delaware, and grown corpulent[16] with good feeding. He has changed his name in traveling. Boblincoln no more, he is the reedbird now, the much-sought-for tidbit of Pennsylvanian epicures[17], the rival in unlucky fame of the ortolan[18]! Wherever he goes, pop! pop! pop! every rusty firelock in the country is blazing away. He sees his companions falling by thousands around him. Does he take warning and reform? Alas! not he. Again he wings his flight. The rice swamps of the south invite him. He gorges himself among them almost to bursting; he can scarcely fly for corpulency. He has once more changed his name, and is now the famous ricebird of the Carolinas. Last stage of his career: behold him spitted with dozens of his corpulent companions, and served up, a vaunted[19] dish, on some southern table.



              9. Such is the story of the bobolink; once spiritual, musical, admired, the joy of the meadows, and the favorite bird of spring; finally, a gross little sensualist, who expiates[20] his sensuality in the larder[21]. His story contains a moral worthy the attention of all little birds and little boys; warning them to keep to those refined and intellectual pursuits which raised him to so high a pitch of popularity during the early part of his career, but to eschew[22] all tendency to that gross and dissipated indulgence which brought this mistaken little bird to an untimely end.

         —From Irving’s “Birds of Spring.”


【中文阅读】

        1．依我看来，可以和欧洲云雀媲美、北美春天最快乐的鸟，该是北美食米鸟，食米鸟为北美人习惯俗称。就地理纬度而言，食米鸟通常五月出现，诗人在五月的季节抒怀与之呼应，人们钟爱的五月阳光最终光临。大约五月中旬，食米鸟飞来，盘桓此地将近一月。早些的冬天季节，人们易于勘查食米鸟的踪迹，然而，肆意的覆巢行为意味摧毁一年的美好开局。再晚些日子，天气炙热焦干，让人简直喘不过气来，老天仿佛释放出夏季的所有热量。只有五月气候凉爽适宜，大自然袒露出每一朵的清新芬芳，“雨季结束了，花朵绽放，鸟儿鸣啾，海龟也爬上岸来。”

        2．满树叶片蓊郁得碧绿晃眼，森林里洋溢着月桂花朵的成簇欢乐；蔷薇和野生玫瑰的芬芳浓郁；草地上铺满苜蓿草花朵，瓷釉般亮丽，苹果梨子还有李子的青嫩果实正在急遽地胀大，绿叶中草莓但见猩红艳丽点点。

        3．食米鸟狂欢的季节来临，这是它们翩翩飞来的隆重庆典，穿梭在馥郁花海的盛大节日。食米鸟一生追逐快乐、追逐阳光，情感丰富，引吭高歌。它乐于栖息在水丰草美的牧场或草原。当苜蓿绽开细碎的花朵，它总喜欢在花丛里鸣啾歌唱。它时而亦会伫立高高树枝，或风中招摇的细长草尖。它随着微风雀跃腾飞，流泻出一连串美妙音符，佩铃叮当。它清脆的鸣啾此起彼伏，宛如云雀的清脆歌喉，充满狂性和热烈的质感。



              4．食米鸟常常落在树梢，一旦梳理好翅膀，便开始亮开歌喉，它不时朝地面猛力拍打双翼，仿佛在自己歌声里陶醉忘形；它自然喜欢追求配偶，开口吟唱那些高亢曲调，好像唯有音欤相求，才能获取配偶芳心，当然，它那一副陶醉自得的快乐神情让人忍俊不禁。北美森林莽莽草原上所有鸟类，食米鸟是我孩提时代最为嫉妒的鸟。在一年中最美好的季节里，气候适宜，它在我漫步的小路上穿梭飞行。当自然万物声声呼唤田野，当田园情愫在每一个生命的心中悸动，可我，一个不幸的孩子，每天却被牢牢地囚禁在教室里。

        5．这个看起来像恶棍的家伙，放开歌喉从我身边飞过，它唱得那么开心，似乎伺机嘲笑我。哦，我嫉妒死它了！没有功课，没有作业，没有学校，除了假期、嬉戏、绿色田野及美妙气候，它真是一无所有。假如我具有更多的诗歌才华，原本可将诗人洛根送给杜鹃鸟的赞誉送给它。





        甜蜜的鸟儿，

        你的巢穴四季常青，

        天空那么清澈湛蓝，

        你的岁月没有漫长冬季

        你的歌声没有丝毫悲伤，





        哦，如果我能张开翅膀，

        和你一起比翼飞翔。

        鼓起幸福的双翼，

        一年一度，和春天做伴，

        完成飞越环球的梦想。





        6．经过进一步观察体验，对这个身披羽裳、耽于安逸享乐的主儿，我有了全新认识，鉴于年轻读者的需要，我乐于勇敢地传教。这些年轻人可能与我当时沉湎的感觉相同，那么嫉妒和赞赏食米鸟。当第一眼看到它，我便为之心颤，称它具有生命的诗意。从某种意义上说，食米鸟追求高雅以及享受的表达，它迷恋音乐、歌声，关注品位、敏感还有精致，因此，这种神圣的鸟类不容丝毫伤害，甚至学校那些淘气鬼们不会冲它投掷石块，淳朴的农民时而停下脚步聆听它歌唱。

        7．当然，不妨关注这些差异。随着光阴流逝，苜蓿草花儿凋谢，春天隐退，夏天到来，食米鸟不再执著于自己的高雅品位，它逐渐褪去诗意的黑色装束，换上赤褐色的粗鄙外表；它整日沉溺享受安乐，与那些常见的恶俗鸟儿没什么两样；它的歌唱不再悦耳，胃囊里也装满草籽，就在那些飞扬的野草上，它刚才还在摇晃着优美身躯，反复吟唱动听的歌谣。如今它过得很好，气色不错，不过饕餮之徒而已。很快，它便厌倦了简朴的生活方式，到处寻觅丰馔珍肴，对它来说，没有任何东西能比过享用美食大餐的受用。



              8．现在我们再度聆听，它与它的无数同类，穿梭在特拉华州的芦苇丛中，因饮食太好愈见臃肿不堪。旅途中，它更换了名字，不叫食米鸟，改称芦苇鸟了，居然成为宾夕法尼亚州最受热捧的小报趣闻，与伊壁鸠鲁享乐者们享有同等恶名。无论食米鸟飞到哪里，砰！砰！砰！全州老枪火钪争相对准它瞄准开火，成千上万只食米鸟不停地倒毙死亡。那么，它接受人们警告或者有所改变吗？哎呀！没有。食米鸟继续振动双翼，南方丰美稻田等待着它的光临。在那里，食米鸟狼吞虎咽险乎撑死，它的体态变得臃肿不堪，甚至无法飞起。它不得不再次更名，变成卡罗莱纳州闻名遐迩的稻米鸟，这里，将是它一生的最后舞台：看着自己与无数大腹便便的同类被唾弃，最后变成北美大陆南方餐桌上为人称道的一道烘烤大餐。

        9．这就是食米鸟的故事，曾经具有精神信仰、富有音乐气质、令人钦佩、追逐自然草原快乐、钟爱春天蓬勃的鸟儿，最终变异为恶俗拥趸，躲在角落里耽于世俗物质享受的恶鸟。

        这篇食米鸟的故事具有典型的道德意义，世上青少年需引以为戒。故事旨在告诫那些年轻人，必须恪守对美好事物与崇高精神的执著坚守，保持懵懂之初纯洁的品质高度，戒绝世俗世界声色犬马的物欲满足。无疑，致命的外在诱惑只会给迷途难返的年轻生命带来过早的凋谢与终结。

        LESSON 40





ROBERT OF LINCOLN


        罗伯特·林肯

        1. Merrily swinging on brier and weed,

        Near to the nest of his little dame,

        Over the mountain side or mead,

        Robert of Lincoln is telling his name:

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink.

        Snug and safe is that nest of ours.

        Hidden among the summer flowers.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        2. Robert of Lincoln is gaily dressed,

        Wearing a bright black wedding coat:

        White are his shoulders, and white his crest,

        Hear him call in his merry note:

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        Look what a nice new coat is mine;

        Sure, there was never a bird so fine.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        3. Robert of Lincoln’s Quaker wife,

        Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,

        Passing at home a patient life,

        Broods in the grass while her husband sings:

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        Brood, kind creature; you need not fear

        Thieves and robbers while I am here.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        4. Modest and shy as a nun is she,

        One weak chirp is her only note;

        Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,

        Pouring boasts from his little throat:

         “Bobolink, Bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        Never was I afraid of man,



              Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        5. Six white eggs on a bed of hay,

        Flecked with purple, a pretty sight!

        There as the mother sits all day,

        Robert is singing with all his might:

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        Nice good wife that never goes out,

        Keeping house while I frolic about.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        6. Soon as the little ones chip the shell,

        Six wide mouths are open for food;

        Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well,

        Gathering seeds for the hungry brood..

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        This new life is likely to be

        Hard for a gay young fellow like me.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        7. Robert of Lincoln at length is made

        Sober with work, and silent with care;

        Off is his holiday garment laid,

        Half forgotten that merry air:

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        Nobody knows but my mate and I

        Where our nest and our nestlings lie.

        Chee, chee, chee.”





        8. Summer wanes; the children are grown;

        Fun and frolic no more he knows;

        Robert of Lincoln’s a humdrum crone;

        Off he flies, and we sing as he goes:

         “Bobolink, bobolink,

         Spink, spank, spink,

        When you can pipe that merry old strain,

        Robert of Lincoln, come back again.

        Chee, chee, chee.”

        LESSON 41





REBELLION IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE PRISON


        马萨诸塞州的监狱叛乱

        1. A more impressive exhibition of moral courage, opposed to the wildest ferocity under the most appalling circumstances, was never seen than that which was witnessed by the officers of our state prison; in the rebellion which occurred some years since.

        2. Three convicts had been sentenced, under the rules of the prison, to be whipped in the yard, and, by some effort of one of the other prisoners, a door had been opened at midday communicating with the great dining hall and, through the warden’s[1] lodge, with the street.

        3. The dining hall was long, dark, and damp, from its situation near the surface of the ground; and in this all the prisoners assembled, with clubs and such other tools as they could seize in passing through the workshops.

        4. Knives, hammers, and chisels, with every variety of such weapons, were in the hands of the ferocious spirits, who are drawn away from their encroachments[2] on society, forming a congregation of strength, vileness, and talent that can hardly be equaled on earth, even among the famed brigands[3] of Italy.

        5. Men of all ages and characters, guilty of every variety of infamous crime, dressed in the motley[4] and peculiar garb of the institution, and displaying the wild and demoniac[5] appearance that always pertains to imprisoned wretches, were gathered together for the single purpose of preventing the punishment which was to be inflicted on the morrow upon their comrades.

        6. The warden, the surgeon, and some other officers of the prison were there at the time, and were alarmed at the consequences likely to ensue from the conflict necessary to restore order. They huddled together, and could scarcely be said to consult, as the stoutest among them lost all presence of mind in overwhelming fear. The news rapidly spread through the town, and a subordinate[6] officer, of the most mild and kind disposition, hurried to the scene, and came calm and collected into the midst of the officers. The most equable-tempered and the mildest man in the government was in this hour of peril the firmest.

        7. He instantly dispatched a request to Major Wainright, commander of the marines[7] stationed at the Navy Yard, for assistance, and declared his purpose to enter into the hall and try the force of firm demeanor[8] and persuasion upon the enraged multitude.



              8. All his brethren exclaimed against an attempt so full of hazard, but in vain. They offered him arms, a sword and pistols, but he refused them, and said that he had no fear, and, in case of danger, arms would do him no service; and alone, with only a little rattan, which was his usual walking stick, he advanced into the hall to hold parley[9] with the selected, congregated, and enraged villains of the whole commonwealth.

        9. He demanded their purpose in thus coming together with arms, in violation of the prison laws. They replied that they were determined to obtain the remission[10] of the punishment of their three comrades. He said it was impossible; the rules of the prison must be obeyed, and they must submit.

        10. At the hint of submission they drew a little nearer together, prepared their weapons for service, and, as they were dimly seen in the further end of the hall by those who observed from the gratings that opened up to the day, a more appalling sight can not be conceived, nor one of more moral grandeur, than that of the single man standing within their grasp, and exposed to be torn limb from limb instantly if a word or look should add to the already intense excitement.

        11. That excitement, too, was of a most dangerous kind. It broke not forth in noise and imprecations[11], but was seen only in the dark looks and the strained nerves that showed a deep determination. The officer expostulated[12]. He reminded them of the hopelessness of escape; that the town was alarmed, and that the government of the prison would submit to nothing but unconditional surrender. He said that all those who would go quietly away should be forgiven for this offense; but that if every prisoner were killed in the contest, power enough would be obtained to enforce the regulations of the prison.

        12. They replied that they expected that some would be killed,—that death would be better than such imprisonment; and, with that look and tone which bespeak an indomitable[13] purpose, they declared that not a man should leave the hall alive till the flogging was remitted. At this period of the discussion their evil passions seemed to be more inflamed, and one or two offered to destroy the officer, who still stood firmer and with a more temperate pulse than did his friends, who saw from above, but could not avert, the danger that threatened him.

        13. Just at this moment, and in about fifteen minutes from the commencement of the tumult, the officer saw the feet of the marines, on whose presence alone he relied for succor, filing by the small upper lights. Without any apparent anxiety, he had repeatedly turned his attention to their approach; and now he knew that it was his only time to escape, before the conflict became, as was expected, one of the most dark and dreadful in the world.

        14. He stepped slowly backward, still urging them to depart before the officers were driven to use the last resort of firearms. When within three or four feet of the door, it was opened, and closed instantly again as he sprang through, and was thus unexpectedly restored to his friends.



              15. Major Wainright was requested to order his men to fire down upon the convicts through the little windows, first with powder and then with ball, till they were willing to retreat; but he took a wiser as well as a bolder course, relying upon the effect which firm determination would have upon men so critically situated. He ordered the door to be again opened, and marched in at the head of twenty or thirty men, who filed through the passage, and formed at the end of the hall opposite to the crowd of criminals huddled together at the other.

        16. He stated that he was empowered to quell the rebellion, that he wished to avoid shedding blood, but that he would not quit that hall alive till every convict had returned to his duty. They seemed balancing the strength of the two parties, and replied that some of them were ready to die, and only waited for an attack to see which was the more powerful; swearing that they would fight to the last, unless the punishment was remitted, for they would not submit to any such punishment in the prison. Major Wainright ordered his marines to load their pieces, and, that they might not be suspected of trifling, each man was made to hold up to view the bullet which he afterward put in his gun.

        17. This only caused a growl of determination, and no one blenched[14] or seemed disposed to shrink from the foremost exposure. They knew that their number would enable them to bear down and destroy the handful of marines after the first discharge, and before their pieces could be reloaded. Again they were ordered to retire; but they answered with more ferocity than ever. The marines were ordered to take their aim so as to be sure and kill as many as possible. Their guns were presented, but not a prisoner stirred, except to grasp more firmly his weapon.

        18. Still desirous to avoid such a tremendous slaughter as must have followed the discharge of a single gun, Major Wainright advanced a step or two, and spoke even more firmly than before, urging them to depart. Again, and while looking directly into the muzzles of the guns which they had seen loaded with ball, they declared their intention “to fight it out.” This intrepid[15] officer then took out his watch, and told his men to hold their pieces aimed at the convicts, but not to fire till they had orders; then, turning to the prisoners, he said: “You must leave this hall; I give you three minutes to decide; if at the end of that time a man remains, he shall be shot dead.”

        19. No situation of greater interest than this can be conceived. At one end of the hall, a fearful multitude of the most desperate and powerful men in existence, waiting for the assault; at the other, a little band of disciplined men, waiting with arms presented, and ready, upon the least motion or sign, to begin the carnage; and their tall and imposing commander, holding up his watch to count the lapse of three minutes, given as the reprieve[16] to the lives of hundreds. No poet or painter can conceive a spectacle of more dark and terrible sublimity; no human heart can conceive a situation of more appalling suspense.

        20. For two minutes not a person nor a muscle moved; not a sound was heard in the unwonted stillness of the prison, except the labored breathings of the infuriated wretches, as they began to pant between fear and revenge: at the expiration of two minutes, during which they had faced the ministers of death with unblenching eyes, two or three of those in the rear, and nearest the further entrance, went slowly out; a few more followed the example, dropping out quietly and deliberately: and before half of the last minute was gone, every man was struck by the panic, and crowded for an exit, and the hall was cleared, as if by magic.



              21. Thus the steady firmness of moral force and the strong effect of determination, acting deliberately, awed the most savage men, and suppressed a scene of carnage, which would have instantly followed the least precipitancy[17] or exertion of physical force.

        —J. T. Buckingham.





        “It may be that more lofty courage dwells

        In one weak heart which braves all adverse fate

        Than does in his whose soul indignant swells,

        Warmed by the fight, or cheered through high debate.”

        1.几年前，马萨诸塞州监狱发生叛乱，当监狱警官们目睹这场惨绝人寰的暴乱，奋起反抗这一闻所未闻的恐怖行为，他们临危不惧而表现出崇高的正义感与罕见的勇气令人钦佩、震撼。

        2.三个罪犯已被依法判决，依据监狱律令，还将在监狱院内接受鞭刑，由于其他一位囚徒的精心策划，中午，这一消息由通往囚犯大型餐厅的一间看守房悄悄传出，在餐厅内不胫而走，并传到监狱外面。

        3.囚犯餐厅极长，光线阴暗，空气潮湿，屋顶基本与监狱地面持平。餐厅为全体囚犯的集合之处，里面放有棍棒之类工具，方便囚犯们随手抓起，进入各自工作车间。

        4.现在，各种刀锤凿钻，所以可以用作武器的家什，都掌控在这些凶残的暴徒手中。这些罪犯因非法侵犯他人权利而与世隔绝；与此同时也形成暴力、邪恶及惊人才华的荟萃麇集，世界上几乎不存在可以与之抗衡的势力，甚而包括意大利最为凶残的黑帮。

        5.任何男囚，无论年龄身份，凡涉犯各类重罪，按规定一律穿戴统一杂色的狱服，以表现重罪囚犯野蛮与魔性的外貌特征及内心凶残。这些重罪囚犯被关押在一起的唯一理由，旨在避免次日早晨，有可能对同监狱其他人犯造成人身伤害。



        6.当时，监狱典狱长、医生以及部分警官都已赶到现场，他们因可能引发冲突而产生严重后果倍感警觉，并试图恢复常规秩序。囚犯们乱哄哄地拥挤成团，与警方谈判磋商几乎无法进行，由于极度恐惧，哪怕内心最坚强的人也会失去正常心智。监狱暴乱的消息迅速地传遍整个小镇，一位性情温和、宅心仁厚然而级别较低的警官闻讯后匆忙赶到现场，冷静自若地走进狱方警官们中间。面对一触即发的危险境地，他的神情最为坚毅。



              7.那位警官即刻向韦恩赖特海军少将发出求救，少将为驻扎附近海军基地陆战队的指挥官，然后向同僚们陈述他将走进餐厅的意图与目的，即以强势态度表现震慑力威严，并劝导说服愤怒的罪犯。

        8.他的同僚无不大呼小叫地阻止他实施任何冒险举动，然而无济于事。他们让他随身带上一把匕首和一支手枪，他仍然拒绝携带任何武器进去。他对同事们说，他毫不畏惧，即便真有危险，这些刀枪根本帮不上忙。于是，不过拿了那根平日他走路用的拐杖，然后独自一人走进大厅，与美国联邦恶贯满盈、最为暴虐以及怒火中烧的囚徒们开始谈判。

        9.他严正指出，囚犯们手拿武器的集聚行为，严重地违背了监狱法规，对方则回答，他们已下定决心，促使狱方赦免三位囚犯。他说，这点完全不可能，监狱法规必须服从，囚犯务必退让。

        10.在貌似顺从的暗示下，囚犯们开始聚拢过来，时刻准备抄家伙。通过餐厅远端那处天花光栅，外面监视的警官们影影绰绰看到下面囚犯的举动。那一令人恐怖的景象看来模糊不清，那种高尚感动的牺牲亦无从获悉细节，只能看见那位警官孤身站在一群穷凶极恶的匪徒中间，哪怕任何只言片语不合，或眼神不对路，不过瞬间工夫，他们就可一拥而上将他撕成碎片。

        11.最可怕的危机已经降临。这种危机并非以嘈杂或诅咒形式爆发，黑暗中感觉的不过是那些暴戾眼神与紧绷神经，以及罪犯们毫不退让的残忍果狠。那位警官有礼有节地训诫囚犯，暗示他们无法逃脱的结局；小镇此刻亦已获知监狱的消息，除了无条件投降，狱方管理方不会屈从囚犯提出的任何条件。他还说，所有退出暴乱的囚犯将会得到宽恕，随后不再追究，但如果有囚徒在冲突中死亡，监狱将获取更多警力支持，以强化监狱法规的执行。

        12.囚犯们回应说，他们已经料到这场冲突中势必有人伤亡，但死亡的结局兴许比囚禁监狱更好；那神色语调无不显示了暴徒们不达目的、绝不罢休的凶残。他们不依不饶地声称，除非免除三位囚犯的鞭刑，否则没有一个人会活着离开餐厅。谈判期间，囚犯们邪恶情绪似乎正加剧膨胀爆发，甚至有一两个罪犯提出先解决那位警官。那位警官，仍然神情坚毅地站在那里，比他的同事们更为冷静温和。上面的人目睹这一场景，对随时可能威胁其人身安全的危险行为，只能束手无策。



              13.就在那时，距骚乱发生大约十五分钟后，通过天花板上的微弱光亮，那位警官看到了海军陆战队员的身影，他清楚自己可以依赖的救助近在眼前。他不露声色，脸上未有丝毫焦虑之情，不过密切注意士兵们愈发逼近的脚步。此刻，他内心明白，这是冲突发生前可以逃脱的唯一良机，毫无疑问，正是世上最为可怕紧张的时刻。

        14.他慢慢地往后挪动，嘴里仍然不停地劝说囚犯们，告诉他们最好在陆战队员们最后不得不开火前离开。离门三四英尺时，门突然被打开，他飞身跑了出去，旋即门重新关上，出乎意料地，他重新回到了同僚们中间。

        15.韦恩赖特海军少将接到请求，请求下令手下陆战队员通过那些窄小窗口迅速向罪犯们开火，先用炸药，然后实弹射击，直到囚犯们愿意退却；少将却采取一种更为睿智大胆的方案，即依赖坚不可摧的攻心战使这些暴徒陷入危境。韦恩赖特少将命令再次打开餐厅大门，带领二三十名列队士兵率先冲了进去，然后在餐厅另侧，面对拥挤成团的暴徒呈“一”字形迅速排开。

        16.少将对囚犯们开始喊话，说他奉命前来平息叛乱，希望能够避免流血，但他不会放弃餐厅里所有生者，直至每个罪犯愿意重新履行自身职责。似乎衡量一番双方力量后，囚犯们最后回答，他们中已有人决心赴死，只有等到最后时刻，才能看出究竟哪一方更为强势。他们发誓要血战到最后一个人，除非狱方解除对犯人的惩罚，否则他们不会屈从任何类似刑罚。韦恩赖特少将命令陆战队员们子弹上膛，当然，他们手中的枪并非拨火棒。士兵们端起枪口严阵以待，同时看着少将将他的子弹最后推入枪膛。

        17.事与愿违，双方紧张对峙激起了更为顽强的反抗，黑压压的囚犯中没有任何人退却，面对生命危险，没有人流露任何畏惧的举动。他们内心清楚，就人数对比来看，暴徒们占有相当优势，因为第一轮枪支开火后，子弹未及再度上膛，他们可以一拥而上，消灭为数不多的士兵。囚犯们再次被要求后退，但他们恶狠狠的回答愈见嚣张。少将要求手下准确瞄准，以确保尽可能多地射杀对方。士兵们枪支各就各位，但暴徒人群中没有任何人心悸恐慌，只是紧紧攥住了手中武器。

        18.最后一丝希望犹存。如何避免大规模的血腥屠戮，哪怕一枪射发亦会使所有努力霎时灰飞烟灭。韦恩赖特少将往前跨了一两步，用比先前更为坚定的语气力劝囚犯离开。径直面对子弹已上膛的枪口，他们重申“以武力解决”的明确意图。那位勇敢的少将随即取出他的手表，吩咐士兵们举枪瞄准，听到命令后开火，然后转身朝着囚犯们说，“你们必须离开餐厅，我给你们三分钟时间决定，如果三分钟后还有人坚持不走，一律就地枪决。”



              19.已到千钧一发的危急关口。大厅两端，罪犯与强悍军人正僵持对峙。一大群恐怖至极的困兽犹斗等待攻击，一小群训练有素的军人，端着枪严阵以待，等待手势或行动指令迅即开始屠杀；他们高大勇猛、威风凛凛的指挥官举着表计算三分钟滴答，从而决定数百人的生杀予夺。没有笔墨可以描绘比这幕场景更为黑暗恐怖的生死凝重；没有人可以预知这种骇人听闻的惊险悬念。

        20.双方互相僵持，时针滴答接近两分钟，所有的人纹丝不动，甚至身上肌肉亦不曾抖动。除却愤怒凶残的沉重喘息，甚至听不到一根针落的声音。在恐惧与复仇纠结中，两分钟时间到了，暴徒们呼吸急促起来。刚才面对死神毫不退缩的眼神出现变化。人群队伍后面，临近门口地方，三两人慢慢地退到门外，接着又走了好几个。离开的人一声不吭、格外谨慎地退出。最后30秒过后，深陷恐慌的囚犯们潮水般挤向出口，整个大厅刹那间变得空空荡荡，仿佛奇迹发生。

        21.囿于道德力量的稳健，坚韧的心理强势，指挥的谨慎运作，才会使穷凶至恶者产生敬畏，从而抑制了一场血腥杀戮，因为哪怕丁点轻率鲁莽或物力冲突都会让所有努力前功尽弃。





        或许聚集更为崇高坚韧勇气，

        愤懑不平的内心难以匹敌，

        弱小心灵，面对噩运奋起抗争，

        因抗争暴力温暖，因辩争胜利欢欣。





        （J·T· 白金汉）





        LESSON 42





FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY


        无信仰的内莉·盖

        Thomas Hood (b. 1798, d. 1845) was the son of a London bookseller. After leaving school he undertook to learn the art of an engraver, but soon turned his attention to literature. In 1821 he became sub-editor of the “London Magazine.” Hood is best known as a humorist; but some of his poems are full of the tenderest pathos; and a gentle, humane spirit pervades even his lighter productions. He was poor, and during the last years of his life suffered much from ill health. Some of his most humorous pieces were written on a sick bed.





        1. Ben Battle was a soldier bold,

        And used to war’s alarms;

        But a cannon ball took off his legs,

         So he laid down his arms!





        2. Now, as they bore him off the field,

        Said he, “Let others shoot,

        For here I leave my second leg,

        And the Forty-second Foot!”





        3. The army surgeons made him limbs;

        Said he, “They’re only pegs:

        But there’s as wooden members quite,

        As represent my legs!”





        4. Now Ben, he loved a pretty maid,

        Her Name was Nelly Gray;

        So he went to pay her his devoirs[18],

        When he’d devoured his pay.





        5. But when he called on Nelly Gray,

        She made him quite a scoff[19];

        And when she saw his wooden legs,

        Began to take them off!





        6. “O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!

        Is this your love so warm ’?



              The love that loves a scarlet coat

        Should be more uniform[20]!”





        7. Said she, “I loved a soldier once,

        For he was blithe[21] and brave;

        But I will never have a man

        With both legs in the grave!





        8. “Before you had these timber toes,

        Your love I did allow,

        But then, you know, you stand upon

        Another footing now!”





        9. “O false and fickle Nelly Gray!

        I know why you refuse:

        Though I’ve no feet—some other man

        Is standing in my shoes!





        10. “I wish I ne’er had seen your face;

        But, now, a long farewell!

        For you will be my death;—alas!

        You will not be my NELL!”





        11. Now when he went from Nelly Gray,

        His heart so heavy got,

        And life was such a burden grown,

        It made him take a knot!





        12. So round his melancholy neck,

        A rope he did entwine,

        And for the second time in life.

        Enlisted in the Line!





        13. One end he tied around a beam,

        And then removed his pegs,

        And, as his legs were off, of course

        He soon was off his legs.





        14. And there he hung till he was dead

        As any nail in town:

        For, though distress had cut him up,

        It could not cut him down!

        1．本 · 巴特是位年轻士兵，

        冲锋在前，杀敌勇猛，

        炮火中，他失去了双腿，

        无奈中，只有退出战斗。





        2．战友们，将他撤离战场，

        他说，“好吧，让别人为我报仇，

        这块战场，我留下两条腿，

        总共四十二条腿，丢在这里了。”





        3．随军医生，为他做副假肢，

        他说，“这些可都是木头疙瘩，

        唉！看来只有这些玩意，

        才能代表，我这双假腿！”





        4．本爱上一位漂亮姑娘，

        她的名字，叫内莉 · 盖，

        他告诉女孩，对她的仰慕，

        没想到，却是自咽苦果。





        5．他急切前去，探望姑娘，

        她却嘲笑，他像个傻瓜，

        看见他那双木制假腿，

        一气之下，将它们扔掉！





              6．“哦，内莉 · 盖！内莉 · 盖！

        这，难道就是你温暖的爱？

        你追求，那种奢华虚荣，

        面对残疾士兵，你怎会动心？”





        7．她说，“我曾爱过帅气大兵，

        他开心快乐，也很勇敢，

        但我，不喜欢那样男人，

        这辈子，再也无法站起！





        8．“当时，你没有失去双腿，

        我确实，接受了你的爱情，

        如今，你也早该知道，

        你不过站在，木头上面。”





        9．“哦，虚情假意的内莉 · 盖！

        我知道，你为何拒绝我，

        虽然我不再有腿，但别人

        恰恰站在我的靴子上。”





        10．“但愿，别让我再看到你，

        从此分手，永远再见！

        你就是我的死神——天呀！

        绝不是，我钟爱的美女！”





        11．本 · 巴特离开内莉 · 盖，

        他心情沉重，郁郁寡欢，

        生活，变得不堪重负，

        他整天变得纠结不安。





        12．本 · 巴特日夜，悲哀难抑，

        一根绳索，竟缠过脖颈，



              短暂生命里，死亡象征，

        长长的名单，报名参军。





        13．他把绳索，甩过横梁，

        然后果断地移去假肢，

        一旦失去身体支撑，

        当然，亦就离开了木头假腿。





        14．他悬挂梁上，死了，

        小镇墙上，一枚刺破的记忆，

        虽然，厄运无情将他击倒，

        可完全不曾，将他碾碎。





        LESSON 43





THE GENEROUS RUSSIAN PEASANT


        慷慨的俄国农民

        1. Let Vergil[22] sing the praises of Augustus[23], genius celebrate merit, and flattery extol[24] the talents of the great. “The short and simple annals[25] of the poor” engross[26] my pen; and while I record the history of Flor Silin’s virtues, though I speak of a poor peasant, I shall describe a noble man. I ask no eloquence[27] to assist me in the task; modest worth rejects the aid of ornament to set it off.

        2. It is impossible, even at this distant period, to reflect without horror on the miseries of that year known in Lower Volga[28] by the name of the “Famine Year.” I remember the summer, whose scorching heats had dried up all the fields, and the drought[29] had no relief but from the tears of the ruined farmer.

        3. I remember the cold, comfortless autumn, and the despairing rustics, crowding round their empty barns, with folded arms and sorrowful countenances, pondering on their misery, instead of rejoicing, as usual, at the golden harvest. I remember the winter which succeeded, and I reflect with agony on the miseries it brought with it. Whole families left their homes to become beggars on the highway.

        4. At night the canopy of heaven served them as their only shelter from the piercing winds and bitter frost. To describe these scenes would be to harm the feelings of my readers; therefore, to my tale. In those days I lived on an estate[30] not far from Simbirsk[31]; and, though but a child, I have not forgotten the impression made on my mind by the general calamity.

        5. In a village adjoining lived Flor Silin, a poor, laboring peasant,—a man remarkable for his assiduity and the skill and judgment with which he cultivated his lands. He was blessed with abundant crops; and his means being larger than his wants, his granaries[32], even at this time, were full of corn. The dry year coming on had beggared all the village except himself. Here was an opportunity to grow rich. Mark how Flor Silin acted. Having called the poorest of his neighbors about him, he addressed them in the following manner:



              6. “My friends, you want corn for your subsistence[33]. God has blessed me with abundance. Assist in thrashing out a quantity, and each of you take what he wants for his family.” The peasants were amazed at this unexampled generosity; for sordid propensities[34] exist in the village as well as in the populous city.

        7. The fame of Flor Silin’s benevolence having reached other villages, the famished inhabitants presented themselves before him, and begged for corn. This good creature received them as brothers; and, while his store remained, afforded all relief. At length, his wife, seeing no end to the generosity of his noble spirit, reminded him how necessary it would be to think of their own wants, and hold his lavish hand before it was too late. “It is written in the Scripture,” said he, “Give, and it shall be given unto you.”

        8. The following year Providence listened to the prayers of the poor, and the harvest was abundant. The peasants who had been saved from starving by Flor Silin now gathered around him.

        9. “Behold,” said they, “the corn you lent us. You saved our wives and children. We should have been famished but for you; may God reward you; he only can; all we have to give is our corn and grateful thanks.” “I want no corn at present, my good neighbors,” said he; “my harvest has exceeded all my expectations; for the rest, thank heaven: I have been but an humble instrument.”

        10. They urged him in vain. “No,” said he, “I shall not accept your corn. If you have superfluities[35], share them among your poor neighbors, who, being unable to sow their fields last autumn, are still in want; let us assist them, my dear friends; the Almighty will bless us for it.” “Yes,” replied the grateful peasants, “our poor neighbors shall have this corn. They shall know it is to you that they owe this timely succor[36], and join to teach their children the debt of gratitude due to your benevolent heart.” Silin raised his tearful eyes to heaven. An angel might have envied him his feelings.

        —Nikolai Karamzin.

        1．让 · 维吉尔唱响献给奥古斯都的赞歌，历史上天才睿者颂扬罗马大帝的圣明与伟绩。《贫民简略编年史》一书，耗费我大量的写作时间，包括叙述具有无私美德的菲洛 · 斯林一生，这位慷慨好施、品质高尚的人只是俄罗斯一位穷苦农民。我无需用花哨雄辩的语言维系自己写作，唯有内心谦卑，摒弃辞藻华美，才能径入主题。

        2．即使年代沧桑久远，回想起来，我的内心恐惧依然挥之不去，总会联想那本题为《饥馑记年》一书中描述的当年纪实。我还记得灾难发生的那个夏天，炙热烧焦舔干田野里所有庄稼，干旱未见丝毫减轻，绝望无助的农民眼里只有泪水。



        3．那年秋天，天气寒冷难挨。饥饿的乡民聚集在自家空空的谷仓周围，他们束手无策，脸上满是悲哀迷惘，村庄不再像往年那样，庆贺秋天丰收季节的来临。我还清楚记得那个接踵而至的冬天，空中弥漫一股濒死气息，无数家庭背井离乡外出乞讨。





              4．夜晚，饥民们只能在野外露天安歇栖身，尽管天寒地冻，北风刺骨，那是他们歇宿的唯一选择。就我书中记录来看，描述那些悲哀场面可能会伤害读者的情感。当年饿殍遍野，我居住的地方离辛比尔斯克不远，尽管我那时尚且年幼，那场饿殍遍野的恐怖印象仍然记忆犹新。

        5．菲洛·斯林，一个整日操劳的俄罗斯贫苦农民，住在我家附近的一个村庄。他依靠自己的勤勉辛苦，丰富准确的农作经验，精心地操持土地。幸运的是，即使那年灾年，他的地里庄稼亦收获不少，因居家耗费有限，他家的谷仓堆满了粮食。旱灾饥馑迫使全村老少不得不外出乞讨，维持生计，唯独他家例外，此时不失为暴富的最佳时机。那么，菲洛·斯林如何面对？他召集最为窘困的左邻右坊，向他们开诚布公地说出自己想法。

        6．“乡亲们，你们眼下需要粮食才能活下去，上帝保佑我今年收成不错，我家谷仓里堆满了粮食。你们每人都可领取全家生活必需的口粮。”在场农民无不大为惊愕，大家从未遇到如此慷慨的急公好义之人，因为，当时利欲熏心的罪恶不仅在乡村风靡盛行，人口众多的城镇亦到处充满狡诈欺骗。

        7．菲洛·斯林仁慈好施的赈灾一事传到其他村庄，饥民们纷纷来到他家，乞求周济粮食。好心的菲洛把灾民看成自己的兄弟姐妹，将余存粮食毫不吝惜地分给饥民。后来他的妻子眼见丈夫慷慨无休无止，只得提醒他还要考虑自家口粮。妻子的提醒总算不是太迟，他却坦然说道：“这句话写在《圣经》上。”即“你们要给人，就必有给你们的。”

        8．第二年，上帝听到了穷人的祷告，田里庄稼收成丰足。那些得到菲洛 · 斯林救助幸免于难的农民们，再次聚集到他家门口。

        9.“斯林先生，你看看，”他们说，“你送给我们粮食，救了我们的妻小。若不是你的仁爱之心，我们早已成为路边饿殍；但愿上帝报答你，只有上帝才能做到，我们回报你的只是粮食和真心感谢。”“好心的乡邻们，我现在根本不需要粮食，”菲洛说，“我的收成超过了最好期待，至于我所做的，感谢天上圣父，我不过是个卑微的践行者。”



        10．他们反复劝说菲洛，终究还是徒劳。“乡亲们，别这样，”菲洛说，“我不会接受你们的粮食。如果你们手中粮食富余，不如将粮食送给更为贫苦的乡邻。去年秋天，不少人无法播种，他们眼下仍需要粮食，我们为何不向他们伸出救援之手？朋友们，天主为此佑福我们。”“好吧。”心怀感激的村民们异口同声地说。“那些穷人需要帮助，他们肯定亦会知道，拯救之道在于众人援手，由于你们的仁爱之心，他们将教育后代学会如何感恩。”菲洛说着，仰望天空，眼眶泪水充盈，或许，快乐的天使正欣羡地注视着他。

        LESSON 44





FORTY YEARS AGO


        四十年前

         1. I’ve wandered to the village, Tom,

         I’ve sat beneath the tree,

         Upon the schoolhouse playground,

         That sheltered you and me;

         But none were left to greet me, Tom,

         And few were left to know,

         Who played with me upon the green,

         Just forty years ago.





         2. The grass was just as green, Tom,

         Barefooted boys at play

         Were sporting, just as we did then,

         With spirits just as gay.

         But the master sleeps upon the hill,

         Which, coated o’er with snow,





               Afforded us a sliding place,

         Some forty years ago.





         3. The old schoolhouse is altered some;

         The benches are replaced

         By new ones very like the same

         Our jackknives had defaced.

         But the same old bricks are in the wall,

         The bell swings to and fro;

         Its music’s just the same, dear Tom,

         ’T was forty years ago.





         4. The spring that bubbled ’neath the hill,

         Close by the spreading beech,

         Is very low; ’t was once so high

         That we could almost reach;

         And kneeling down to take a drink,

         Dear Tom, I started so,

         To think how very much I’ve changed

         Since forty years ago.





         5. Near by that spring, upon an elm,

         You know, I cut your name,

         Your sweetheart’s just beneath it, Tom;

         And you did mine the same.

         Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark;

         ’T was dying sure, but slow,

         Just as that one whose name you cut

         Died forty years ago.





         6. My lids have long been dry, Tom,

         But tears came in my eyes:

         I thought of her I loved so well,

         Those early broken ties.

         I visited the old churchyard,

         And took some flowers to strew

         Upon the graves of those we loved

         Just forty years ago.





         7. Some are in the churchyard laid,

         Some sleep beneath the sea;

         And none are left of our old class

         Excepting you and me.

         And when our time shall come, Tom,

         And we are called to go,

         I hope we’ll meet with those we loved

         Some forty years ago.

        1．汤姆，我在村里徘徊，

        在那棵树底坐下，

        当年你我遮阴的地方，

        紧挨着校园操场。

        汤姆，没有故人前来问候，

        几乎无人知道，

        谁和我，在草地上玩耍，

        四十年前，往事历历在目。





        2．汤姆，草地翠绿一如往昔，

        孩子们赤脚地追逐游戏，

        与当年我们同样神气，

        兴高采烈，笑声清澈无比。

        老师在山上睡觉，

        坡上覆满了雪，他为学生，

        准备好滑雪玩耍之地，

        大约四十年前，久远记忆。





        3．破旧的校舍，变化不大，

        从前桌凳，都已置换，

        新的旧的，看来相差无几，

        我们口袋小刀，刻坏不少桌椅。

        陈年老砖，斑驳写在墙上，

        校园晨钟，还在风中摇晃，

        铃声叮当，仍然清脆无比，

        汤姆呵，四十年光阴摇碎。





        4．山下有处泉水，汩汩冒泡，

        紧挨泉眼，有片山毛榉林，

        现在山很矮，过去高不可攀，



              爬到顶，总是很难很难。

        我趴在泉边，啜饮山泉，

        汤姆，我在琢磨思忖，

        我的模样，究竟改变多少？

        时光穿梭，一晃四十年了。





        5．泉眼旁边，有棵棕榈树，

        你知道，我刻下你的名字，

        你心上人名字，镌刻下面，

        嘿嘿，居然与我暗恋一致。

        哪个坏家伙，剥去树皮，

        苟延残喘的树，慢慢死去，

        宛如，树干上清秀的姑娘，

        四十年前，远离你我而去。





        6．汤姆，我闯荡多年波澜不惊，

        此刻，涕泗横流难掩悲伤，

        当年，我爱得如痴如狂，

        一阵风，竟不知身在何方。

        我走进那间颓圮教堂，

        将带来的鲜花，轻轻放下，

        放在，我们爱过的坟茔前，

        往事四十载，心痛神殇。





        7．有的人，长眠教堂院内，

        有的人，永远躺在海底；

        班上同学，除却你我，

        如今相聚已是，阴阳相隔。

        汤姆，你我上路的日子快了，

        似乎有人，在远方呼唤，

        但愿，与爱恋的人重逢相依，

        共同翻动，人生如寄的篇章。





        LESSON 45





MRS. CAUDLE’S LECTURE


        高德夫人的演讲

        Douglas Jerrold (b. 1803, d. 1857) was born in London. A midshipman’s appointment was obtained for him, but he quit the naval service in a few years. He was then apprenticed to a printer. By improving his leisure hours he made himself master of several languages, and formed the habit of expressing his thoughts in writing An essay on the opera of Der Freischutz was his first published literary production. Before he was twenty-one years of age, he wrote “Black-eyed Susan,” one of the most popular dramas of modern times. Several other popular plays followed this. He was a regular contributor to the London “Punch,” from the second number, and edited, at different times, several papers and magazines. As a humorist, he occupies the first rank. The most noted of his works are his plays, and “Mrs Caudle’s Curtain Lectures,” “Saint Giles and Saint James,” “Bubbles of a Day,” and “Chronicles of Clovernook.”





        1. Well, Mr. Caudle, I hope you’re in a little better temper than you were this morning. There, you need n’t begin to whistle: people don’t come to bed to whistle. But it’s like you; I can’t speak that you don’t try to insult me. Once, I used to say you were the best creature living: now, you get quite a fiend. Do let you rest? No, I won’t let you rest. It’s the only time I have to talk to you, and you shall hear me. I’m put upon all day long: it’s very hard if I can’t speak a word at night; besides, it is n’t often I open my mouth, goodness knows!

        2. Because once in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button, you must almost swear the roof off the house. You did n’t swear? Ha, Mr. Caudle! you don’t know what you do when you’re in a passion. You were not in a passion, wer’n’t you? Well, then, I don’t know what a passion is; and I think I ought by this time. I’ve lived long enough with you, Mr. Caudle, to know that.

        3. It’s a pity you hav’n’t something worse to complain of than a button off your shirt. If you’d some wives, you would, I know. I’m sure I’m never without a needle and thread in my hand; what with you and the children, I’m made a perfect slave of. And what’s my thanks? Why, if once in your life a button’s off your shirt—what do you cry “oh” at? I say once, Mr. Caudle; or twice, or three times, at most. I’m sure, Caudle, no man’s buttons in the world are better looked after than yours. I only wish I’d kept the shirts you had when you were first married! I should like to know where were your buttons then?

        4. Yes, it is worth talking of! But that’s how you always try to put me down. You fly into a rage, and then if I only try to speak, you won’t hear me. That’s how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves: a poor woman is n’t allowed to get a word in. A nice notion you have of a wife, to suppose she’s nothing to think of but her husband’s buttons. A pretty notion, indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor women only knew what they had to go through!—what with buttons, and one thing and another,—they’d never tie themselves up,—no, not to the best man in the world, I’m sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle?—Why, do much better without you, I’m certain.



              5. And it’s my belief, after all, that the button was n’t off the shirt; it’s my belief that you pulled it off that you might have something to talk about. Oh, you’re aggravating[37] enough, when you like, for anything! All I know is, it’s very odd that the button should be off the shirt; for I’m sure no woman’s a greater slave to her husband’s buttons than I am. I only say it’s very odd.

        6. However, there’s one comfort; it can’t last long. I’m worn to death with your temper, and sha’n’t trouble you a great while. Ha! you may laugh! And I dare say you would laugh! I’ve no doubt of it! That’s your love; that’s your feeling! I know that I’m sinking[38] every day, though I say nothing about it. And when I’m gone we shall see how your second wife will look after your buttons! You’ll find out the difference then. Yes, Caudle, you’ll think of me then; for then, I hope, you’ll never have a blessed button to your back.

        7. No, I’m not a vindictive[39] woman, Mr. Caudle: nobody ever called me that but you. What do you say? Nobody ever knew so much of me? That’s nothing at all to do with it. Ha! I would n’t have your aggravating temper, Caudle, for mines of gold. It’s a good thing I’m not as worrying as you are, or a nice house there’d be between us. I only wish you’d had a wife that would have talked to you! Then you’d have known the difference. But you impose upon me because, like a poor fool, I say nothing. I should be ashamed of myself, Caudle.

        8. And a pretty example you set as a father! You’ll make your boys as bad as yourself. Talking as you did all breakfast time about your buttons! and of a Sunday morning, too! And you call yourself a Christian! I should like to know what your boys will say of you when they grow up! And all about a paltry[40] button off one of your wristbands! A decent man would n’t have mentioned it. Why don’t I hold my tongue? Because I won’t hold my tongue. I’m to have my peace of mind destroyed—I ’m to be worried into my grave for a miserable shirt button, and I’m to hold my tongue! Oh!but that’s just like you men!

        9. But I know what I’ll do for the future. Every button you have may drop off, and I won’t so much as put a thread to ’em. And I should like to know what you’ll do then! Oh, you must get somebody else to sew ’em, must you? That’s a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to his wife! And to such a wife as I’ve been, too, such a slave to your buttons, as I may say. Somebody else to sew ‘em’! No, Caudle, no; not while I’m alive! When I’m dead—and, with what I have to bear, there’s no knowing how soon that may be—when I ’m dead, I say—oh! what a brute you must be to snore so!

        10. You’re not snoring? Ha! that’s what you always say; but that’s nothing to do with it. You must get somebody else to sew ’em, must you? Ha! I should n’t wonder. Oh, no! I should be surprised at nothing now! Nothing at all! It’s what people have always told me it would come to; and now the buttons have opened my eyes! But the whole world shall know of your cruelty, Mr. Caudle. After the wife I’ve been to you. Caudle, you’ve a heart like a hearthstone, you have!

        道格拉斯 · 杰罗尔德（1803～1857）出生于英国伦敦，曾担任海军见习船员，数年后从海军退役，然后改行从事印刷。他利用闲暇苦读后熟练掌握了数门语言，并学会利用写作表达思想。《歌剧<魔弹射手>评论》为他首篇发表的文学作品。21岁之前，杰罗尔德已经写出《黑眼睛的苏珊》，该剧为现代最为流行的戏剧之一，此后又接连推出数部流行剧作。从第二期开始，他依据不同年代、数家报纸与杂志内容，定期为伦敦《英国木偶剧》编撰供稿。作为公认一流的幽默剧作家，他的戏剧作品堪称一流，包括《高德夫人的舞台剧演讲》、《圣徒吉尔和圣徒詹姆》、《一天的气泡》以及《克洛弗努克编年史》。





        1.好了，高德先生，但愿你现在脾气比今早要好点。呃，你不必立马吹口哨，别人可不会“嘘”“嘘”地吹着上床。不过，像你这样的人，我还真不能说，是不是存心想侮辱我？我以前总是说，你是这世上最好的人，可现在的你，简直是个恶魔。让你睡觉？不！我不会让你睡的，我不得不和你打开窗户说亮话，只此一回。听我说！我为你忙乎一整天，晚上还不能和你说上一句话，天呀！这真让人没法活了，再说，我不过偶尔才叨唠两句，老天知道！

        2.你这一辈子，哪怕衬衫掉个小小纽扣，你都能诅咒得沸反盈天。什么，你没有诅咒？高德先生！火冒三丈的时候，你真不知道你做过什么。什么？你没有火冒三丈,是吗？得了，我可不知道火冒三丈是什么意思；我现在当然懂了，高德先生，和你生活一起够长的，我心里再明白不过。

        3.你可真够不幸的，再没有什么倒霉事能比过你那衬衫上掉个小小纽扣，你埋怨不停。假如你有几个老婆，你的牢骚也不会少，这点，我当然清楚。我知道，我的手上从来不缺针少线，可以应付你还有那些孩子们。我成了你随意喝斥的奴隶，你感谢过我吗？为什么只要你衬衫纽扣掉了，你就要对我“哎”地叫上一声， 高德先生，我说过一次，高德先生，两次、三次，甚至无数次。我明白，高德先生，这世上没有任何男人衬衫纽扣得到这样隆重关注。我真的巴望还留着你第一次结婚的衬衫，我太想知道了，那会你的纽扣究竟在哪？

        4.没错，太该念叨念叨！不过，你怎么总是让我失望？只要我刚想开口，你就大发雷霆，你根本不会听我的。你们这些男人，就是喜欢大老爷们围在一起胡侃乱吹，倒霉的女人不许插一句话。一个老婆等于一个好点子，你也不想想，难道除去整天盯着老公纽扣，你老婆什么都不懂？一旦你结了婚，总会给你琢磨出好点子。嘁！如果那些倒霉女人只知逆来顺受，只瞅那些纽扣，那些七扯八拉的家庭琐事，她们才不会把自己和世上那些并不咋样的男人栓到一根绳上，没错，不会的。女人还能做什么？高德先生，天呀！没有你们这些男人，女人只会做得太好，这点，绝对错不了。



              5.不管怎么说，这是我的心思，纽扣当时没有掉；兴许你把纽扣拽掉了，说明你或许有话要说，这还是我的心思。噢，只要你不待见，你总是怒火中烧！没一件事不这样！所有我知道的，就是纽扣竟然从衣服上掉了，这可真奇怪了。我觉得，没有哪位妇女对她丈夫卑躬屈膝能比过我，只能说，这事太离谱。

        6.不过，倒还有件让你舒心的事，这种场面不会继续了，我烦透了你的坏脾气，难道不该聒噪聒噪你？嘁！你可以笑！我敢说，你一定捂不拢嘴地笑！没说的！我说到你心坎里了，那正对你的心思。我知道，我每天受尽折磨，但我真的无话可说。我离开后，我们等着看你的第二任老婆怎样打理你的纽扣！这样，你才会清楚前后差异。是的，高德，那时你才会想起我，但愿那时，你身上不会有一粒幸福纽扣。

        7.不！我可不是心怀怨恨的女人，高德先生，除了你，没有人这样说我。你说什么？没有人对我了解这么多？了解与评价这里没有任何关系。嘁！我不会有你那暴跳如雷的脾气，高德，我脾气实在太温顺了，这点倒不错，我不会像你那样忧心忡忡，或许我们能有套好房子。我当时一心指望你有个老婆，与你耳鬓厮磨！你本该清楚我们之间差异，但你却欺骗我，将我看成可怜的傻子，因为我毫无怨言，高德，我真是羞愧死了。

        8.作为父亲，你的模范示范可真不赖！你让儿子们像你一样举止恶劣。每天早餐时间，学着你喋喋不休地大谈你的纽扣！甚至周日上午也不例外。你还竟然标榜自己为基督徒！我真想知道，孩子们成人后将如何议论你！所有话题没一样离开鸡毛蒜皮，包括你哪只袖口掉只纽扣啦，举止优雅的绅士从来不屑谈这些鸡零狗碎。为什么我不住嘴？因为我不想住嘴！我就是想毁掉平和心态——我就是想哪怕为一只倒霉纽扣也恨不得愁得钻进坟墓。那么，就彻底闭嘴了！天呀！那才和你们这些男人一个鬼样！

        9.可是，我知道得为自己将来打算。你身上每粒纽扣可能都会掉落，我可不会那么心甘情愿地穿针弄线随时伺候，我还很乐意知道接下来你要做什么。噢，你一定要找其他女人给你缝，是不是？那可是老公甩给老婆的杀手锏。像我这样老婆当然一样，不妨这样说，我不过是对付你纽扣的奴隶罢，会有其他女人给你缝的， 不，高德，不，只要我还活着，就不会有！如果我死了呢？——还需要忍受什么？没人知道还有多久——一旦快死了，我会说——天呀！你简直是个只会打呼噜的畜生！



        10.你没有打呼噜？嘁！你总这样说，但所有一切全都无所谓了。你肯定还要找其他女人过日子，是吗？嘁！我不该大惊小怪。天呀！绝不！现在我对发生任何事情都不会吃惊。一点儿不会！如同别人总是告诉我那样，该来的，一定会来；纽扣才让我看清这些！其实，所有应该了解的就是你的残忍，高德先生，和你结婚后，高德，你简直就是铁石心肠。一点儿没错！

THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH


        乡村铁匠

         1. Under a spreading chestnut tree

         The village smithy stands;

         The smith, a mighty man is he,

         With large and sinewy hands;

         And the muscles of his brawny arms

         Are strong as iron bands.





         2. His hair is crisp, and black, and long,

         His face is like the tan;

         His brow is wet with honest sweat,

         He earns whate’er he can,

         And looks the whole world in the face,

         For he owes not any man.





         3. Week in, week out, from morn till night,

         You can hear his bellows blow;

         You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,

         With measured beat and slow,

         Like a sexton ringing the village bell,

         When the evening sun is low.





         4. And children coming home from school

         Look in at the open door;

         They love to see the flaming forge,

         And hear the bellows roar,

         And catch the burning sparks that fly

         Like chaff from a threshing floor.





         5. He goes on Sunday to the church,

         And sits among his boys;

         He hears the parson pray and preach,

         He hears his daughter’s voice

         Singing in the village choir,

         And it makes his heart rejoice.

         6. It sounds to him like her mother’s voice



               Singing in Paradise!

         He needs must think of her once more,

         How in the grave she lies;

         And with his hard, rough hand he wipes

         A tear out of his eyes.





         7. Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,

         Onward through life he goes;

         Each morning sees some task begin,

         Each evening sees its close;

         Something attempted, something done,

         Has earned a night’s repose.





         8. Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,

         For the lesson thou hast taught!

         Thus at the flaming forge of life

         Our fortunes must be wrought;

         Thus on its sounding anvil shaped

         Each burning deed and thought!





        —Longfellow

        坐落着一间铁匠铺，

        身材健壮的铁匠，

        宽厚有力的双手，

        褐色臂膀的肌肉，

        坚实得好像铁杵。





        2．他头发蜷曲又黑又长，

        长有一副棕褐色脸膛，

        迸发出道道星光四溅，

        像打谷上麸糠落在田边。





        5．周日，他去教堂做礼拜，

        坐在自己孩子们中央，

        聆听牧师庄严的祈祷，

        捕捉女儿的欢欣歌唱，

        在乡村合唱团弥撒声里，

        他的心无比欢畅。





        6．好像是母亲的声音，

        在伊甸园里轻轻吟唱。

        他肯定又想起了母亲，

        如何竟孤单躺进坟场，

        那双硬实粗糙的大手，

        擦拭不尽的眼泪流淌。





        7．劳累欢乐，悲哀惆怅，

        穿梭在，岁月绵延的长廊，

        晨曦中，开始新的艰苦劳作，

        夜幕里，他以锤声夯落收场。



              内心充足，打好每块锻铁，

        岁月安好，飘进每晚心灵之窗。





        8．衷心感谢，我的朋友，

        感谢你生动的一课，

        生活，要经历无数次淬火；

        命运，需扭曲锻造重撞。

        那訇然滚动的铁砧上，才能

        升华起炽热行为，还有思想。

        LESSON 47





THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW


        勒克瑙救援

        [From a letter to the “London Times,” by a lady, the wife of an officer at Lucknow.]





        1. On every side death stared us in the face; no human skill could avert[1] it any longer. We saw the moment approach when we must bid farewell to earth, yet without feeling that unutterable horror which must have been experienced by the unhappy victims at Cawnpore. We were resolved rather to die than to yield, and were fully persuaded that in twenty-four hours all would be over. The engineer[2] had said so, and all knew the worst. We women strove to encourage each other, and to perform the light duties which had been assigned to us, such as conveying orders to the batteries, and supplying the men with provisions, especially cups of coffee, which we prepared day and night.

        2. I had gone out to try to make myself useful, in company with Jessie Brown, the wife of a corporal in my husband’s regiment. Poor Jessie had been in a state of restless excitement all through the siege[3], and had fallen away visibly within the last few days. A constant fever consumed her, and her mind wandered occasionally, especially that day, when the recollections of home seemed powerfully present to her. At last, overcome with fatigue, she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in her plaid. I sat beside her, promising to awaken her when, as she said, her “father should return from the plowing.”

        3. She fell at length into a profound[4] slumber, motionless and apparently breathless, her head resting in my lap. I myself could no longer resist the inclination to sleep, in spite of the continual roar of the cannon. Suddenly I was aroused by a wild, unearthly scream close to my ear; my companion stood upright beside me, her arms raised, and her head bent forward in the attitude of listening.

        4. A look of intense delight broke over her countenance; she grasped my hand, drew me toward her, and exclaimed: “Dinna ye hear it? dinna ye hear it? Ay. I’m no dreaming: it’s the slogan[5] o’ the Highlanders! We’re saved! we’re saved!” Then flinging herself on her knees, she thanked God with passionate fervor[6]. I felt utterly bewildered; my English ears heard only the roar of artillery, and I thought my poor Jessie was still raving; but she darted to the batteries, and I heard her cry incessantly to the men, “Courage! courage! Hark to the slogan—to the Macgregor, the grandest of them a’! Here’s help at last!”

        5. To describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers would be impossible. For a moment they ceased firing, and every soul listened with intense anxiety. Gradually, however, there arose a murmur of bitter disappointment, and the wailing of the women, who had flocked to the spot, burst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our dull Lowland ears heard only the battle of the musketry. A few moments more of this deathlike suspense, of this agonizing hope, and Jessie, who had again sunk on the ground, sprang to her feet, and cried in a voice so clear and piercing that it was heard along the whole line, “Will ye no believe it noo? The slogan has ceased, indeed, but the Campbells are comin’! D’ ye hear? d’ ye hear?”



              6. At that moment all seemed indeed to hear the voice of God in the distance, when the pibroch[7] of the Highlanders brought us tidings of deliverance; for now there was no longer any doubt of the fact. That shrill, penetrating, ceaseless sound, which rose above all other sounds, could come neither from the advance of the enemy nor from the work of the sappers[8]. No, it was indeed the blast of the Scottish bagpipes, now shrill and harsh, as threatening vengeance on the foe, then in softer tones, seeming to promise succor to their friends in need.

        7. Never, surely, was there such a scene as that which followed. Not a heart in the residency[9] of Lucknow but bowed itself before God. All, by one simultaneous[10] impulse, fell upon their knees, and nothing was heard but bursting sobs and the murmured voice of prayer. Then all arose, and there rang out from a thousand lips a great shout of joy, which resounded far and wide, and lent new vigor to that blessed pibroch.

        8. To our cheer of “God save the Queen,” they replied by the well-known strain that moves every Scot to tears, “Should auld acquaintance be forgot.” After that, nothing else made any impression on me. I scarcely remember what followed. Jessie was presented to the general on his entrance into the fort, and at the officers’ banquet her health was drunk by all present, while the pipers marched around the table playing once more the familiar air of “Auld Lang Syne.”

        （本文来自勒克瑙一位官员妻子写给《伦敦时报》的一封信）

        1.死亡四处紧紧地盯着我们，再也没有任何路可以幸免逃脱。当我们看到死亡的脚步一步步走近，意识到与这个世界最后告别的时刻即将来临；伴随内心无以言传的巨大恐惧，相必坎布尔不幸的罹难者肯定也经历类似濒死体验；我们打定主意，即便受难赴死也不会屈服，甚至完全相信，不过区区24小时之内，一切终将尘埃落定，那位随军工程师也是这么说的。大家都很清楚，我们已经深陷最为难捱的黑暗。女人们彼此拼命鼓劲，完成分配给我们那些较轻的活儿，比如给那些街垒炮手送送消息，或给男人们发些生活补给；咖啡尤其必不可少，为此，我们从早到晚忙碌不停。

        2.我走出家门，看自己能否帮上什么忙，还要去陪伴杰西·布朗，我丈夫那个团里一位下士的妻子。可怜的杰西从围城开始，一直焦躁不安，不过几天时间，她明显地消瘦了，还一直在发烧，时而精神恍惚；尤其那天她似乎失去自控，真的好像回到了家乡；后来因疲劳过度躺卧地上，身上裹着一条格子呢毛毯。我坐在她的身边，指望能够唤醒她，她突然开口说道：“爸爸该从地里回来了。”





              3.后来，她陷入深睡，一动不动，好像没了气息，她的头还搭在我的膝盖上；我自己也感到难以克制的昏昏欲睡，尽管周围炮声隆隆。猛然，一声发狂怪异的尖叫刺入我的耳膜，杰西·布朗竟笔直地站起，立在我的身边，她的双臂高举，头部往前弯曲，好像在倾听什么。

        4.她的脸上突然现出难以克制的兴奋，紧紧抓住我的手，把我往她身边拖拽，一边尖声高叫：“迪娜，听见吗？你听见吗？喂，我绝不是在做梦，这是苏格兰高地人的广播！我们得救了！我们得救了！”说时迟，那时快，她扑通跪倒在地，感谢上帝的仁慈，情绪那么亢奋激昂。 此刻，我手足无措地站在旁边，我那听惯英语的耳朵，耳边只有炮声的滚滚轰鸣。我原以为可怜的杰西还在胡言乱语，她蓦然飞一般冲到街垒边，对那些荷枪实弹的男人们大声喊道：“加油！勇敢些！你们听到广播吗？那是麦格雷戈的声音，他是最棒的！我们的救兵终于来了！”

        5.实在无法叙述这些雷人话语对周围士兵的影响，士兵们顷刻间停止了射击，每一个人都在焦虑万分地聆听。然而，痛苦失望中，一片片窃窃私语渐次响起，夹杂女人们的恸哭哀号；她们刚才兴奋地聚拢过来，此刻却再度大放悲声。站在一边的上校军官摇了摇头，耳朵不甚敏感的我们，听见的不过是持续的枪炮声。折磨人的死样寂静不过片刻，杰西复又颓然倒地，四肢摊开，锐利的尖叫刺破天空，在整条街道回响，“你们难道没人相信?真的，广播停了，坎贝尔人打过来了，听见吗？你们真的听见了吗？”

        6.刹那间，所有人仿佛真的听到了远处上帝的声音。苏格兰高地人的风笛给我们带来了拯救的信息，此刻，这点已毋庸置疑。那个战栗尖利的声音不断响着，淹没了其他所有的声音。那个声音并非来自敌人的进攻，也不是来自我方人员的工事壕沟。没错，那愈发颤栗刺耳的苏格兰风笛在风中炸响，似乎宣泄着对敌人复仇的呐喊，随后略微柔和的曲调弥漫开来，宛如表达拯救患难朋友的迫切渴望。

        7.眼前未曾出现的一幕就这样发生了。一个人跪下了，然后，所有人齐刷刷地跪倒在地。勒克瑙使馆区无人不感激涕零地臣服上帝的力量，嚎啕大哭、低声呜咽或是喃喃细语的祷告裹杂成片。接着大家站了起来，上千人震耳欲隆的欢呼声在四面八方久久回荡，为快乐的风笛注入了崭新活力。

        8.为回应“上帝拯救女王”的众人欢腾，士兵们奏响了那首极负盛名的名曲——《友谊地久天长》，在场的每一个苏格兰人热泪盈眶。接下来的事情似乎淡忘了，我实在记不清后面发生了什么。杰西被隆重地介绍给走进要塞的将军；在官方举办的宴会上，所有在场的人为她的健康干杯。与此同时，乐手们围绕餐桌队列行进，《友谊地久天长》再一次在风中嘹亮奏响。





        LESSON 48





THE SNOWSTORM


        暴风雪

        James Thomson (b. 1700, d.1748) was born at Ednam, in the shire of Roxburgh, Scotland. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and afterwards studied for the ministry, but in a short time changed his plans and devoted himself to literature. His early poems are quite insignificant, but “The Seasons,” from which the following selection is taken; and the “Castle of Indolence,” are masterpieces of English poetry.





        1. Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends,

        At first thin wavering; till at last the flakes

        Fall broad and wide and fast, dimming the day,

        With a continual flow. The cherished fields

        Put on their winter robe of purest white.

        ’T is brightness all: save where the new snow melts

        Along the mazy[11] current.





        2. Low the woods

        Bow their hoar[12] head; and ere the languid sun

        Faint from the west emits[13] its evening ray,

        Earth’s universal face, deep-hid and chill,

        Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide

        The works of man.





        3. Drooping, the laborer ox

        Stands covered o’er with snow, and then demands

        The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,

        Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around

        The winnowing[14] store, and claim the little boon[15]

        Which Providence assigns them.





        4. One alone,

        The Redbreast, sacred to the household gods,

        Wisely regardful of the embroiling[16] sky,



              In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves

        His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man

        His annual visit.





        5. Half-afraid, he first

        Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights

        On the warm hearth; then, hopping o’er the floor,

        Eyes all the smiling family askance[17],

        And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is;

        Till, more familiar grown, the table crumbs

        Attract his slender feet.





        6. The foodless wilds[18]

        Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare,

        Though timorous of heart, and hard beset[19]

        By death in various forms, dark snares and dogs,

        And more unpitying men, the garden seeks,

        Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind.

        Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth,

        With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispersed,

        Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow





        7. Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind,

        Baffle the raging year, and fill their pens

        With food at will; lodge them below the storm,

        And watch them strict; for from the bellowing east,

        In this dire[20] season, oft the whirlwind’s wing

        Sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains

        In one wide waft[21], and o’er the hapless flocks,

        Hid in the hollow of two neighboring hills,

        The billowy tempest 'whelms[22]; till, upward urged,

        The valley to a shining mountain swells,

        Tipped with a wreath high-curling in the sky .

        詹姆斯 · 汤姆森(1700～1748)，出生于苏格兰罗克斯堡郡埃德纳姆。他在爱丁堡大学学习，后来学习神学，但很快投身文学。他早期诗歌影响不大，但他的《懒散的城堡》，以及下列段落节选的《季节》皆为英国诗歌名篇。





              1. 万籁俱寂，飘落迷蒙的漫天碎雪，

        霓裳起舞，化作羽毛的柔软凋零，

        山川广袤，刹那间天地卷入晦暗，

        扬扬纷纷，笼罩了村庄河流两岸。

        银装素裹，眺望一望无际的凝重，

        暮色渐褪，悄声融化的白雪皑皑，

        龙走蜿蜒，流水淙淙中欣然上路。





        2. 谦卑树木，风雪中低下白头，

        西陲夕阳，惨淡望萧瑟寒冬，

        光华不再，大地苍茫月色起，

        风寒料峭，江河隐退寂寥收。

        缤纷凌乱，飞雪狂舞遮不住，

        天地一色，生机无限绰影留。





        3. 低首徘徊，砥足耕作的老牛，

        落雪满身，巴望主人的草料，

        天寒地冻，繁重活计下煎熬；

        群鸟麇集，黑压压蜂拥飞来，

        粮仓屋前，饥饿难耐地寻找，

        麸皮翻飞，悲悯众生的回报。





        4. 孤独踟蹰， 象征家神的知更鸟，

        极度敏感， 隆冬里恶劣天气，

        万木肃杀， 田野里到处荒芜，

        北风刺骨， 穿过灌丛的长啸，

        鸟儿嘶鸣， 嗷嗷待哺的哀号，

        好心人呐， 数九寒天来喂鸟。





        5. 鸟儿轻轻，叩击灯火的窗棂，

        飞到灶台，敏捷轻盈地落地，

        跳跃桌上，啄食那面包残屑，



              风雪弥漫，难见的盛宴佳肴。

        全家目光，惊异这不速之客，

        可爱乖巧，来自何方的生灵。





        6. 寒冬腊月， 饥馁动物们纷纷逃窜，

        猎犬狂吠， 冰雪荒原上四面陷阱，

        胆怯野兔， 难逃黑暗死亡的包抄；

        处心竭虑， 血腥残忍的追踪猎手，

        大开杀戒， 利欲熏心地杀戮围剿。

        悲哀羊群， 满山积雪明晃晃耀眼，

        神色绝望， 仰望天空上乌云环绕，

        咩咩长叹， 雪地下刨开枯枝败草。





        7. 那牧羊人，疼爱你的牛羊吧，

        苛刻主人，无视严寒的肆虐，

        冰天雪地，围栏里草料稀少；

        可怜畜群，暴雪中无以遮挡，

        狂风咆哮，遽然盘旋过田野，

        卷走多少，惊恐不已的嘶叫；

        洪水淹没，相邻山间的洞穴，

        汹涌冲进，牛羊栖息的岩角，

        沟谷崩塌，山脊处雷鸣电闪，

        高空激流，一簇花环盘山绕，

        万物刍狗，何以见悲悯之道？





        LESSON 49





BEHIND TIME


        迟 到

        1. A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning speed. A curve was just ahead, beyond which was a station where two trains usually met. The conductor was late,—so late that the period during which the up train was to wait had nearly elapsed; but he hoped yet to pass the curve safely. Suddenly a locomotive dashed into sight right ahead. In an instant there was a collision[23]. A shriek, a shock, and fifty souls were in eternity; and all because an engineer had been behind time.

        2. A great battle was going on. Column after column had been precipitated[24] for eight hours on the enemy posted along the ridge of a hill. The summer sun was sinking in the west; reenforcements[25] for the obstinate defenders were already in sight; it was necessary to carry the position with one final charge, or everything would be lost.

        3. A powerful corps[26] had been summoned from across the country, and if it came up in season all would yet be well. The great conqueror, confident in its arrival, formed his reserve[27] into an attacking column, and ordered them to charge the enemy. The whole world knows the result. Grouchy failed to appear; the imperial guard was beaten back; and Waterloo was lost. Napoleon died a prisoner at St. Helena because one of his marshals was behind time.

        4. A leading firm in commercial circles had long struggled against bankruptcy[28]. As it had large sums of money in California, it expected remittances[29] by a certain day, and if they arrived, its credit, its honor, and its future prosperity would be preserved. But week after week elapsed without bringing the gold. At last came the fatal day on which the firm had bills maturing[30] to large amounts. The steamer was telegraphed at daybreak; but it was found, on inquiry, that she brought no funds, and the house failed. The next arrival brought nearly half a million to the insolvents, but it was too late; they were ruined because their agent, in remitting, had been behind time.

        5. A condemned man was led, out for execution. He had taken human life, but under circumstances of the greatest provocation[31], and public sympathy was active in his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions for a reprieve; a favorable answer had been expected the night before, and though it had not come, even the sheriff felt confident that it would yet arrive. Thus the morning passed without the appearance of the messenger.



              6. The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place, the cap was drawn over his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a lifeless body swung revolving in the wind. Just at that moment a horseman came into sight, galloping down hill, his steed covered with foam. He carried a packet in his right hand, which he waved frantically to the crowd. He was the express rider with the reprieve; but he came too late. A comparatively innocent man had died an ignominious[32] death because a watch had been five minutes too late, making its bearer arrive behind time.

        7. It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most important affairs, the fortunes of individuals, the weal[33] of nations, honor, happiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed, because somebody is “behind time.” There are men who always fail in whatever they undertake, simply because they are “behind time.” There are others who put off reformation year after year, till death seizes them, and they perish unrepentant, because forever “behind time.”

        1.火车近乎闪电般飞奔疾驰，前方有一处拐弯，拐弯过去通常是两列火车交汇站台。下行车晚点了，按调度常规安排，上行车等待的时间即将结束，但司机仍然希望能安全闯过那道弯口。一辆机车突然径直冲了过来，霎时间两车发生碰撞。尖叫震惊中，五十条生命瞬间消失，所有这些，不过由于一位司乘人员的迟到而酿成的人间悲剧。

        2.一场伟大的战役战事正酣，一列列军队连续进攻沿山脊守护的敌军，战斗持续长达八小时之久。夏日骄阳快要落山了，顽强的防御部队后备增援队伍已进入视野，发动最后一次进攻事不宜迟，否则，整个战役只能前功尽弃。

        3.全国紧急传令召集一支精锐兵团，如果部队能按时抵达，战事局面将大为改观。那位不朽的征服者，对自己麾下部队能投入战斗信心百倍，于是他将最后后备队亦悉数投入进攻，下令向敌军开火。整个世界对最终结果一目了然，格鲁希元帅未能按时抵达，帝国卫队被彻底击败，滑铁卢丢失，拿破仑死在圣·赫勒拿监狱，战争失利由于那位元帅的迟到。

        4.长期以来，商业圈里某家主要公司反对美国破产法。当时，这家公司有大量资金在加利福尼亚，原本指望在某一指定日子向外汇款，若款项按时汇出，它的信用名誉以及它未来发展机遇无疑将得以保障。但是，一个又一个星期过去了，这笔款项仍未支付。最后，至为关键的日子眼看到来，这家公司数额很大的几张汇票即将到期。黎明时分，一份加急电报发给游轮，但经过咨询发现，游轮并未携带现金，所以款项未能及时支付；游轮再次抵达时将差不多五十万资金付予资不抵债者，但，所有一切太迟了，这家证券交易所彻底破产了，因为他们的代理商未能及时汇款。



              5.一位死刑犯即将被执行死刑，考虑到在被动激怒情况下，他才犯下人命，所以，公众对他给予相当同情，数千人联名签名请愿对他实施缓期死刑，上峰死缓回复有待在死刑执行前一天晚上送达。尽管批复未到，连执行司法官亦相信，缓刑已毋庸置疑。第二天早晨，批复仍未到达。

        6.执行死刑的最后时刻终于来临，囚犯站到了预定位置，头上帽子被拉下遮住他的眼，闩门掉落，尸体在风中不停地旋转。就在那时，人们看到一位骑马人飞奔冲下山坡，马儿越跑越近，马嘴边吐着白沫。那骑马人右手拿着包，发狂地朝人群挥舞，他正是携带缓刑命令的快件骑手。但他来得太迟了，一位相对无辜的人被可耻地结束了生命，由于那位快件骑手的表慢了五分钟，他最终错过一条生命的宝贵。

        7.生活中此类事例并不乏见。最佳设定计划，重大或关键事件，个人命运、民族繁荣、荣誉、幸福乃至生活本身，由于某些人“迟到或晚点”皆成为庸常岁月的牺牲品。这些人，无论他们从事何种工作，失败总是与之形影不离，唯一原因不过在于他们“迟到或晚点”。还有一种人的失败原因在于：他们总是年复一年地推迟改变，直到死神将他们彻底带进坟墓。这种人推崇食古不化，因此，“迟到或晚点”对他们来说，意味永远终生错过。





        LESSON 50





THE OLD SAMPLER


        往日绣花图案

         1. Out of the way, in a corner

         Of our dear old attic room,

         Where bunches of herbs from the hillside

         Shake ever a faint perfume,

         An oaken chest is standing,

         With hasp and padlock and key,

         Strong as the hands that made it

         On the other side of the sea.





         2. When the winter days are dreary,

         And we’re out of heart with life,

         Of its crowding cares aweary,

         And sick of its restless strife,

         We take a lesson in patience

         From the attic corner dim,

         Where the chest still holds its treasures,

         A warder[34] faithful and grim.





         3. Robes of an antique[35] fashion,

         Linen and lace and silk,

         That time has tinted with saffron[36],

         Though once they were white as milk;

         Wonderful baby garments,

         ’Boidered with loving care

         By fingers that felt the pleasure,

         As they wrought the ruffles fair;





         4. A sword, with the red rust on it,

         That flashed in the battle tide,

         When from Lexington to Yorktown

         Sorely men’s souls were tried;

         A plumed chapeau[37] and a buckle,



               And many a relic fine,

         And, an by itself, the sampler,

         Framed in with berry and vine.





         5. Faded the square of canvas,

         And dim is the silken thread,

         But I think of white hands dimpled,

         And a childish, sunny head;

         For here in cross and in tent stitch,

         In a wreath of berry and vine,

         She worked it a hundred years ago,

         “Elizabeth, Aged Nine.”





         6.In and out in the sunshine,

         The little needle flashed,

         And in and out on the rainy day,

         When the merry drops down plashed,

         As close she sat by her mother,

         The little Puritan[38] maid,

         And did her piece in the sampler[39],

         While the other children played.





               7. You are safe in the beautiful heaven,

         “Elizabeth, aged nine;”

         But before you went you had troubles

         Sharper than any of mine.

         Oh, the gold hair turned with sorrow

         White as the drifted snow.

         And your tears dropped here where I’m standing,

         On this very plumed chapeau.





         8. When you put it away, its wearer

         Would need it nevermore,

         By a sword thrust learning the secrets

         God keeps on yonder shore;

         And you wore your grief like glory,

         You would not yield supine[40],

         Who wrought in your patient childhood,

         “Elizabeth, Aged Nine.”





         9. Out of the way, in a corner,

         With hasp and padlock and key,

         Stands the oaken chest of my fathers

         That came from over the sea;

         And the hillside herbs above it



               Shake odors fragrant and fine,

         And here on its lid is a garland

         To “Elizabeth, aged nine.”





         10. For love is of the immortal[41],

         And patience is sublime,

         And trouble a thing of every day,

         And touching every time;

         And childhood sweet and sunny,

         And womanly truth and grace,

         Ever call light life’s darkness

         And bless earth’s lowliest place.

        —Mrs. M. E. Sangster

        饱经沧桑，还是当年模样。





        2．冬季光阴，如此抑郁漫长，

        无精打采， 倦怠不断滋长，

        厌恶世俗， 走马灯辛苦操劳，

        从那阁楼， 缕缕微弱的灯光，

        用光，穿透人生茫茫黑暗，

        祝福卑微无助者，大爱无边。

        LESSON 51





THE GOODNESS OF GOD


        上帝的仁爱

        1. Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord, my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honor and majesty: who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind; who maketh his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire; who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed forever.

        2. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded[42] for them. Thou hast set a bound which they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

        3. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation[43], which sing among the branches. He watereth the hills from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

        4. He caused the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.

        5. The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted, where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. The high hills are a refuge[44] for the wild goats, and the rocks for the conies[45].

        6. He appointed[46] the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labor until the evening.

        7. O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.



              8. That thou givest them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.

        9. The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

        10. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.

        11. O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous’ works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and his strength; seek his face evermore.

        12. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

        —Extracts from the Bible.

        2.披上亮光，如披外袍，铺张穹苍，如铺幔子，

        3.在水中立楼阁的栋梁，用云彩为车辇，借着风的翅膀而行，

        4.以风为使者，以火焰为仆役，诸山升上，诸谷沉下(或作“随山上翻，随谷下流”)，归你为它所安定之地。

        5.将地立在根基上，使地永不动摇。

        6.你用深水遮盖地面，犹如衣裳，诸水高过山岭。

        7.你的斥责一发，水便奔逃；你的雷声一发，水便奔流，

        8.随山上翻，随谷下流，归你为它所安定之地。

        9.你定了界限，使水不能过去，不再转回遮盖地面。

        10.耶和华使泉源涌在山谷，流在山间，

        11.使野地的走兽有水喝，野驴得解其渴。

        12.天上的飞鸟在水旁住宿，在树枝上啼叫。

        13.他从楼阁中浇灌山岭，因他作为的功效，地就丰足。

        14.他使草生长，给六畜吃，使菜蔬发长，供给人用，使人从地里能得食物，

        15.又得酒能悦人心，得油能润人面，得粮能养人心。



              16.佳美的树木，就是黎巴嫩的香柏树，是耶和华所栽种的，都满了汁浆。

        17.雀鸟在其上搭窝。至于鹳，松树是它的房屋。

        18.高山为野山羊的住所，岩石为沙番的藏处。

        19.你安置月亮为定节令，日头自知沉落。

        20.你造黑暗为夜，林中的百兽就都爬出来。

        21.少壮狮子吼叫，要抓食，向神寻求食物。

        22.日头一出，兽便躲避，卧在洞里。

        23.人出去做工，劳碌直到晚上。

        24.耶和华啊，你所造的何其多，都是你用智慧造成的，遍地满了你的丰富。

        25.那里有海，又大又广，其中有无数的动物，大小活物都有。

        26.那里有船行走，有你所造的鳄鱼游泳在其中。

        27.这都仰望你按时给它食物。

        28.你给它们，它们便拾起来；你张手，它们饱得美食。

        29.你掩面，它们便惊惶；你收回它们的气，它们就死亡归于尘土。

        30.你发出你的灵，它们便受造，你使地面更换为新。

        31.愿耶和华的荣耀存到永远；愿耶和华喜悦自己所造的。

        32.他看地，地便震动；他摸山，山就冒烟。

        33.我要一生向耶和华唱诗，我还活的时候，要向我神歌颂。





        （摘自《圣经》诗篇104 :1-33）

MY MOTHER


        妈 妈

         1. Often into folly straying,

         O, my mother! how I’ve grieved her!

         Oft I’ve heard her for me praying,

         Till the gushing tears relieved her;

         And she gently rose and smiled,

         Whispering, “God will keep my child.”





         2. She was youthful then, and sprightly,

         Fondly on my father leaning,

         Sweet she spoke, her eyes shone brightly,

         And her words were full of meaning;

         Now, an autumn leaf decayed;

         I, perhaps, have made it fade.





         3. But, whatever ills betide thee,

         Mother, in them all I share;

         In thy sickness watch beside thee,

         And beside thee kneel in prayer.

         Best of mothers! on my breast

         Lean thy head, and sink to rest.

        1．我愚蠢地，时常离家漂泊，

        哦，妈妈，让你心生哀愁，

        我能听见，你的祷告，

        直到泪如泉涌，宽慰稍许；

        你默默站起，微笑着喃喃自语：

        “上帝，请保佑我的孩子。”





              2．那时，你还年轻、漂亮，

        怜爱地，依偎在爸爸身旁，

        声音甜美，神采飞扬，

        言语中，充满柔情。

        如今，秋叶凋零，妈妈，

        或许我，让你变了模样。





        3．无论什么疾病，落到你的身上，

        妈妈，我与你不离不弃，

        给你信心，依偎在你的身旁，

        祷告上帝，让你恢复健康。

        妈妈，你是我心中难言隐痛，

        请闭上眼，在我怀里进入梦乡。

THE HOUR OF PRAYER


        祷告时刻

        Felicia Dorothea Hemans (b. 1794, d. 1835) was born in Liverpool, England. Her maiden name was Browne. Her childhood was spent in Wales. Her first volume of poems was published in 1808; her second in 1812. In 1812 she was married to Captain Hemans, but he left her about six years after their marriage, and they never again lived together. She went, with her five sons, to reside with her mother, then living near St. Asaph, in North Wales. Mrs. Hemans then resumed her literary pursuits, and wrote much and well. Her poetry is smooth and graceful, and she excels in description. Many of her poems are exceedingly beautiful.





        1. Child, amid the flowers at play,

        While the red light fades away;

        Mother, with thine earnest eye,

        Ever following silently;

        Father, by the breeze at eve

        Called thy harvest work to leave;

        Pray! Ere yet the dark hours be,

        Lift the heart, and bend the knee.





        2. Traveler, in the stranger’s land,

        Far from thine own household band;

        Mourner, haunted by the tone

        Of a voice from this world gone;

        Captive, in whose narrow cell

        Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;

        Sailor, on the darkening sea;

        Lift the heart and bend the knee.





        3. Warrior, that from battle won,

        Breathest now at set of sun;

        Woman, o’er the lowly slain

        Weeping on his burial plain;

        Ye that triumph, ye that sigh,

        Kindred by one holy tie,

        Heaven’s first star alike ye see;

        Lift the heart, and bend the knee.

        1. 孩子，你在花丛间玩耍，

        红色灯火，落入黯淡，

        妈妈回应，你殷切目光，

        默默守护在，你的身旁。

        圣诞夜，微风拂煦，

        爸爸离开家，他要工作，

        圣父呀！穿越荒凉的别离，

        我的心在颤栗，默默祷告。





        2. 孑然一身，走向陌生土地，

        远远告别，温暖清馨家庭，

        悲哀萦绕，欢歌笑语走远，

        孤单魂灵，与这个世界再见。

        船舱狭仄，无奈秋叶飘零，

        阳光似乎，难得挽住时光，

        水手，漂泊在黢黑的海面，

        我的心在颤栗，默默祷告。





        3. 战士，从胜利的战场凯旋，

        正是日落夕阳，畅舒胸臆。

        女人哭泣，为卑微生命的消失，

        海上魂灵，究竟何处安依？

        你的荣归，你的深深叹息，

        家族的神圣血脉，血浓于水。

        你看见，天空升起第一颗星，

        我的心在颤栗，默默祷告。

THE WILL


        遗 嘱

        Characters.—SWIPES, a brewer; CURRIE, a saddler; FRANK MILLINGTON; and SQUIRE DRAWL.





        Swipes. A sober occasion, this, brother Currie. Who would have thought the old lady was so near her end?

        Currie. Ah! we must all die, brother Swipes; and those who live the longest outlive the most.

        Swipes. True, true; but, since we must die and leave our earthly possessions, it is well that the law takes such good care of us. Had the old lady her senses when she departed?

        Cur. Perfectly, perfectly. Squire Drawl told me she read every word of the will aloud, and never signed her name better.

        Swipes. Had you any hint from the Squire what disposition[47] she made of her property?

        Cur. Not a whisper; the Squire is as close as an underground tomb; but one of the witnesses hinted to me that she had cut off her graceless[48] nephew, Frank, without a shilling.

        Swipes. Has she, good soul, has she? You know I come in, then, in right of my wife.

        Cur. And I in my own right; and this is no doubt the reason why we have been called to hear the reading of the will. Squire Drawl knows how things should be done, though he is as air-tight as one of your beer barrels. But here comes the young reprobate[49]. He must be present, as a matter of course, you know. [Enter FRANK MILLINGTON.] Your servant, young gentleman. So your benefactress has left you at last.

        Swipes. It is a painful thing to part with old and good friends, Mr. Millington.

        Frank. It is so, sir; but I could bear her loss better had I not so often been ungrateful for her kindness. She was my only friend, and I knew not her value.

        Cur. It is too late to repent, Master Millington. You will now have a chance to earn your own bread.

        Swipes. Ay, ay, or the sweat of your brow, as better people are obliged to. You would make a fine brewer’s boy, if you were not too old.

        Cur. Ay, or a saddler’s lackey[50], if held with a tight rein.

        Frank. Gentlemen, your remarks imply that my aunt has treated me as I deserved. I am above your insults, and only hope you will bear your fortune as modestly as I shall mine submissively. I shall retire. [Going: He meets SQUIRE DRAWL.]



              Squire. Stop, stop, young man. We must have your presence. Good morning, gentlemen; you are early on the ground.

        Cur. I hope the Squire is well to-day.

        Squire. Pretty comfortable, for an invalid.

        Swipes. I trust the damp air has not affected your lungs again.

        Squire. No, I believe not. But, since the heirs at law are all convened[51], I shall now proceed to open the last will and testament of your deceased[52] relative, according to law.

        Swipes. [While the SQUIRE is breaking the seal,] It is a trying thing to leave all one’s possessions, Squire; in this manner.

        Cur. It really makes me feel melancholy when I look around and see everything but the venerable owner of these goods. Well did the Preacher say, “All is vanity.”

        Squire. Please to be seated, gentlemen. [He puts on his spectacles and begins to read slowly.] “Imprimis[53]; whereas, my nephew, Francis Millington, by his disobedience and ungrateful conduct, has shown himself unworthy of my bounty, and incapable of managing my large estate, I do hereby give and bequeath all my houses, farms, stocks, bonds, moneys, and property, both personal and real, to my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of Malt Street, brewer, and Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler.” [The SQUIRE here takes off his spectacles, and begins to wipe them very leisurely.]

        Swipes. Generous creature! kind soul! I always loved her!

        Cur. She was good, she was kind;—and, brother Swipes, when we divide, I think I’ll take the mansion house.

        Swipes. Not so fast, if you please, Mr. Currie. My wife has long had her eye upon that, and must have it.

        Cur. There will be two words to that bargain, Mr. Swipes. And, besides, I ought to have the first choice. Did I not lend her a new chaise[54] every time she wished to ride? And who knows what influence—

        Swipes. Am I not named first in her will? and did I not furnish her with my best small beer for more than six months? And who knows—

        Frank. Gentlemen, I must leave you. [Going.]

        Squire. [Putting on his spectacles very deliberately.] Pray, gentlemen, keep your seats, I have not done yet. Let me see; where was I? Ay, “All my property, both personal and real, to my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of Malt Street, brewer,”—

        Swipes. Yes!

        Squire. “And Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler,”

        Cur. Yes!

        Squire. “To have and to hold, IN TRUST, for the sole and exclusive benefit of my nephew, Francis Millington, until he shall have attained the age of twenty-one years, by which time I hope he will have so far reformed [55]his evil habits, as that he may safely be intrusted with the large fortune which I hereby bequeath to him.”

        Swipes. What is all this? You don’t mean that we are humbugged? In trust! How does that appear? Where is it?

        Squire. There; in two words of as good old English as I ever penned.



              Cur. Pretty well, too, Mr. Squire, if we must be sent for to be made a laughingstock of. She shall pay for every ride she has had out of my chaise, I promise you.

        Swipes. And for every drop of my beer. Fine times, if two sober, hard-working citizens are to be brought here to be made the sport of a graceless profligate[56]. But we will manage his property for him, Mr. Currie; we will make him feel that trustees are not to be trifled with.

        Cur. That we will.

        Squire. Not so fast, gentlemen; for the instrument[57] is dated three years ago; and the young gentleman must be already of age, and able to take care of himself. Is it not so, Francis?

        Frank. It is, your worship.

        Squire. Then, gentlemen, having attended to the breaking of the seal, according to law, you are released from any further trouble about the business.

        （人物： 斯威伯：酿酒人；柯里：马具商；弗兰克 · 米林顿；德洛[58]*法官）





        斯威伯: 这地方忒严肃正经了，柯里兄弟，谁能想到那老太太这么快就走了呢？

        柯里：哈，人人免不了一死，斯威伯兄弟，谁活得最长，谁就活得最好。

        斯威伯:不错，此言不虚。不过，既然我们都会死，留下身后世俗财富，老天有眼啊，律法还能这样眷顾我们，老太太去世时，她果真这么想的？

        柯里：当然，千真万确的事。德洛法官告诉我，老太太当时一字字大声读出自己遗嘱，签名时，她从未把自己名字写得那么顺溜。

        斯威伯: 你是否从法官那听到什么风声，她如何处置她的遗产？

        柯里：一丝口风也没听到，那家伙嘴紧得像墓里的死鬼。不过，有位在场的对我透露，老太太剥夺了弗兰克的遗产继承权，即她那不争气的侄儿，愣是一个子儿也没给他留下。

        斯威伯:真是这样？她太好了，真的吗？你要知道，我代表我老婆来这儿的。

        柯里：我可是代表我自己，之所以来听法官大人宣读老太太的遗嘱，我俩来这里的理由完全无懈可击。德洛法官知道如何处理遗产问题，尽管他不露丝毫风声，嘴巴严实地好像你家那些密封的啤酒桶。哦，瞧，那小流氓进来了，他准得来的，不消说，你懂的。

        【弗兰克 · 米林顿走进】



              柯里：你的仆从在此，年轻人，你的监护人已经去世了。

        斯威伯：米林顿先生，与挚友及心爱朋友最后离别，真够难过的。

        弗兰克：先生们，事已至此，如果当时我并非一而再、再而三对她的培养忘恩负义，想起这一点比她的去世更难忍受。她是我唯一的亲人，我真是枉费了她一番好心。

        柯里：现在再买后悔药，晚了，米林顿少爷。从今个起，你得自个在土里刨食了。



        斯威伯：咳，咳，你是得自己找活路了，汗珠子摔八瓣，那些比你还体面的人也得做活。你不如学学怎么酿酒，但愿年龄还不太大。

        柯里：哎呀呀，做个皮货商跟班学徒也不错，如果约束更严点的话。

        弗兰克：先生们，你们的话说明，我婶婶那样对我，真是我咎由自取。不过，你们还不够资格来羞辱我，我唯一指望你们能像我那样谦卑顺从地接受现实，好了，我得走了。

        【弗兰克正欲离开，德洛法官走进。】

        法官：等等，年轻人。你肯定不能离开，早上好，先生们，你们来得可真够早。



        柯里：但愿法官大人今天感觉不错。

        法官：对病弱之躯来说，我感觉相当不错。

        斯威伯：我相信空气闷湿不会再次影响法官大人的喘气吧。

        法官：当然，我觉得挺好。好了，既然法律上所有相关继承人都已到场，接下来，依据法律，我将当众打开死者遗言与遗嘱。

        斯威伯：【法官正打开密封】法官大人，以这种方式馈赠个人财产，还真是让人悲伤心痛。

        柯里：当我看到周围房产地产，只是看不见德高望重的主人，难免也心酸难过，还是圣父说得好，“凡事皆虚空。”

        法官：请坐，诸位先生。【他戴上眼镜，开始缓慢地读了起来。】



         “首先，鉴于我的侄子、弗朗西斯· 米林顿忤逆不孝以及忘恩负义的种种行为，证明他不配获取我的财产赠与，更无能力管理我的大宗资产，兹此，我愿将我的房产、农庄、股票、债券、现金以及所有财产，无论个人名下或实质意义而言，授予我亲爱的表弟们——麦芽街酿酒人塞缪尔 · 斯威伯以及裁缝院制皮商克里斯托弗·柯里。”【法官随后取下眼镜，悠闲自得地擦拭一番。】

        斯威伯：太慷慨的馈赠！好心的人呀！我一直那么敬重她！

        柯里：她真好，心地善良——，斯威伯兄弟，那么，什么时候我们开始分家产？我想，我想分到那座大套府宅。



              斯威伯：柯里先生，请你先别那么急吼吼好不好？我老婆早就眼巴巴想要那套房子了，没说的，那套房子该是我们的。

        柯里：斯威伯先生，这种交易我们两家都有发言权的，而我更有先挑的权利。请问，老夫人外出，哪次不是我腾出自家新马车？有谁知道——

        斯威伯：我难道不是她遗嘱上的首位继承人？难道不是我给她送上我家最好的淡啤酒，并且一送就是半年多！有谁知道——

        弗兰克：先生们，我该走了。【走出】



        法官：【极为慎重地戴上眼镜】安静点，先生们，请坐下。我还没念完呢。让我看看，刚才我念到哪里？哦，在这。“我所有的财产，个人名下或不动产，给予我亲爱的表弟们麦芽街酿酒人塞缪尔 · 斯威伯——

        斯威伯：“正是！”

        法官：“以及裁缝院制皮商克里斯托弗 · 柯里，”

        柯里：“不错！”

        法官：“为我的侄子弗朗西斯 · 米林顿唯一、独自受益需要，以上两人仅拥有保留托管义务，直到他二十一岁为止。我谨希望，但愿那时，弗兰克能够脱胎换骨，接受并胜任管理吾兹此馈赠与他的大笔财富。”

        斯威伯：究竟怎么回事？你不是说，我们都被蒙骗了吧？托管？“托管”这两字在哪？究竟在哪里？

        法官：喏，在这，这两个漂亮的古英语单词，差不多为我迄今为止最好的拼写。



        柯里：书写倒确实不错。法官大人，老夫人每次外出租借我马车费用，能够支付给我吗？这样我们就两不相欠了。这点，我可以向你保证。但我们是否令人耻笑呢？

        斯威伯：老夫人还得为她喝我的每滴啤酒付账，那该多少次！我们两位严谨辛劳的好市民居然被带到这里让人说成不知羞耻或不检点，反过来，我们还要为弗兰克管理财产，柯里先生，我们要让他感到，作为他的委托人，我们可不是轻易好打发的。

        柯里：一点不错。

        法官：别急，先生们，因为这份契约签字时间是三年前，因此那位年轻人已到了规定年限，也就是说，他已经能独自经营资产，是吗？弗朗西斯？

        弗兰克：是的，法官阁下。

        法官：那么，先生们，既然你们已目睹遗嘱打开，依据法律，接下来，你们与该遗嘱将不会有任何关系或纠葛。





        LESSON 55





THE NOSE AND THE EYES


        鼻子和眼睛

        William Cowper (b. 1731, d. 1800) was the son of an English clergyman, and was born in Great Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, England. He was sent to Westminster School when he was ten years of age, and he remained there, a diligent student, eight years. He then studied law, and was admitted to the bar, but he never practiced his profession. He was appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords when he was about thirty years old, but he never entered upon the discharge of his duties. He became insane, and was sent to a private asylum. After his recovery, he found a home in the family of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of this gentleman, he resided with the widow till her death—most of the time at Olney. His first writing’s were published in 1782. “The Task,” some hymns, a number of minor poems, and his translations or Homer, composed his published works. His insanity returned at times, and darkened a pure and gentle life at its close.





        1. Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;

        The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;

        The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,

        To which the said spectacles ought to belong.

        2. So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued[59] the cause,

        With a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning,

        While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,

        So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.[60]





        3. “In behalf[61] of the Nose, it will quickly appear,

        And your lordship,” he said, “will undoubtedly find,

        That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,

        Which amounts to possession, time out of mind.”





        4. Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,

        “Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle

        As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,

        Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.





        5. “Again, would your lordship a moment suppose

         (’T is a case that has happened, and may happen again)



              That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,

         Pray, who would or who could wear spectacles then?





        6. “On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,

        With a reasoning the court will never condemn,

        That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,

        And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.”

        7. Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),

        He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:

        But what were his arguments, few people know,

        For the court did not think them equally wise.





        8. So his lordship decreed[62], with a grave, solemn tone,

        Decisive and clear, without one if or but,

        That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,

        1．鼻子眼睛之间，引发奇怪争论；

        眼镜挤在中间，浑身都不如意，

        查究辩论焦点，看来世人皆知；

        眼镜这块地盘，隶属何方领地？





        2．舌头变成律师，辩析争论原因，

        口舌如簧技巧，满腹经纶学问，

        大亨巨头耳朵，坐镇权衡判决，

        感叹非凡天资，洞察入微能力。





              3．“代表鼻子利益，我会很快出现，

        你的贵族身份，当然毋庸置疑，

        鼻子佩戴眼镜，理应你是主人，

        类似从属占有，想必追溯久远。”





        4．然后携带眼镜，直奔耳朵法庭，

        “阁下身份待查，镜腿两脚分离，

        鼻子宽如山梁，简而言之设计，

        坐落山脊两边，类似一道马鞍。”





        5．“你的贵族身份，但愿再度认定，

        已发生的实例，可能还会再现，

        容貌或是面孔，若无鼻子央求，

        那么究竟有谁，能够佩戴眼镜？”





        6． “总之问题出现，我的论证表明，

        如此这样推论，法庭不会判定，

        眼镜明明白白，为了鼻子而造，

        鼻子相当清楚，皆为眼镜所用。”





        7．转身调换立场，律师谙知奥秘，

        呼吁支持眼睛，陈情它的原委，

        至于有力证据，几乎无人获悉，

        法庭并不认为，陈述同等明智。





        8．庄重严肃口吻，法官颁布结局，

        答案明确清楚，并无条件原因，

        无论何时何地，鼻子佩戴眼镜，

        白天抑或黑夜，眼睛应该关闭。





        LESSON 56





AN ICEBERG


        冰 山

        Louis Legrand Noble (b. 1813, d. 1882) was horn in Otsetgo County, New York. When twelve years of age, he removed with his family to the wilds of Michigan, but after the death of his father he returned to New York to study for the ministry, which he entered in 1840. About this time he published his first productions, two Indian romances in the form of poems, entitled “Pewatem” and “Nimahmin.” Mr. Noble lived for a time in North Carolina, and later at Catskill on the Hudson, where he became a warm friend of the artist Cole. After the latter’s death he wrote a memorial of him. Other works of this author are “The Hours, and other Poems,” and “After Icebergs with a Painter,” from which this selection is taken.





        1. We have just passed a fragment of some one of the surrounding icebergs that had amused us. It bore the resemblance of a huge polar bear, reposing upon the base of an inverted cone[63], with a twist of a seashell, and whirling slowly round and round. The ever-attending green water, with its aerial clearness, enabled us to see its spiral folds and horns as they hung suspended in the deep.

        2. The bear, a ten-foot mass in tolerable proportion, seemed to be regularly beset by a pack of hungry little swells[64]. First, one would take him on the haunch, then whip back into the sea over his tail and between his legs. Presently a bolder swell would rise and pitch into his back with a ferocity that threatened instant destruction. It only washed his satin fleece the whiter.

        3. While Bruin was turning to look the daring assailant in the face, the rogue had pitched himself back into his cave. No sooner that, than a very bulldog of a billow would attack him in the face. The serenity[65] with which the impertinent assault was borne was complete. It was but a puff of silvery dust, powdering his mane with fresher brightness. Nothing would be left of bull but a little froth of all the foam displayed in the fierce onset. He too would turn and scud into his hiding place.

        4. Persistent little waves! After a dash, singly, all around, upon the common enemy, as if by some silent agreement underwater, they would all rush on at once, with their loudest roar and shaggiest foam, and overwhelm poor bear so completely that nothing less might be expected than to behold him broken in four quarters, and floating helplessly asunder. Mistaken spectators! Although, by his momentary rolling and plunging, he was evidently aroused, yet neither Bruin nor his burrow was at all the worse for all the wear and washing.

        5. The deep fluting, the wrinkled folds, and cavities, over and through which the green and silvery water rushed back into the sea, rivaled the most exquisite[66] sculpture[67]. And nature not only gives her marbles, with the finest lines, the most perfect lights and shades, she colors them also. She is no monochromist[68], but polychroic[69], imparting such touches of dove tints, emerald, and azure as she bestows upon her gems and skies.





              6. We are bearing up under the big berg as closely as we dare. To our delight, what we have been wishing and watching for is actually taking place: loud explosions, with heavy falls of ice, followed by the cataract-like roar, and the high, thin seas, wheeling away beautifully crested with sparkling foam. If it is possible, imagine the effect upon the beholder: this precipice of ice, with tremendous cracking, is falling toward us with a majestic and awful motion.

        7. Down sinks the long water line into the black deep; down go the porcelain crags and galleries of glassy sculpture—a speechless and awful baptism. Now it pauses, and returns: up rise sculptures and crags streaming with the shining white brine; up comes the great encircling line, followed by things new and strange—crags, niches, balconies, and caves; up, up, it rises, higher and higher still, crossing the very breast of the grand ice, and all bathed with rivulets of gleaming foam. Over goes the summit, ridge, pinnacles[70], and all, standing off obliquely[71] in the opposite air. Now it pauses in its upward roll: back it comes again, cracking, cracking, cracking, “groaning out harsh thunder” as it comes, and threatening to burst, like a mighty bomb, into millions of glittering fragments. The spectacle is terrific and magnificent. Emotion is irrepressible[72], and peals of wild hurrah burst forth from all.

        路易斯 · 罗格朗 · 罗伯（1813～1882）生于美国纽约州奥齐戈县，12岁时，随家迁居到密歇根州偏远地区，然而，父亲去世后，他又返回纽约学习，准备进入宗教界。1840年，罗伯先生成为神职人员，同年出版了首部诗作，描述两位印第安人的恋情，题名为《珀瓦蒂姆》和《尼玛敏》。罗伯一度在北卡罗莱纳居住，后来搬到哈德森卡兹奇，在那里，他与艺术家科尔成为挚友，好友去世后，他写了科尔回忆录。罗伯先生其他著作包括《时间及其他诗歌》、《冰山后的画家》，以下段落选自最后一篇。





        1．周围新奇无比的冰山群让人目不暇接，我们刚路过一处由冰山一角坍塌崩裂生成的冰原断层。那块冰山像只巨大的极地熊，趴在倒立的圆锥体底部，贝壳般不停地扭动躯体缓慢旋转；不断涌出的绿色海水映照空中的晶莹剔透，螺旋褶皱的冰块棱角分明，悬浮于深海当中，清晰可触。



              2．那头极地熊状的冰山，高约十英尺的庞然大物，似乎在饥不可耐的一轮轮海浪嗜咬扑打中，早已习惯安然。一个浪扑卷它的腰臀，急遽反弹回去，急扫过它的尾部与双腿。转眼间，一道更为肆虐的大浪高高扬起，凶猛地扑打冰山后背，岌岌可危的崩塌就在眼前，极地熊宛如白色缎子般皮毛愈加亮丽。

        3．正当布来恩转身目睹这惊心动魄的一幕，一只孤兽急急地钻进它的洞穴。说时迟，那时快，一头彪悍的牛头犬翻滚着向他迎面扑来，一道声响打破了极地的宁静安谧，刹那间，只见一条白色尘埃铺散冲来，牛头犬的蓬松鬃毛银光闪亮，搅起漫天飞泻流动的呼啸雪沫，预示一场凶猛的攻击转瞬即至，布来恩转身拔腿飞奔，躲进了藏身地。

        4．固执坚韧的碎小浪花！似乎由于海水深处秘不可宣的约定，波浪从四面八方涌来，不约而同地猛烈撞击着冰山——它们共同的敌人，然后周而复始呼啸着卷土再来；浪花宣泄，发出震耳欲聋的吼声，水沫翻腾拍击震天。可怜的极地熊备受打击，徒劳无望地看着它的肢体分解为数段，无数冰块碎片随意漂浮海面，令观望者头昏目眩！由于旋风般滚动冲撞，北极熊显然已被击醒，看着海浪冲刷凶猛反复撞击，布来恩和他的藏身地看来还不算太糟。

        5．绿色晶亮的海水旋风般冲回大海，裹起高低起伏的瓦楞般涌浪，皱褶交叠的湍流翻飞，漩涡急遽堆成千形百状，实在可与世间最为精湛的雕刻竟相媲美。大理石缎面的海水线条奇异，光怪陆离的色泽或晦或明，变幻多端的繁杂花式恍如鬼斧神工。大自然绝不是单色调画家，不过将她手中璀璨宝石撒向天空，随意勾抹轻挑，于是，繁复缤纷的浅灰、翡翠、湛蓝随即幻化成漫天遮地的七彩霓虹。

        6．近点、再近点，我们尽可能大胆地靠近那座高耸的冰山，感到欣喜的是，终于看到一幕长久期待并可近距离观察的自然奇观：气势磅礴的爆炸，庞大冰块崩裂后从高空倾泻，类似大瀑布飞涌直落而下，激起震天回响；海水飞旋地直冲冰山冠顶，迸射出火花闪烁的水沫飘洒。不妨想想旁观者的内心震撼，那悬崖峭壁的冰山上端，訇然巨响纷纷炸裂，在我们眼前上演着气势恢弘的一幕冰川雪崩，令人惊悚不已。

        7．长长水流落进黑黝黝的海水，瓷玉般峭壁和琉璃冰雕不住地直泻而下，那是大自然恐怖无言的隆重洗礼。顷刻间崩塌停止，继而又周转复始，伴随炫目泛光的粼粼海水；庞大无比的冰川轮廓再度隆起，随即喷涌而出新一轮精灵古怪的冰雕峭壁，有佛龛，有露台，有洞穴，向上，向上，不停地向上，愈升愈高，在壮阔无比的冰川上纵横交错，通体沐浴在美仑美奂的滚动晶莹中。山峰过了，山脊过了，山巅亦过了，所有山体在扑面而来的风中歪扭着渐移渐远。此刻冰川又一次停止凌空翻卷，旋即又崩裂、乍裂、再崩裂，轰鸣的叹息裹杂刺耳雷吼，经久不停，错落不息，宛如威力无比的炮弹砰然引爆，撒下数以百万计金光摇曳的碎片。那一幕幕勾魂动魄的恐惧，演绎出辽阔壮观的自然奇迹。我们无法抑制情感，迸发出一声声呼天长啸，在极地的辽阔长空久久回旋。





        LESSON 57





ABOUT QUAIL


        鹌 鹑

        William Post Hawes (b. 1803, d.1842) was born in New York City. and was a graduate of Columbia College. He was a lawyer by profession. His writings consist mainly of essays, contributed to various newspapers and magazines, and show great descriptive power. He was a frequent contributor to the “Spirit of the Times,” under the title of “Cypress, Jr.,” on various sporting topics. After his death a collection of his writings was published in two volumes, entitled, “Sporting Scenes” and “Sundry Sketches.”





        1. The quail is peculiarly a domestic bird, and is attached to his birthplace and the home of his forefathers. The various members of the aquatic[73] families educate their children in the cool summer of the far north, and bathe their warm bosoms in July in the iced waters of Hudson Bay; but when Boreas[74] scatters the rushes where they had builded their bedchambers, they desert their fatherland, and fly to disport in the sunny waters of the south.

        2. The songsters of the woodland, when their customary crops of insects and berries are cut off in the fall, gather themselves to renew their loves and get married in more genial climes. Presently, the groves so vocal[75], and the sky so full, shall be silent and barren. The “melancholy days” will soon be here; only thou, dear Bob White, wilt remain.

        3. The quail is the bird for me. He is no rover, no emigrant. He stays at home, and is identified[76] with the soil. Where the farmer works, he lives, and loves, and whistles. In budding springtime, and in scorching summer—in bounteous autumn, and in barren winter, his voice is heard from the same bushy hedge fence, and from his customary cedars. Cupidity[77] and cruelty may drive him to the woods, and to seek more quiet seats; but be merciful and kind to him, and he will visit your barnyard, and sing for you upon the boughs of the apple tree by your gateway.

        4. When warm May first wooes the young flowers to open and receive her breath, then begin the cares and responsibilities of wedded life. Away fly the happy pair to seek some grassy tussock[78], where, safe from the eye of the hawk and the nose of the fox, they may rear their expectant brood in peace.

        5. Oats harvest arrives, and the fields are waving with yellow grain. Now be wary, O kind-hearted cradler[79], and tread not into those pure white eggs ready to burst with life! Soon there is a peeping sound heard, and lo! a proud mother walketh magnificently in the midst of her children, scratching and picking, and teaching them how to swallow. Happy she, if she may be permitted to bring them up to maturity, and uncompelled to renew her joys in another nest.





              6. The assiduities of a mother have a beauty and a sacredness about them that command respect and reverence in all animal nature, human or inhuman—what a lie does that word carry—except, perhaps, in monsters, insects, and fish. I never yet heard of the parental tenderness of a trout, eating up his little baby, nor of the filial gratitude of a spider, nipping the life out of his gray-headed father, and usurping[80] his web.

        7. But if you would see the purest, the sincerest, the most affecting[81] piety of a parent’s love, startle a young family of quails, and watch the conduct of the mother. She will not leave you. No, not she. But she will fall at your feet, uttering a noise which none but a distressed mother can make, and she will run, and flutter, and seem to try to be caught, and cheat your outstretched hand, and affect to be wing-broken and wounded, and yet have just strength to tumble along, until she has drawn you, fatigued, a safe distance from her threatened children and the young hopes of her heart; and then will she mount, whirring with glad strength, and away through the maze of trees you have not seen before, like a close-shot bullet, fly to her skulking infants,



              8. Listen now. Do you hear those three half-plaintive notes, quickly and clearly poured out? She is calling the boys and girls together. She sings not now “Bob White!” nor “Ah! Bob White!” That is her husband’s love call, or his trumpet blast of defiance. But she calls sweetly and softly for her lost children. Hear them “Peep! peep! peep!” at the welcome voice of their mother’s love! They are coming together. Soon the whole family will meet again.

        9. It is a foul sin to disturb them; but retread your devious[82] way, and let her hear your coming footsteps, breaking down the briers, as you renew the danger. She is quiet. Not a word is passed between the fearful fugitives. Now, if you have the heart to do it, lie low, keep still, and imitate the call of the hen quail. O mother! mother! how your heart would die if you could witness the deception! The little ones raise up their trembling heads, and catch comfort and imagined safety from the sound. “Peep! peep!” They come to you, straining their little eyes, and, clustering together and answering, seem to say, “Where is she? Mother! mother! we are here!”

        威廉 · 波斯特 · 霍伊斯（1803～1842）出生于美国纽约市，毕业于哥伦比亚大学，职业为专业律师，其主要作品包括为各类报纸杂志撰写的短文。霍伊斯极具描述才华，常以“小柏树”为笔名，给《时代精神》提供各类体育题材稿件。他的作品在他逝世后编撰为两集出版，题名为《运动现场》和《杂碎拼图》。





        1.鹌鹑为一种典型的家常鸟类，依恋滞留繁衍地或长久栖息地。这种禽类大多栖水而生，在遥远北方的凉爽夏季孵化幼仔，然后飞去哈德逊湾冰水里消退七月炎热。一旦朔风卷起枯枝败叶，当初鹌鹑以此垒巢建窝，然后，它们就会离开父辈领地，飞去温暖南方的水湄地带过冬。

        2．秋天，以昆虫和莓子为生的鹌鹑，一旦田间农作物被砍倒后，这些丛林歌手们便会麇集成群，重新开始新的爱恋，在更为温和的气候里求偶交配。很快，果园树林里鸟声鸣啾不断，天空清澈空旷。忧郁哀愁的日子不久将要降临，唯有你，亲爱的鲍勃·怀特仍会盘桓不去。

        3．鹌鹑是我的鸟。它并非流浪汉，亦不是迁徙者。它习惯待在熟悉的地方，它离不开土地。农夫们下地干活，它在田间地头栖息、爱恋、玩耍。季节流转，无论在含苞欲放的春天，骄阳似火的夏季，还是丰收喜悦的秋天，万木肃杀的寒冬；无论在浓密灌丛上空，或树篱栅栏周围，或常见的香柏树枝头，鹌鹑鸣啾声声不绝于耳，贪婪残忍的人们或许将它们驱赶到森林荒野，它们只能寻求更为僻静的地方，如果人们仁慈友好地对待它们，鹌鹑将飞抵农家谷仓，在农家院门口的苹果树枝干上尽情鸣唱。



              4．五月明媚的阳光，鹌鹑首先祈求花蕾怒放，它们才能接受花朵的温馨抚爱，然后开始履行婚姻生活的责任。年轻鹌鹑双宿双飞到处寻找茂密的草丛，在那里它们才能逃避猛鸷的利爪袭击，才能躲过嗅觉灵敏的狐狸，安心舒适地孵化自己的宝贝。

        5. 燕麦收获的季节到了，田野里落满金黄的谷粒。鹌鹑觉得还是要谨慎为妙。噢，善良的摇篮母亲，绝不会踩踏纯净洁白的蛋，那些即将叽喳欲出的生命！很快，“唧唧”声愈发清晰，瞧！肩负生命重大意义的骄傲母亲，在孩子们中间踱步，不时地为它们抓挠啄理，教它们如何吞咽。如果她能将幼雏培养长大，无需被迫重新垒窝筑巢，即可再度开始母亲的快乐，那么，她该有多么幸福自在！



        6．母亲勤勉意味对子女爱恋与神圣职责，这一信仰支撑她尊重敬畏所有动物的天性，人类或非人类皆然。或许，除了怪兽、昆虫或鱼类并不具备。我未曾听说有似水柔情的鳟鱼父母，它们能吃光自己的宝贝；亦未曾听说有孝顺感恩的蜘蛛，那些能咬死垂老的父母，从而占据它们的窝。那么，天性，这个词究竟显示什么？



        7．但是，如果你觉察到父母对子女纯粹真挚及感人至深的眷爱，势必惊讶于鹌鹑的幼小家庭，不妨看看鹌鹑母亲的所作所为吧。她不会丢下子女逃之夭夭，决不！她会假装落到人们脚边，发出母亲的唯一痛苦声音。她同时奔跑，一边拍动双翼，似乎即将被人捉住。她会欺骗你张开手掌，假装它的翅膀断了或受伤，甚至费劲地一路翻滚，直到把你折磨得筋疲力尽，将你从她受到生命威胁的孩子处成功引开，这才是她的希望所在。然后，她最终就呼啦啦快乐地飞走，飞进那些你不曾知晓的树林深处，飞去她潜藏孩子的地方，像近距离射出的子弹，倏尔不知所终。

        8．听！你听见那三声近乎悲痛哀伤、急速清晰的倾诉心声吗？她在呼唤她的儿女聚拢一起。此刻，她不是鸣啾“鲍勃 · 怀特”，亦不是“啊！鲍勃 · 怀特”，那是她配偶的爱称，或是他挑衅反抗的恶言相向。她会甜蜜轻柔地呼唤她走失的孩子们，它们则“唧唧！唧唧！唧唧！”地叫个不停，回应母亲的爱恋欢腾。全家聚在一起，终于，它们重新团圆了。

        9．倘若有人怀着狡猾奸诈之心、踏上邪恶之路去惊扰那些鹌鹑，鹌鹑母亲能听到人们走近的危险脚步，听到人们踩倒周围荆棘的声音，她只是一声不吭。在充满恐惧的逃亡者中间，不存在任何语言交流。假若有人有心，不妨蹲下，保持沉默，模仿母鹌鹑的叫声。噢，妈妈！妈妈！一旦目睹自己的无耻欺诈，你的心会死吗？那些小鹌鹑们会抬起它们惊颤的头寻求安抚，寻求来自呼唤声中的想象安全。“唧唧！唧唧”，它们会靠近你，晃动它们尚未完全睁开的眼睛，簇拥成团地叫着，似乎在说，“你在哪里？妈妈！妈妈！我们在这里！”





        LESSON 58





THE BLUE AND THE GRAY


        蓝与灰

        1. By the flow of the inland river,

        Whence the fleets of iron have fled,

        Where the blades of the grave grass quiver,

        Asleep are the ranks of the dead;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Under the one, the Blue;

         Under the other, the Gray.





        2. These, in the robings of glory,

        Those, in the gloom of defeat,

        All, with the battle blood gory,

        In the dusk of eternity meet;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Under the laurel, the Blue;

         Under the willow, the Gray.

        3. From the silence of sorrowful hours,

        The desolate mourners go,

        Lovingly laden with flowers,

        Alike for the friend and the foe;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Under the roses, the Blue;

         Under the lilies, the Gray.





        4. So, with an equal splendor,

        The morning sun rays fall,

         With a touch, impartially tender,

        On the blossoms blooming for all;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Broidered with gold, the Blue;

         Mellowed with gold, the Gray.





              5. So, when the summer calleth,

        On forest and field of grain,

        With an equal murmur falleth

        The cooling drip of the rain;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Wet with the rain, the Blue;

         Wet with the rain, the Gray.





        6. Sadly, but not with upbraiding,

        The generous deed was done:

        In the storm of the years that are fading,

        No braver battle was won;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Under the blossoms, the Blue;

         Under the garlands, the Gray.





        7. No more shall the war cry sever,

        Or the winding rivers be red;

        They banish our anger forever,

        When they laurel the graves of our dead;—

         Under the sod and the dew,

         Waiting the judgment day;

        Love and tears, for the Blue;

         Tears and love, for the Gray.

        其实泯灭，我们心中仇恨永远。

        草地下，露水下，

        等待着，最后审判日，

        爱，还有眼泪，归于蓝色，

        眼泪，还有爱，归于灰色。





        （F. M.芬奇）





        LESSON 59





THE MACHINIST’S RETURN


        回家之路

        [Adapted from a letter written by a correspondent of the Washington “Capital.”]





        1. On our way from Springfield to Boston, a stout, black-whiskered man sat immediately in front of me, in the drawing-room car, whose maneuvers[83] were a source of constant amusement. He would get up every five minutes, hurry away to the narrow passage leading to the door of the car, and commence laughing in the most violent manner, continuing that healthful exercise until he observed that some one was watching him, when he would return to his seat.

        2. As we neared Boston these demonstrations[84] increased in frequency and violence, but the stranger kept his seat and chuckled to himself. He shifted the position of his two portmanteaus[85], or placed them on the seat as if he was getting ready to leave. As we were at least twenty-five miles from Boston, such early preparations seemed extremely ridiculous. He became so excited at last that he could not keep his secret. Some one must be made a confidant[86]; and as I happened to be the nearest to him, he selected me.

        3. Turning around suddenly, and rocking himself to and fro in his chair, he said, “I have been away from home three years. Have been in Europe. My folks don’t expect me for three months yet, but I got through and started. I telegraphed them at the last station —they’ve got the dispatch[87] by this time.” As he said this he rubbed his hands, and changed the portmanteau on his left to the right, and then the one on the right to the left.

        4. “Have you a wife?” said I. “Yes, and three children,” was the answer. He then got up and folded his overcoat anew, and hung it over the back of the seat. “You are somewhat nervous just now, are you not?” said I.

        5. “Well, I should think so,” he replied. “I have n’t slept soundly for a week. Do you know,” he went on, speaking in a low tone, “I am almost certain this train will run off the track and break my neck before I get to Boston. I have had too much good luck lately for one man. It can’t last. It rains so hard, sometimes, that you think it’s never going to stop; then it shines so bright you think it’s always going to shine; and just as you are settled in either belief, you are knocked over by a change, to show you that you know nothing about it.”

        6. “Well, according to your philosophy[88],” I said, “you will continue to have sunshine because you are expecting a storm.” “Perhaps so,” he replied; “but it is curious that the only thing which makes me think I shall get through safe is, I fear that I shall not.”



              7. “I am a machinist[89],” he continued; “I made a discovery; nobody believed in it; I spent all my money in trying to bring it out; I mortgaged[90] my home—everything went. Everybody laughed at me—everybody but my wife. She said she would work her fingers off before I should give it up. I went to England. At first I met with no encouragement whatever, and came very near jumping off London Bridge. I went into a workshop to earn money enough to come home with: there I met the man I wanted. To make a long story short, I’ve brought home ￡50,000 with me, and here I am.”

        8. “Good!” I exclaimed. “Yes,” said he, “and the best of it is, she knows nothing about it. She has been disappointed so often that I concluded I would not write to her about my unexpected good luck. When I got my money, though, I started for home at once.”

        9. “And now, I suppose, you will make her happy?” “Happy!” he replied; “why, you don’t know anything about it! She’s worked night and day since I have been in England, trying to support herself and the children decently. They paid her thirteen cents apiece for making shirts, and that’s the way she has lived half the time. She’ll come down to the depot to meet me in a gingham[91] dress and a shawl a hundred years old, and she’ll think she’s dressed up! Perhaps she won’t have any fine dresses in a week or so, eh?”

        10. The stranger then strode down the passageway again, and getting in a corner where he seemed to suppose that he was out of sight, went through the strangest pantomime[92],—laughing,putting his mouth into the drollest shapes, and swinging himself back and forth in the limited space.

        11. As the train was going into the depot, I placed myself on the platform of the car in front of the one in which I had been riding, and opposite the stranger, who, with a portmanteau in each hand, was standing on the lowest step, ready to jump to the ground. I looked from his face to the faces of the people before us, but saw no sign of recognition. Suddenly he cried, “There they are!”

        12. Then he laughed outright, but in a hysterical[93] way, as he looked over the crowd in front of him. I followed his eye and saw, some distance back, as if crowded out by the well-dressed and elbowing throng, a little woman in a faded dress and a well-worn hat, with a face almost painful in its intense but hopeful expression, glancing rapidly from window to window as the coaches passed by.

        13. She had not seen the stranger, but a moment after she caught his eye. In another instant he had jumped to the platform with his two portmanteaus, and, pushing his way through the crowd, he rushed towards the place where she was standing. I think I never saw a face assume so many different expressions in so short a time as did that of the little woman while her husband was on his way to meet her.

        14. She was not pretty,—on the contrary, she was very plain-looking; but somehow I felt a big lump rise in my throat as I watched her. She was trying to laugh, but, God bless her, how completely she failed in the attempt! Her mouth got into the position to laugh, but it never moved after that, save to draw down at the corners and quiver, while her eyes blinked so fast that I suspect she only caught occasional glimpses of the broad-shouldered fellow who elbowed his way so rapidly toward her.



              15. As he drew close, and dropped the portmanteaus, she turned to one side, and covered her face with her hands; and thus she was when the strong man gathered her up in his arms as if she were a child, and held her sobbing to his breast.

        16. There were enough staring at them, heaven knows; so I turned my eyes away a moment, and then I saw two boys in threadbare roundabouts standing near, wiping their eyes on their sleeves, and bursting into tears anew at every fresh demonstration on the part of their mother. When I looked at the stranger again he had his hat drawn over his eyes; but his wife was looking up at him, and it seemed as if the pent-up tears of those weary months of waiting were streaming through her eyelids.

        1．我们坐在一辆从斯普林菲尔德开往波士顿火车的卧铺车厢里，一位壮硕结实、长有黑色胡须的男子恰好坐在我前面，他的搞笑动作成为车厢笑料不断的来源。他总会每隔五分钟站起，匆忙离开座位，跑向通向车厢门边的过道，然后，肆无忌惮地开怀大笑，直到觉察有人关注他，才会结束这种健康练习，返回他的座位。

        2．当火车接近波士顿，男人表演的频率增加，甚至举止更为疯狂；一旦坐下，那男人兀自咯咯地笑着，不停挪动自己两只旅行箱的位置，或干脆将其放在座位上，似乎马上他就会离开。当时，我们离波士顿最少还有二十五英里，如此早就做下车准备，看来太滑稽好笑。最后他愈加激动，好像非得找人聊天一吐为快。我碰巧坐得离他最近，亦就理所当然地成为他情感宣泄的知己。

        3．他突然转过身来，在座椅里前后摇晃地开口对我说，“我离家已经三年，一直待在欧洲。我的老乡们三月内别指望见到我了，不过，我与他们已打过招呼了。我在最后离开的站台上与他们通过话，现在，他们想必接到我的快件了。”他一边说，一边搓着手，然后将左手的旅行箱放到右边，右边的换到左边。



        4．“你有妻子么？”我问他。“有，还有三个孩子。”他回答，他接着站了起来，再次折叠起他的外套，将其搭在座椅背上。“你现在有点紧张，对吗？”我又问道。

        5．“是的，确实紧张，”他告诉我，“你知道吗，一星期来，我没睡过一个安稳觉，”他继续小声地说，“我几乎确信，这列火车肯定会在抵达波士顿前脱轨，我也会扭断脖子。我的运气一直实在太好，好运气不会持久。雨下得太大时，有时，你甚至在想，雨恐怕再也不会停了;可一旦阳光灿烂，你也会想，天，总会这样一如既往地晴下去；正如你对二选一的某种信仰或概念安然若素，你就会被随后变化击垮，这些无非表明，你对这其中关系一无所知。”



              6．“那么，根据你的推理，”我说，“因为你期待暴风雨的来临，说明你想继续拥有阳光。”“或许如此，”他说，“不过，这事看来让人好奇，唯一使我考虑的，最终我会安全无恙，当然，我也恐怕不能过关。”

        7．“我是个机械师，”他继续说，“我推出一项发明，但无人相信，我花完了所有的钱，试图将这一发现公布于众。我将自己的房子做了抵押，所有财产都没了，人人都嘲笑我，当然不包括我的妻子。她说在我放弃之前，她得拼命干活。后来，我去了英国。刚开始，无论我做什么，都没有任何转机，还差点从伦敦桥上跳下去。再后来，我又去了家工厂，赚足能带回家的钱，就在那里，我遇见了希望见到的人。长话短说，我这次带回五万英镑，喏，情况就是这样。”

        8．“很好，”我叫了起来。“是的，”他说，“最好的是，我老婆压根不知道这些。她一直很沮丧，所以，我决定不写信告诉她我走了天大的好运，尽管一拿到钱，我立马准备回家。”

        9．“那么，现在，你会使她幸福吗？”“当然！”他回答，“哎呀，你什么也不知道！自从我去英国后，她从早到晚干活支撑这个家，想让孩子们活得更好些。她加工每件衬衫只能拿十三美分的报酬，那就是她上半辈子的活命方式。她会穿着一身粗布衣衫，戴条怕有百年光景的破围巾来车站接我。她觉得，她穿得不错了，或许一周左右，她根本不会买好点的衣服，呃？”

        10．陌生人随后又迈步走向过道，蜷缩到一处拐角，或许他觉得这样做，别人才无法看见他，接着又开始表演哑剧——大笑，用嘴做出各种搞笑怪状，在并不宽敞的空间前后摇晃不停。

        11．当火车驶入车站后，我下了车，站在我刚坐的那列火车卧铺车厢前面月台上，与那位陌生人对面相望。他一手拎一件行李箱，站在最下一层车厢阶梯，正欲跳到地上。我的目光从他的脸庞，再移到我们之间人群的脸上，一切安然正常。他冷不丁地高喊：“他们在那！”

        12．巡睃着前方人群，他忽然大笑起来，简直有点歇斯底里地狂笑。我随着他的目光这才看见，一段距离开外，站着一位矮小女子，衣着一身破旧衣衫，头上帽子龌龊不堪，那女子被周围衣着华丽的人流推搡着，那张在紧张与渴望交集中几乎痛苦变形的脸，急速张望那一节节驶过的车厢。

        13．她没有看到那位陌生人，但很快，他终于看见她了，他顿时跳下车，一路拼命地穿过拥挤的人群跑向站台，手里还提着两个皮箱。他冲向她站立的地方。当丈夫一路跑去，妻子脸上霎时出现繁杂难言的表情，我还从未见过这种场面。





              14．她不漂亮——相反，她的姿色实在庸常，但不知怎么，看着她，我心中哽咽异常。那女人想笑，可上帝保佑，她却一点没笑出来，她的嘴准备笑的姿态，突然竟僵在那里，她的脸部嘴角肌肉亦没有颤抖，只是快速地眨动眼睛。我估计，人潮汹涌中的她需要费力才能看清那个熟悉的身影，那个有着宽阔肩膀的男人此刻正拼命地挤开人群，快步朝她跑去。

        15．当他跑到跟前，扔下行李箱，她转过身子，用手捂住脸，那壮实的男人一把将她像孩子般搂进怀里，将她哭泣的脸贴在他的胸前。

        16．两人凝视了很久很久，天知道！我转身片刻，随后注意到他们身旁环状交叉路口边，站着两个衣衫褴褛的男孩，仔细地看着妈妈的一举一动，孩子们一边用袖口擦拭眼睛，一边嚎啕大哭。当我再度打量那位陌生人，他已将帽檐拉下遮住眼睛；而他的妻子正仰脸看着他，似乎疲惫等待岁月中压抑经久的情感爆发，滚滚热泪潸然而下。





        LESSON 60





MAKE WAY FOR LIBERTY


        请给自由让路

        James Montgomery (b. 1771, d. 1854) was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland. His father, a Moravian preacher, sent him to a Moravian school at Fulneck, Yorkshire, England, to be educated. In 1794 he started “The Sheffield Iris,” a weekly paper, which he edited, with marked ability, till 1825. He was fined and imprisoned twice for publishing articles decided to be seditious. His principal poetical works are “The World before the Flood,” “Greenland,” “The West Indies,” “The Wanderer in Switzerland,” “The Pelican Island,” and “Original Hymns, for Public, Private, and Social Devotion.” Mr. Montgomery’s style is generally too diffuse; but its smoothness and the evident sincerity of his emotions have made many of his hymns and minor poems very popular. A pension of ￡300 a year was granted to him in 1833.





        1. “Make way for Liberty!” he cried;

        Made way for Liberty, and died!





        2. In arms the Austrian phalanx[94] stood,

        A living wall, a human wood!

        A wall, where every conscious[95] stone

        Seemed to its kindred[96] thousands grown;

        A rampart[97] all assaults to bear,

        Till time to dust their frames should wear

        A wood like that enchanted grove,

        In which, with fiends, Rinaldo strove,

        Where every silent tree possessed

        A spirit prisoned in its breast,

        Which the first stroke of coming strife

        Would startle into hideous life:

        So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,

        A living wall, a human wood!





        3. Impregnable[98] their front appears,

        All horrent[99] with projected spears,



              Whose polished points before them shine,

        From flank to flank, one brilliant line,

        Bright as the breakers’ splendors run

        Along the billows to the sun.

        4. Opposed to these, a hovering band,

        Contending for their native laud;

        Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke

        From manly necks the ignoble yoke,

        And forged their fetters into swords,

        On equal terms to fight their lords;

        And what insurgent[100] rage had gained,

        In many a mortal fray maintained:

        Marshaled once more at Freedom’s call,

        They came to conquer or to fall,

        Where he who conquered, he who fell.

        Was deemed a dead or living Tell!





        5. And now the work of life and death

        Hung on the passing of a breath;

        The fire of conflict burned within;

        The battle trembled to begin;

        Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,

        Point for attack was nowhere found;

        Where’er the impatient Switzers gazed,

        The unbroken line of lances blazed;

        That line ’t were suicide to meet,

        And perish at their tyrants’ feet;

        How could they rest within their graves,

        And leave their homes the home of slaves?

        Would they not feel their children tread

        With clanking chains above their head?





        6. It must not be: this day, this hour,

        Annihilates[101] the oppressor’s power

        All Switzerland is in the field,

        She will not fly, she can not yield;

        Few were the numbers she could boast,

        But every freeman was a host,

        And felt as though himself were he

        On whose sole arm hung victory.





        7. It did depend on one, indeed:

        Behold him! Arnold Winkelried!

        There sounds not to the trump of fame



              The echo of a nobler name.

        Unmarked he stood amid the throng,

        In rumination[102] deep and long,

        Till you might see with sudden grace,

        The very thought come o’er his face;

        And by the motion of his form:

        Anticipate the bursting storm;

        And by the uplifting of his brow,

        Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.

        But ’t was no sooner thought than done;

        The field was in a moment won.

        8. “Make way for Liberty!” he cried:

        Then ran, with arms extended wide,

        As if his dearest friend to clasp;

        Ten spears he swept within his grasp:

        “Make way for Liberty!” he cried,

        Their keen points met from side to side;

        He bowed among them like a tree,

        And thus made way for Liberty.





        9. Swift to the breach[103] his comrades fly;

        “Make way for Liberty!” they cry,

        And through the Austrian phalanx dart,

        As rushed the spears through Arnold’s heart;

        While instantaneous as his fall,

        Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all.

        An earthquake could not overthrow

        A city with a surer blow.





        10. Thus Switzerland again was free,

        Thus Death made way for Liberty!

        1．“请给自由让路！”他高声叫道。

        不自由，毋宁死！





        2．面对奥匈帝国荷枪实弹的士兵，

        一座呼吸的墙，一道生命的丛林。

        墙上， 紧密挽手的每块石头，

        绵亘着，成千上万的意志凝聚，

        血肉之躯，勇猛地抵御外来进攻，

        抵命而立，直到时间将其蹂躏成灰。

        树林，仿佛施以魔鬼般梦魇，

        恶魔，肆无忌惮地施虐横行，

        每一棵树，沉默中的丰饶活力，

        精神， 囚禁于肉体的牢笼藩篱。

        转瞬将至，第一次生死关头，

        惊悚于，卑劣的残忍屠戮，

        奥匈队列，沉默冷酷密不透风，

        一座呼吸的墙，一道生命的丛林！





        3．奥匈军队列，坚不可摧，

        无数枝，毛骨悚然的枪矛竖起，

        刀尖锃亮，阳光下刺眼夺目，

        排列齐整，彰显出威严武力，

        犹如无数，细碎浪花的翻腾奔涌，

        扑向太阳，血色天空中一抹瑰丽。





        4．大战当前，高昂的群情激奋，

        高声讴歌，民族奋起的精神 ，

        农家子弟， 潜在力量訇然爆发，

        男子汉脖颈，留有奴隶的卑微印记，

        赋权平等， 为心中的耶和华上帝，

        将身上锁链，锻造成刀剑锐利无比。

        愤怒之火，在起义者心中早已点燃，



              维系着， 以死抗争的不灭信念。

        自由在召唤，队伍再度整齐，

        征服敌人，抑或裹尸疆场，

        厮杀声中站立，呐喊声里倒毙，

        视死如归，生者死者的袒露秘密。





        5．生存抑或死亡，命悬一线，

        成功还是败馁，须臾之间，

        怒火满腔， 迸发出燃烧火焰，

        战栗的战斗， 哗啦啦拉开序幕，

        顽强抵抗， 奥匈军固守脚下阵地，

        刀剑出鞘， 起义军旋即难觅锋芒，

        焦虑的反抗者，如何突出重围？

        长矛连绵， 铮铮寒光凛冽，

        风卷残云， 他们纷纷拔剑自刎，

        最终倒下，暴君脚下的血泊成河。

        墓穴里， 死者何以超脱永久安息？

        能否忍受， 子孙后代受尽奴役？

        如何忍受， 孩子们脚上铁镣叮当，

        在他们头顶， 整夜徘徊终日难去？





        6．这一日子，这一时刻，

        未必所有瑞士人，都能

        义无反顾地揭竿起义，

        但他们绝不逃避或臣服；

        尽管能夸耀的英雄不多，

        但所有人都是土地的主人。

        国家解放，在于个体奋起，

        民族独立，人民需拿起武器。





        7．胜利，的确依赖优异个体，

        看！ 阿诺德 · 里德激战那里！

        听起来，原非什么显赫背景，



              风中传扬，一个高山仰止的名字，

        回首往事，沉思漫长犀利，

        拥挤人群里，他默默无人注意，

        或许，突然间他的魅力四射，

        电花火石，脸上闪烁睿智，

        他英勇善战，预测战局的进展，

        他双眉坚毅，运筹帷幄的指挥，

        他告诉士兵，如何放弩攻击，

        横扫入侵者，千军风卷残云。

        电闪雷鸣，不过转瞬之间，

        阵地上，胜利的旗帜随风飘扬。





        8．“请给自由让路！”他高声叫道。

        奔跑中，他伸开无穷宽阔的臂膀，

        哪怕，与亲密的朋友拥抱握手，

        铁肩横扫，亦能抓过众多矛枪。

        “请给自由让路！”声音继续回响，

        枪尖锐利，严阵以待的对垒双方，

        他躬身如巨椽，伫立士兵中间，

        力拔千钧，为获取自由疾奔。





         9．进军神速，士兵们英勇异常，

        “请给自由让路！”众人异口同声，

        他们呼啸着，冲进奥匈军队，

        疾驰飞镖，刺中阿诺德的心脏，

        他猝然倒下，倒在那片深情土地。

        溃败毁灭恐慌，不断蔓延滋长，

        即使天崩地裂，亦无法

        让普罗大众，如此黯然神伤。





        10．瑞士人，终于重获民族解放，

        死亡， 毕竟为自由敞开道路！





        LESSON 61





THE ENGLISH SKYLARK


        英国云雀

        Elihu Burritt (b. 1810, d. 1879). “the learned blacksmith,” was born in New Britain, Conn. His father was a shoemaker. Having received only a limited amount of instruction at the district school, he was apprenticed to a blacksmith about 1827. During his apprenticeship he labored hard at self-instruction. He worked at his trade many years, from ten to twelve hours each day, but managed, in the meantime to acquire a knowledge of many ancient and modern languages. He made translations from several of these, which were published in the “American Eclectic Review.” In 1844 he commenced the publication of “The Christian Citizen.” His leading literary works are “Sparks from the Anvil,” “A Voice from the Forge,” “Peace Papers,” and “Walks to John o’ Groat’s House.” From the last of these the following selection is abridged.





        1. Take it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals the English lark in heart or voice, for both unite to make it the sweetest, the happiest, the welcomest singer that was ever winged, like the high angels of God’s love. It is the living ecstasy[104] of joy when it mounts up into its “glorious privacy of light.”

        2. On the earth it is timid, silent, and bashful, as if not at home, and not sure of its right to be there at all. It is rather homely withal, having nothing in feather, feature,or form to attract notice. It is seemingly made to be heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom[105] addressed to children when getting noisy.

        3. Its mission is music, and it floods a thousand acres of the blue sky with it several times a day. Out of that palpitating[106] speck of living joy there wells[107] forth a sea of twittering ecstasy upon the morning and evening air. It does not ascend by gyrations[108], like the eagle and birds of prey. It mounts up like a human aspiration.

        4. It seems to spread its wings and to be lifted straight upwards out of sight by the afflatus[109] of its own happy heart. To pour out this in undulating [110]rivulets of rhapsody[111] is apparently the only motive of its ascension. This it is that has made it so loved of all generations[112].

        5. It is the singing angel of man’s nearest heaven, whose vital breath is music. Its sweet warbling is only the metrical[113] palpitation of its life of joy. It goes up over the rooftrees[114] of the rural hamlet[115] on the wings of its song, as if to train the human soul to trial flights heavenward.



              6. Never did the Creator put a voice of such volume into so small a living thing. It is a marvel—almost a miracle. In a still hour you can hear it at nearly a mile’s distance. When its form is lost in the hazy lace work of the sun’s rays above, it pours down upon you all the thrilling semitones of its song as distinctly as if it were warbling to you in your window.

        伊利户 · 巴瑞特(1810～1879)，这位“有学问的铁匠”出生于美国康涅狄格州新不列颠市，父亲是位制鞋匠，他在当地学校接受的教育极为有限。1827年前后，他成为铁匠铺一名学徒，学徒期间，尽管每天劳作辛苦，他仍然坚持自学。他经营打铁营生多年，尽管每天工作时间长达10～12小时，却想方设法努力自学多门古今语言知识。他曾从事数种语言翻译，这些译文以《美国折中学派评论》为题续集出版。1844年，他开始着手出版《基督徒公民》。他的文学代表作品有《来自铁砧的火花》、《铁匠铺的声音》、《和平论文》和《走向约翰•格罗特的府宅》，以下章节节选自最后一篇。





        1．就秉性和声音而言，从南北半球鸟类来看，没有任何一种鸟能与英国云雀相媲美。英国云雀具有两者相得益彰的优秀禀赋，因此成为有史以来有翼物种中最可爱、最快乐、亦是最受欢迎的歌手，犹如上帝钟爱的空中天使。当云雀振翼飞向自己“荣耀之光的隐居”，意味着它追求尘世生活的心醉神迷的世俗幸福。

        2．地球上的鸟类中，英国云雀胆怯安静、腼腆害羞，倘若不在巢穴，人们压根不会感到它的存在。英国云雀隶属家常鸟类，其羽毛、秉性或吸引异类的方式并无任何特异。云雀不过宣泄歌声，并非展示其容貌，这一观点其实颠覆了不言而喻的真相，类似大人们眼中吵闹的孩子印象。

        3．吟唱乃云雀的生活使命，它每天数次飞掠上千英亩范围的蓝空。除却快乐引起心悸颤抖，从早到晚，云雀幸福的鸣啾随风传来，丝缕不绝。云雀并非像鹰类或其他猛禽盘旋地飞上高空，而是如同人类的呼吸吐纳。

        4．云雀似乎张开翅膀，凭借内心愉悦气息，便可径直飞腾向上，飞出人们的视线之外，犹如一条峰回路转的湍急溪流，显然可见，这种气息吐纳为云雀起飞中唯一运动。这也是云雀备受历代人们追捧的缘故。

        5．英国云雀是人类最接近天堂的吟唱天使，它的呼吸气息谱写出优美音符，它的柔美颤声来自欣喜中悸动的心中旋律，乘着歌声的翅膀，云雀高高地盘旋在乡村农舍的屋顶，似乎激励人类飞向天空的梦幻翱翔。



              6．造物主从未将如此天籁施加这样弱小的生灵。云雀昭示一种生物特异，近似一个完美奇迹。万籁静谧，你甚至可以听见几乎一英里之外云雀的悦耳歌声。阳光穿过云层泻下，雾霭朦胧一片，洇成天空璀璨花边，云雀身影隐去不见，然而，它的半音程颤音清新婉转，宛如立在你的窗前为你鸣啾歌唱。

HOW SLEEP THE BRAVE


        勇士如何安睡

        William Collins (b. 1721, d. 1759) was born at Chichester, England. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1745, he went to London as a literary adventurer, and there won the esteem of Dr. Johnson. His “Odes” were published in 1746, but were not popular. He was subsequently relieved from pecuniary embarrassment by a legacy of ￡2,000 from a maternal uncle; but he soon became partially insane, and was for some time confined in an asylum for lunatics. He afterwards retired to Chichester, where he was cared for by his sister until his death.





        1. How sleep the brave who sink to rest

        By all their country’s wishes blessed!

        When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,

        Returns to deck their hallowed mold,

        She there shall dress a sweeter sod

        Than Fancy’s feet have ever trod.

        2. By fairy hands their knell is rung;

        By forms unseen their dirge is sung;

        There honor comes a pilgrim gray,

        To bless the turf that wraps their clay;

        And Freedom shall awhile repair

        To dwell a weeping hermit there!

        威廉 · 柯林斯（1721～1759）出生于英国奇切斯特，他曾在温彻斯特和牛津接受教育。1745年左右，他赴伦敦试图在文学上找到发展机会，在那里赢得了约翰逊博士的关注。1746年，他的《诗歌集》出版，但该书反响不大。随后，柯林斯先生因继承舅父2000英镑的遗产馈赠而结束经济窘困，不过很快又因患间歇性癫狂症，一度曾因精神错乱在收容所滞留。他退休后返回奇切斯特出生地，起居生活由他的妹妹照料，直到他最后离世。

        轻轻地，将魂灵皮囊精心描绘。

        弹指间，笑盈盈草地嫣红绽绿，

        硝烟尽，桃花落，转眼人间仙境。





        2．彩弦声声，谁愿将哀伤奏与后人？

        蓦然回首，春风破哪首挽歌翻舞？

        如今荣耀，照亮朝圣者晦暗墓穴，

        青山千古，早捻碎铮铮铁骨入土。

        春寒料峭，英雄豪情斯人已远去，

        壮志未酬，长歌当哭漫漫自由路。

THE RAINBOW


        彩 虹

         John Keble (b. 1792. d. 1866) was born near Fairfax, Gloucestershire, England. He graduated at Oxford with remarkably high honors, and afterwards was appointed to the professorship of poetry in that university. Since his death, Keble College, at Oxford, has been erected to his memory. In 1835, he became vicar of Hursley and rector of Otterbourne, and held these livings until his death. His most famous work is “The Christian Year,” a collection of sacred poems.





        1. A fragment of a rainbow bright

        Through the moist air I see,

        All dark and damp on yonder height,

        All bright and clear to me.





        2. An hour ago the storm was here,

        The gleam was far behind;

        So will our joys and grief appear,

        When earth has ceased to blind.





        3. Grief will be joy if on its edge

        Fall soft that holiest ray,

        Joy will be grief if no faint pledge

        Be there of heavenly day.

SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS


        约翰·亚当斯的假设演讲

        Daniel Webster (b. 1782, d. 1852) was born in Salisbury, N.H. He spent a few months of his boyhood at Phillips Academy, Exeter, but fitted for college under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boscawen, N.H. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1801. He taught school several terms, during and after his college course. In 1805, he was admitted to the bar in Boston, and practiced law in New Hampshire for the succeeding eleven years. In 1812, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. In 1816, he removed to Boston, and in 1827 was elected to the United States Senate, which position he held for twelve years. In 1841, he was appointed Secretary of State. He returned to the Senate in 1845. In 1850, he was reappointed Secretary of State and continued in office until his death. He died at his residence, in Marshfield, Mass. Mr. Webster’s fame rests chiefly on his state papers and speeches. As a speaker he was dignified and stately, using clear, pure English. During all his life he took great interest in agriculture, and was very fond of outdoor sports.





        1. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that, in the beginning, we aimed not at independence. But

        “There’s a divinity that shapes our ends.”

        The injustice of England has driven us to arms; and blinded to her own interest, she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now within our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why then should we defer the declaration? Is any man so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation[1] with England, which shall leave either safety to the country and its liberties, or security to his own life and his own honor! Are not you, sir, who sit in that chair, is not he, our venerable colleague[2], near you, are you not both already the proscribed[3] and predestined[4] objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off from all hope of royal clemency[5], what are you, what can you be, while the power of England remains, but outlaws?

        2. If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on, or to give up, the war? Do we mean to submit, and consent that we shall be ground to powder, and our country and its rights trodden down in the dust? I know we do not mean to submit. We NEVER shall submit! Do we intend to violate that most solemn obligation ever entered into by men, that plighting, before God, of our sacred honor to Washington, when, putting him forth to incur the dangers of war, as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised to adhere to him in every extremity with our fortunes and our lives? I know there is not a man here, who would not rather see a general conflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one jot or tittle[6] of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself, having twelve months ago, in this place, moved you that George Washington be appointed commander of the forces raised, or to be raised, for the defense of American liberty; may my right hand forget her cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver in the support I give him.



              3. The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if the war must go on, why put off the Declaration of Independence? That measure will strengthen us. It will give us character abroad. Nations will then treat with us, which they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that England herself will sooner treat for peace with us on the footing of independence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct toward us has been a course of injustice and oppression. Her pride will be less wounded by submitting to that course of things, which now predestinates our independence, than by yielding the points in controversy[7] to her rebellious subjects. The former, she would regard as the result of fortune; the latter, she would feel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then, do we not change this from a civil to a national war? And since we must fight it through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the benefits of victory, if we gain the victory.

        4. If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The cause will raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The people—the people, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry themselves, gloriously through this struggle. I care not how fickle other people have been found. I know the people of these colonies; and I know that resistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their hearts, and can not be eradicated[8]. Sir, the Declaration of Independence will inspire the people with increased courage. Instead of a long and bloody war for the restoration of privileges, for redress[9] of grievances, for chartered[10] immunities[11], held under a British king, set before them the glorious object of entire independence, and it will breathe into them anew the spirit of life.

        5. Read this declaration at the head of the army; every sword will be drawn, and the solemn vow uttered to maintain it, or perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of religious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand with it or fall with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it there; let them see it who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry out in its support.

        6. Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see—I see clearly through this day’s business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to see the time this declaration shall be made good. We may die; die colonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the scaffold. Be it so: be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a country, and that a FREE country.



              7. But whatever may be our fate, be assured—be assured that this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will richly compensate[12] for both. Through the thick gloom of the present I see the brightness of the future as the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its annual return they will shed tears,—copious, gushing tears; not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude, and of joy.

        8. Sir, before God I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves the measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God, it shall by my dying sentiment; independence now, and INDEPENDENCE FOREVER.

        丹尼尔 · 韦伯斯特(1782～1852)出生于美国新罕布什尔州索尔兹伯里。少年时期，他曾在埃克塞特菲利普斯学院学习数月，然后转学到新罕布什尔州博斯考恩牧师塞缪尔 · 伍德门下学习。1801年，他毕业于达特茅斯学院。在校期间以及毕业后，他曾在学院任教长达数学期。1805年，韦伯斯特先生获取波士顿律师资格，接着在新罕布什尔州从事律师职业长达11年。1812年，他被选为美国众议院议员；1816年迁到波士顿；1827年，他被选为美国参议院议员，随后任职长达12年。1841年，韦伯斯特先生被任命为美国国务卿；1845年他返回参议院。1850年，他再度任职美国国务卿，继续驰骋美国政坛，直到在马萨诸塞州马什菲尔德他的住所离世。韦伯斯特先生的声誉主要为他的国情咨文与演讲。他的演讲意蕴高贵，气势宏伟，语言清晰，优雅纯正。他一生极为钟爱农业，酷爱户外运动。





        1．沉沦抑或求生，活着抑或死亡，幸免抑或毁灭？我完全支持这一投票表决。诚然，最初我们并非旨在谋取独立，然而，“神灵预设了我们的终局”。英国非道义行为驱使我们拿起武器，英国盲目失去了对自身利益的判断，然而它仍在执拗坚持，直到我们最终将独立掌控在自己手中。我们只不过向前伸出手，独立就在那里，它属于我们。那么，我们为什么拖延自己宣言？目前，难道还有人如此软弱地希望与英国和解？难道和解可给这一国家带来安全或自由，抑或给他个人生活带来保障甚至个人荣誉？先生，不会是现在坐在椅子上的你，亦不是紧挨你而坐的他，我们受人尊敬的同僚，我们难道不都是已被剥夺公权，命中注定沦为惩罚与复仇的对象？摒弃那些高尚以及仁厚宽容的所有希望！一旦英国统治权威得以保留，法律之外，你是什么？你又可能是什么？



              2．如果我们推迟独立，那么我们打算继续还是放弃这场战争，开始和解且恢复我们与英国的友谊？我们将要服从甚至完全臣服于武力，目睹我们国家以及它的权利将被践踏成灰？我知道，我们不会屈服，我们永远不会屈服！难道我们准备亵渎人类始终遵从的庄严法则，面对上帝，亵渎我们面对华盛顿总统发出自己神圣荣誉的誓言？从而使他蒙受战争危险以及深陷当下的政治困局，我们难道不是曾经许诺，不管任何危难当头，我们将倾尽所有财富甚至身家性命去追随拥戴他？我清楚，在场任何人哪怕宁愿看到战争急遽爆发，战火迅速席卷北美大地，或突如其来的地震使美国坍陷，亦不愿意抛弃曾经的誓约，哪怕微小的背离反叛。对我来说，一年前假设同样在这样的场合，假设我力劝你们，为保护美国自由，乔治·华盛顿应该被任命为崛起的或有待崛起的美国抵抗力量的统帅；万一现在，我对是否支持他仍然踌躇不定，但愿我的右手受到诅咒，但愿我从此闭嘴不再说话！

        3．因此，战争必须继续。我们必须打下去。如果战争必须打下去，我们为什么拖延宣布《独立宣言》？昭示天下只会使我们强大，同时赋予我们面向外界的能力。如果我们本身认可屈从侵犯我们主权的武力，怎能指望其他国家与我们正常交往？不仅如此，我认为，在承认独立的前提下，与其说英国本身愿意与我们协商和平会谈，不如说它更为赞同废除其法案，承认它对我们施加的所有行为始终缺乏公平正义且残忍暴虐。倘若英国顺其自然，美国独立在所难免，大英帝国颜面多少得以保留；倘若英国在双方论战中屈从它的反叛者论点，情况将有所不同。前者，英国认为原本会有幸运的结局；后者，它将为此深感羞辱。既然如此，我们为何不将这场内战改为民族之战？既然必须打下去，如果我们获取胜利，为什么不愿享受胜利将给我们带来全身心的喜悦？

        4．如果我们遭受失败，对我们来说，境况绝不会更糟，然而我们不应该失败。我们将兴建自己的军队，建立自己的海军。假如我们真心对待民众，民众将支持我们，其实质就是支持他们自己，并通过战斗取得荣耀。我不介意有些人总是善变无常，我了解殖民地民众；我清楚民众对英国入侵的刻骨仇恨与反抗源自他们内心，况且仇恨不可能消弭。先生们，《独立宣言》将鼓舞民众获得勇气。这场长期流血的战争并非旨在恢复某些特权，并非为社会不公抱怨或改错纠偏，并非为获取大英国王属下控制的特许豁免权，这是一项彻底独立的宏图大业，铺展在美国民众面前，并将为其生命注入崭新灵魂的明天。

        5．请在起义前朗读这篇宣言，每一把刀剑应该出鞘，发出的神圣誓言应该兑现，否则不如畏缩于恐惧角落干脆消失。在讲坛发出誓言，教会给予认可，宗教自由的爱将与其同在，决心与誓言同存亡。在公众场合发出誓言，宣布自己决心信念，让那些民众见证，他们曾经目睹自家兄弟和孩子们倒在邦克山周围田野，倒在列克星敦市和康科德大街上，倒在众多英雄为国捐躯的众多地方。



              6．先生们，我知道人类事物的不确定因素，但是通过今天事件，我看见，不！我清楚地看见，真的，你和我，或许为此后悔，我们可能活不到《独立宣言》将给民众带来福音的那一天。我们可能死去，作为殖民地平民而死，作为奴隶而亡。绞刑架上的死亡，恐怕难以抹去可耻，天命难违，听其自然。假如归于天堂极乐，我的国家将从我的卑微生命消逝中有所受益，牺牲者已做好准备随时祭祀自己宝贵生命，不妨让我坦然面对那一时刻的降临。然而，如果我能幸存于世，那么，让我拥抱一个国家，或者至少是一个国家的希望，甚至一个自由的国度。

        7．无论我们命运如何，我敢担保，请放心，这份独立宣言将会生效，或许为此耗费巨大，或许会有众多流血牺牲；但它一定会生效，并势必极大地弥补以下两点：透过眼前的血腥晦暗，我看见未来光明，如同天堂的明媚阳光；今天将留存于史，光荣不朽的一天。一旦我们走进坟墓，子孙后代将以此荣耀，他们将以感恩心情、节日欢腾、以篝火与斑斓灯饰庆贺这一伟大神圣时刻的到来。每逢周年纪念日，孩子们将泪如雨下；他们并非为专制或奴隶制伤悲，并非为极端痛苦或窘迫贫穷哭泣，而是难以抑制的狂喜，难以言谢的感恩，还有难以表述的满腔畅快淋漓。

        8．先生们，在上帝面前，我相信这一时刻即将到来。我的判断为权衡时事提供依据，与此同时，我也全身心为此奋斗，包括我的所有财富，我的所有存在，我生活中的所有希冀，我已做好准备为此赌注；一旦开始，万劫不归，或者说，生存抑或死亡？苟存抑或毁灭？皆为系此一念。我将为《独立宣言》存活于世，它构成我生命的感喟悲伤，面对上帝祝福，它亦将成为我死亡的唏嘘，现在独立，意味独立永远。





        LESSON 65





THE RISING


        呐喊震天

        Thomas Buchanan Read (b. 1822, d. 1872) was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania. In 1839 he entered a sculptor’s studio in Cincinnati, where he gained reputation as a portrait painter. He afterwards went to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and, in 1850, to Italy. He divided his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome, in the latter years of his life. Some or his poems are marked by vigor and strength, while others are distinguished by smoothness and delicacy. The following selection is abridged from “The Wagoner of the Alleghanies.”





        1. Out of the North the wild news came,

        Far flashing on its wings of flame,

        Swift as the boreal[13] light which flies

        At midnight through the startled skies.





        2. And there was tumult in the air,

        The fife’s shrill note, the drum’s loud beat,

        And through the wide land everywhere

        The answering tread of hurrying feet,

        While the first oath of Freedom’s gun

        Came on the blast from Lexington.

        And Concord, roused, no longer tame,

        Forgot her old baptismal name,

        Made bare her patriot arm of power,

        And swelled the discord of the hour.

        3. The yeoman[14] and the yeoman’s son,

        With knitted brows and sturdy dint[15],

        Renewed the polish of each gun,

        Recoiled the lock, reset the flint;

        And oft the maid and matron there,

        While kneeling in the firelight glare,

        Long poured, with half-suspended breath,

        The lead into the molds of death.





              4. The hands by Heaven made silken soft

        To soothe the brow of love or pain,

        Alas! are dulled and soiled too oft

        By some unhallowed earthly stain;

        But under the celestial bound

        No nobler picture can be found

        Than woman, brave in word and deed,

        Thus serving in her nation’s need:

        Her love is with her country now,

        Her hand is on its aching brow.

        5. Within its shade of elm and oak

        The church of Berkley Manor[16] stood:

        There Sunday found the rural folk,

        And some esteemed of gentle[17] blood,

        In vain their feet with loitering tread

        Passed ’mid the graves where rank is naught:

        All could not read the lesson taught

        In that republic of the dead.





        6. The pastor rose: the prayer was strong;

        The psalm was warrior David’s song;

        The text, a few short words of might,—

        “The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!”





        7. He spoke of wrongs too long endured,

        Of sacred rights to be secured;

        Then from his patriot tongue of flame

        The startling words for Freedom came.

        The stirring sentences he spake

        Compelled the heart to glow or quake,

        And, rising on his theme’s[18] broad wing,

        And grasping in his nervous hand

        The imaginary battle brand,

        In face of death he dared to fling

        Defiance to a tyrant king.





        8. Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed

        In eloquence of attitude,

        Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;

        Then swept his kindling glance of fire

        From startled pew to breathless choir;

        When suddenly his mantle wide

        His hands impatient flung aside,



              And, lo! he met their wondering eyes

        Complete in all a warrior’s guise[19].





        9.A moment there was awful pause,—

        When Berkley cried, “Cease, traitor! cease!

        God’s temple is the house of peace!”

        The other shouted, “Nay, not so,

        When God is with our righteous cause:

        His holiest places then are ours,

        His temples are our forts and towers

        That frown upon the tyrant foe:

        In this the dawn of Freedom’s day

        There is a time to fight and pray!”





        10. And now before the open door—

        The warrior priest had ordered so—

        The enlisting trumpet’s sudden soar[20]

        Rang through the chapel, o’er and o’er,

        Its long reverberating blow,

        So loud and clear, it seemed the ear

        Of dusty death must wake and hear.

        And there the startling drum and fife

        Fired the living with fiercer life;

        While overhead with wild increase,

        Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,

        The great bell swung as ne’er before:

        It seemed as it would never cease;

        And every word its ardor flung

        From off its jubilant iron tongue

        Was, “WAR! WAR! WAR!”





        11. “Who dares”—this was the patriot’s cry,

         As striding from the desk he came—

         “Come out with me, in Freedom’s name,

         For her to live, for her to die?”

         A hundred hands flung up reply,

         A hundred voices answered “I!”

        1．疯狂消息自北方传来，

        遥远天际见火光翻飞，

        迅捷犹如扑面的灯火，

        掠过惊悚的星空夜半。





        2．风中席卷起狂热骚动，

        笛声乍裂，鼓号雷鸣，

        消息传遍每一处角落，

        人影绰绰中步履凌乱，

        自由枪声第一声誓言，

        在列克星敦康科德上空乍响，

        唤醒不再驯服的奴隶，

        忘却曾经洗礼的教名，

        危机中果敢拿起武器，

        彰显爱国者反抗勇气。





        3．自由民及其子孙后代，

        眉头舒展而肩臂有力，

        将每一杆枪擦得铮亮，

        扳动枪栓再放好燧石，

        各户妇孺老人默默地，

        跪立火堆沉重地注视。

        长久赋税的艰难呼吸，

        将躯体浇铸死亡模具。





        4．耶和华柔软无形双手，

        抚慰痛苦纠结的众生，

        肮脏自私的世俗恶念，

        使人呆滞亦玷污心灵。



              然苍穹在上规则有序，

        无人能超过圣母光辉，

        坚毅勇敢且言行如一，

        甘心为臣民鞠躬尽瘁，

        她的爱眷念广袤土地，

        她的手抚摸疼痛眉宇。





        5．榆树橡树浓密荫凉下，

        伯克莱庄园教堂肃穆，

        周末欢快的乡村舞曲，

        达贵名媛们打发虚空，

        杯筹交错中骄奢纵欲。

        坟墓中等级化为乌有，

        生而平等法则无法授予，

        写在共和国血泊土地。





        6．牧师站起祷告声粗犷，

        赞美诗讴歌勇士大卫。

        简短诗文却铿锵有力，

        万民之神耶和华授权正义！





        7．谈起难以忍受多年苦楚，

        牧师主张神圣权利获取，

        从他的炽烈爱国语言里，

        自由女神飘曳迷人美丽。

        振奋人心话语燃烧心底，

        心在震颤不再蒙受冤屈。

        自由独立成为嘹亮号角，

        呼唤起义牧师扬起双臂，

        无所畏惧战争即将到来，

        面对死亡应该勇敢奋起，

        朝着暴戾君主拿起武器。





        8．他激情演讲，体态多变，

        他口若悬河，滔滔不绝，

        他愤怒而起，形象高大，

        他目光如炬，震惊全场。

        唱诗班吟唱，实难喘息。

        他突然抖开，宽大斗篷，

        他双手挥舞，激情难抑，

        看！台下目光，纷纷啧奇，

        他早已全身，战士装备。





        9．恰好那时光，空气瞬间已凝固，

        伯克莱高叫，“住口！你这个叛徒！

        上帝的殿堂，和平安宁之地！”

        另一声音叫喊，“不！绝非如此，

        耶和华将会，与公正站在一起，

        上帝的住所，乃人间美梦天堂，

        神圣的琼楼，为人间权利堡垒，

        它不会同意，被暴君抢夺盘踞。

        难忘时刻中，反抗和祷告同在。

        黎明星光里，自由与正义降临。”





        10．祷告结束后，会场的大门打开，

        那军队祭司，开始向民众游说，

        高声喇叭里，招募征兵的火爆，

        经久不停地，在会场上空起荡，

        激昂的话语，乍响在民众心头，

        震撼并催醒，尘封濒死的耳朵，

        万民之惊悚，鼓乐齐鸣的浪潮，

        激励着生者，投入残酷的战争，

        看头顶上空，烈火在蔓延燃烧，

        全然不再是，古老平和的钟响，



              风声中炸开，声音已走调变样，

        听起来好像，狂飙绝不会停息，

        每一声钟声，发泄着激情热烈，

        铁质的音质，不再有满心喜悦，

        异口同声呼喊，“开战！开战！开战！”





        11．“谁敢参军？” 那爱国者高叫，

        他离开桌子，大踏步来到面前，

        “以自由名义，请与我奔向前线，

        为祖国生存，或者看着她灭亡？”

        森林般大手，刹那间挥舞天空，

        雷鸣海啸，吼声震天“我去！”“我去！”





        LESSON 66





CONTROL[21] YOUR TEMPER


        请君制怒

        John Todd, D.D. (b. 1800, d. 1873), was born in Rutland, Vt. In 1842 he was settled as a pastor of a Congregational Church, in Pittsfield, Mass, In 1834, he published “Lectures to Children”; in 1835, “The Student’s Manual,” a valuable and popular work, which has been translated into several European languages; in 1836, “The Sabbath-School Teacher”; and in 1841, “The Lost Sister of Wyoming.” He was one of the founders of the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary.





        1. No one has a temper naturally so good, that it does not need attention and cultivation[22], and no one has a temper so bad, but that, by proper culture, it may become pleasant. One of the best disciplined[23] tempers ever seen, was that of a gentleman who was naturally quick, irritable, rash, and violent; but, by having the care of the sick, and especially of deranged people, he so completely mastered himself that he was never known to be thrown off his guard.

        2. The difference in the happiness which is received or bestowed by the man who governs his temper, and that by the man who does not, is immense. There is no misery so constant, so distressing, and so intolerable[24] to others, as that of having a disposition which is your master, and which is continually fretting itself. There are corners enough, at every turn in life, against which we may run, and at which we may break out in impatience, if we choose.

        3. Look at Roger Sherman, who rose from a humble occupation to a seat in the first Congress of the United States, and whose judgment was received with great deference by[25] that body of distinguished men. He made himself master of his temper, and cultivated it as a great business in life. There are one or two instances which show this part of his character in a light that is beautiful.

        4. One day, after having received his highest honors, he was sitting and reading in his parlor. A roguish student, in a room close by, held a looking-glass in such a position as to pour the reflected rays of the sun directly in Mr. Sherman’s face. He moved his chair, and the thing was repeated. A third time the chair was moved, but the looking-glass still reflected the sun in his eyes. He laid aside his book, went to the window, and many witnesses of the impudence expected to hear the ungentlemanly student severely reprimanded[26]. He raised the window gently, and then—shut the window blind!

        5. I can not forbear adducing another instance of the power he had acquired over himself. He was naturally possessed of strong passions; but over these he at length obtained an extraordinary control. He became habitually calm, sedate, and self-possessed. Mr. Sherman was one of those men who are not ashamed to maintain the forms of religion in their families. One morning he called them all together, as usual, to lead them in prayer to God; the “old family Bible” was brought out, and laid on the table.





              6. Mr. Sherman took his seat, and placed beside him one of his children, a child of his old age; the rest of the family were seated around the room; several of these were now grown up. Besides these, some of the tutors of the college were boarders in the family, and were present at the time alluded to. His aged and superannuated[27] mother occupied a corner of the room, opposite the place where the distinguished judge sat.

        7. At length, he opened the Bible, and began to read. The child who was seated beside him made some little disturbance, upon which Mr. Sherman paused and told it to be still. Again he proceeded; but again he paused to reprimand the little offender, whose playful disposition would scarcely permit it to be still. And this time he gently tapped its ear. The blow, if blow it might be called, caught the attention of his aged mother, who now, with some effort, rose from the seat, and tottered across the room. At length she reached the chair of Mr. Sherman, and, in a moment, most unexpectedly to him, she gave him a blow on the ear with all the force she could summon. “There,” said she, “you strike your child, and I will strike mine.”

        8. For a moment, the blood was seen mounting to the face of Mr. Sherman; but it was only for a moment, when all was calm and mild as usual. He paused; he raised his spectacles; he cast his eye upon his mother; again it fell upon the book from which he had been reading. Not a word escaped him; but again he calmly pursued the service, and soon after sought in prayer an ability to set an example before his household which would be worthy of their imitation. Such a victory was worth more than the proudest one ever achieved[28] on the field of battle.

        1．没有人天生就有好脾气，好脾气无需关注与培养；没有人天生就有坏脾气，但合适的教育环境下，坏脾气可以变好。有这样一个事例，与最为训练有素的好脾气有关。一位先生生来性情急躁易怒、轻率暴虐，但是通过照看病人，特别那些患有精神病症的患者，他最终能够控制自身情绪，因此别人对他坦诚而无需设防，至于他的坏脾气，甚至不为人知。



              2．接受幸福抑或馈赠幸福的人，究竟能否掌控还是无法掌控自己的脾气，由此构成不同幸福感的巨大差异。人，不会永远面对不幸，不会总是悲观沮丧，或始终无法容忍别人，因此，拥有好性情乃做人之道，甚至不时为如何拥有好性情而忧心忡忡。我们很可能在生活转折中陷入诸多逆境，一旦受阻，倘若可以选择，我们或许急于逃避，或许失去耐心急于摆脱。

        3．以罗杰 · 谢尔曼为例来说，他从底层社会做起，直到在美国第一届国会拥有席位，他的大法官地位备受国会精英名流的仰慕推崇。谢尔曼先生对自己性情掌控从容，并在生活中作为至关重要的素养精心培育，以下一两个事例即可展示他光彩照人的性格魅力。

        4．有一天，当荣获最高荣誉后，他坐在客厅读书。他住处附近有一位恶作剧的淘气学生，他手拿一块镜片晃动，将光线径直反射在谢尔曼先生的脸上，他只是挪动一下自己椅子，不过还是未能逃过刺眼的光线。如此再三，光线仍然追逐他的脸。最后，他索性丢下书本，走到窗前，周围目睹此事的学生原以为他会严厉斥责那位粗鲁冒失的学生，他不过轻轻地放下窗帘，然后一声不吭地将窗户遮严！



        5．这里，不得不再提一例，看看谢尔曼先生如何控制自己的性情。他天生激情四射，凡事却冷静稳重，自我克制，最终达到心性调节的完美境界。就维系家庭的宗教形式来说，谢尔曼先生从不耻于主持。一天早晨，他像往常一样召集家人，带着他们向上帝祷告；他取出《圣经》，然后放置桌上。

        6．谢尔曼先生坐下，将他晚年所生的最小孩子放在身边座位上。全家人围圈坐好，其中有些孩子已经成人，也有孩子在学院做教师同时寄宿家中，大家都在约定时间到场。谢尔曼先生耄耋之年的母亲依偎角落，坐在这位声名显赫的法官对面。



        7．待大家安顿坐好，他打开《圣经》开始朗读。坐在他身边的孩子闹出些许响动，谢尔曼先生停下来，告诉孩子保持安静，然后继续诵读经文。那孩子仍然坐立不安，父亲只得再度停下，责备这位不懂事的小家伙，但生性爱动的孩子很难保持安静。做父亲的他，只是轻轻地拍打一下孩子的耳朵，如果不妨称为“拍打”的话。法官的老母亲看到这些，她费力地从座位上站起，蹒跚地走到桌子对面，来到谢尔曼先生身边，站立片刻；他万万没有想到的是，母亲用尽全身力气，狠狠地给了他一记响亮的耳光。“既然，”她说，“你可以打你的孩子，我也可以打我的孩子。”

        8．片刻工夫，血从谢尔曼先生脸上渗出，他只是略作停息，再度戴好眼镜，看了看母亲，然后拿起书从先前暂停地方，一字不漏地开始重新朗读。全家人很快恢复了往常的宁静平和，谢尔曼先生再度冷静地完成了职责，在祷告中寻求一种为家庭竖立榜样的能力，一种值得孩子们模仿的能力。的确，就战场上自豪胜利者而言，这种内在美德实在超过军人的威武尊严。





        LESSON 67





WILLIAM TELL


        威廉·泰尔

        James Sheridan Knowles (b. 1784, d. 1862), a dramatist and actor, was born in Cork, Ireland. In 1792 his father removed to London with his family. At the age of fourteen, Sheridan wrote an opera called “The Chevalier de Grillon.” In 1798 he removed to Dublin, and soon after began his career as an actor and author. In 1835 he visited America. In 1839 an annual pension of ￡200 was granted him by the British government. Several years before his death he left the stage and became a Baptist minister. The best known of his plays are “Caius Gracchus,” “Virginius,” “Leo, the Gypsy,” “The Hunchback,” and “William Tell,” from the last of which the following two lessons are abridged.





        SCENE 1. —A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Gesler, Officers, and Sarnem, with Tell in chains and guarded.





        Sar. Down, slave! Behold the governor.

         Down! down! and beg for mercy.

        Ges. (Seated.) Does he hear?

        Sar. He does, but braves thy power.

        Officer. Why don’t you smite him for that look?

        Ges. Can I believe

         My eyes? He smiles! Nay, grasps

         His chains as he would make a weapon of them

         To lay the smiter dead. (To Tell.)

         Why speakest thou not?

        Tell. For wonder.

        Ges. Wonder?

        Tell. Yes, that thou shouldst seem a man.

        Ges. What should I seem?

        Tell. A monster.

        Ges. Ha! Beware! Think on thy chains.

        Tell. Though they were doubled, and did weigh me down

         Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up

         Erect, with nothing but the honest pride

         Of telling thee, usurper, to thy teeth,

         Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains?

         How came they on me?

        Ges. Darest thou question me?

        Tell. Darest thou not answer?

        Ges. Do I hear?



              Tell. Thou dost.

        Ges. Beware my vengeance!

        Tell. Can it more than kill?

        Ges. Enough; it can do that.

        Tell. No; not enough:

         It can not take away the grace of life;

         Its comeliness[29] of look that virtue gives;

         Its port[30] erect with consciousness of truth;

         Its rich attire[31] of honorable deeds;

         Its fair report that’s rife on good men’s tongues;

         It can not lay its hands on these, no more

         Than it can pluck the brightness from the sun,

         Or with polluted finger tarnish[32] it.

        Ges. But it can make thee writhe.

        Tell. It may.

        Ges. And groan.

        Tell. It may; and I may cry

         Go on, though it should make me groan again.

        Ges. Whence comest thou?

        Tell. From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn

         What news from thence?

        Ges. Canst tell me any?

        Tell. Ay: they watch no more the avalanche[33].

        Ges. Why so?

        Tell. Because they look for thee. The hurricane

         Comes unawares upon them; from its bed

         The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track.

        Ges. What do they then?

        Tell. Thank heaven it is not thou!

         Thou hast perverted nature in them.

         There’s not a blessing heaven vouchsafes[34] them, but

         The thought of thee—doth wither to a curse.

        Ges. That’s right! I’d have them like their hills,

         That never smile, though wanton[35] summer tempt

         Them e’er so much.

        Tell. But they do sometimes smile.

        Ges. Ay! when is that?

        Tell. When they do talk of vengeance.

        Ges. Vengeance? Dare they talk of that?

        Tell. Ay, and expect it too.

        Ges. From whence?



              Tell. From heaven!

        Ges. From heaven?

        Tell. And their true hands

         Are lifted up to it on every hill

         For justice on thee.

        Ges. Where’s thy abode?

        Tell. I told thee, on the mountains.

        Ges. Art married?

        Tell. Yes.

        Ges. And hast a family?

        Tell. A son.

        Ges. A son? Sarnem!

        Sar. My lord, the boy—(Gesler signs to Sarnem to keep silence, and,



         whispering, sends him off.)

        Tell. The boy? What boy?

         Is ’t mine? and have they netted[36] my young fledgeling[37]?

         Now heaven support me, if they have! He’ll own me,

         And share his father’s ruin! But a look

         Would put him on his guard—yet how to give it!

         Now heart, thy nerve; forget thou ’rt flesh, be rock.

         They come, they come!

         That step—that step—that little step, so light

         Upon the ground, how heavy does it fall

         Upon my heart! I feel my child! (Enter Sarnem with Albert, whose eyes

         are riveted on Tell’s bow,which Sarnem carries.)

         ’T is he! We can but perish.

        Alb. (Aside.) Yes; I was right. It is my father’s bow!

         For there’s my father! I’ll not own him though!

        Sar. See!

        Alb. What?

        Sar. Look there!

        Alb. I do, what would you have me see?

        Sar. Thy father.

        Alb. Who? That—that my father?

        Tell. My boy! my boy! my own brave boy!

         He’s safe! (Aside.)

        Sar. (Aside to Gesler.) They’re like each other.

        Ges. Yet I see no sign

         Of recognition[38] to betray the link

         Unites a father and his child.

        Sar. My lord, I am sure it is his father. Look at them.

         That boy did spring from him; or never cast

         Came from the mold it fitted! It may be



               A preconcerted[39] thing ’gainst such a chance.

         That they survey each other coldly thus.

        Ges. We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff[40].

        Sar. To a dungeon?

        Ges. No; into the court.

        Sar. The court, my lord?

        Ges. And send

         To tell the headsman to make ready. Quick!

         The slave shall die! You marked the boy?

        Sar. I did. He started; 't is his father.

        Ges. We shall see. Away with him!

        Tell. Stop! Stop!

        Ges. What would you?

        Tell. Time,—A little time to call my thoughts together!

        Ges. Thou shalt not have a minute.

        Tell. Some one, then, to speak with.

        Ges. Hence with him!

        Tell. A moment! Stop! Let me speak to the boy.

        Ges. Is he thy son?

        Tell. And if He were, art thou so lost to nature, as

         To send me forth to die before his face?

        Ges. Well! speak with him. Now, Sarnem, mark them well.

        Tell. Thou dost not know me, boy; and well for thee

         Thou dost not. I’m the father of a son

         About thy age. Thou, I see, wast horn, like him, upon the hills:

         If thou shouldst ’scape thy present thraldom[41], he

         May chance to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee

         Relate to him what has been passing here,

         And say I laid my hand upon thy head,

         And said to thee, if he were here, as thou art,

         Thus would I bless him. Mayst thou live, my boy,

         To see thy country free, or die for her,

         As I do! (Albert weeps.)

        Sar. Mark! he weeps.

        Tell. Were he my son,

         He would not shed a tear! He would remember

         The cliff where he was bred, and learned to scan[42]

         A thousand fathoms’ depth of nether[43] air;

         Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,

         And meet the lightning, eye to eye; where last

         We spoke together, when I told him death

         Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,



               Embraced for virtue’s sake. He shed a tear!

         Now were he by, I’d talk to him, and his cheek

         Should never blanch[44], nor moisture dim his eye—

         I’d talk to him—

        Sar. He falters!

        Tell. ’T is too much!

         And yet it must be done! I’d talk to him—

        Ges. Of what?

        Tell. The mother, tyrant, thou dost make

         A widow of! I’d talk to him of her.

         I’d bid him tell her, next to liberty,

         Her name was the last word my lips pronounced.

         And I would charge him never to forget

         To love and cherish her, as he would have

         His father’s dying blessing rest upon him!

        Sar. You see, as he doth prompt, the other acts.

        Tell. So well he bears it, he doth vanquish me.

         My boy! my boy! Oh, for the hills, the hills,

         To see him bound along their tops again, With liberty.

        Sar. Was there not an the father in that look?

        Ges. Yet ’t is ’gainst nature.

        Sar. Not if he believes

         To own the son would be to make him share

         The father’s death.

        Ges. I did not think of that! ’T is well

         The boy is not thy son. I’ve destined him

         To die along with thee.

        Tell. To die? For what?

        Ges. For having braved my power, as thou hast. Lead them forth.

        Tell. He’s but a child.

        Ges. Away with them!

        Tell. Perhaps an only child.

        Ges. No matter.

        Tell. He may have a mother.

        Ges. So the viper hath;

         And yet, who spares it for the mother’s sake?

        Tell. I talk to stone! I talk to it as though

         ’T were flesh; and know ’t is none. I’ll talk to it

         No more. Come, my boy;

         I taught thee how to live, I’ll show thee how to die.

        Ges. He is thy child?

        Tell. He is my child. (Weeps.)

        Ges. I’ve wrung a tear from him! Thy name?

        Tell. My name?

         It matters not to keep it from thee now;

         My name is Tell.



              Ges. Tell? William Tell?

        Tell. The same.

        Ges. What! he, so famed ’bove all his countrymen,

         For guiding o’er the stormy lake the boat?

         And such a master of his bow, ’t is said

         His arrows never miss! Indeed! I’ll take

         Exquisite vengeance! Mark! I’ll spare thy life;

         Thy boy’s too; both of you are free; on one

         Condition.

        Tell. Name it.

        Ges. I would see you make

         A trial of your skill with that same bow

         You shoot so well with.

        Tell. Name the trial you

         Would have me make.

        Ges. You look upon your boy

         As though instinctively you guessed it.

        Tell. Look upon my boy? What mean you? Look upon

         My boy as though I guessed it? Guessed the trial

         You’d have me make? Guessed it

         Instinctively? You do not mean—no—no,

         You would not have me make a trial of

         My skill upon my child! Impossible!

         I do not guess your meaning.

        Ges. I would see

         Thee hit an apple at the distance of

         A hundred paces.

        Tell. Is my boy to hold it?

        Ges. No.

        Tell. No? I’ll send the arrow through the core!

        Ges. It is to rest upon his head.

        Tell. Great heaven, you hear him!

        Ges. Thou dost hear the choice I give:

         Such trial of the skill thou art master of,

         Or death to both of you, not otherwise

         To be escaped.

        Tell. O, monster!

        Ges. Wilt thou do it?

        Alb. He will! he will!

        Tell. Ferocious monster! Make

         A father murder his own child!

        Ges. Take off his chains if he consent.

        Tell. With his own hand!

        Ges. Does he consent?

        Alb. He does. (Gesler signs to his officers, who proceed to take off Tell’s



         chains; Tell unconscious what they do.)

        Tell. With his own hand!



               Murder his child with his own hand? This hand?

         The hand I’ve led him, when an infant, by?

         ’T is beyond horror! ’T is most horrible!

         Amazement! (His chains fall off.) What’s that you’ve done to me?

         Villains! put on my chains again. My hands

         Are free from blood, and have no gust[45] for it,

         That they should drink my child’s! Here! here! I’ll

         Not murder my boy for Gesler.

        Alb. Father! Father!

         You will not hit me, father!

        Tell. Hit thee? Send

         The arrow through thy brain? Or, missing that,

         Shoot out an eye? Or, if thine eye escape,

         Mangle the cheek I’ve seen thy mother’s lips

         Cover with kisses? Hit thee? Hit a hair

         Of thee, and cleave thy mother’s heart?

        Ges. Dost thou consent?

        Tell. Give me my bow and quiver.

        Ges. For what?

        Tell. To shoot my boy!

        Alb. No, father, no!

         To save me! You’ll be sure to hit the apple.

         Will you not save me, father?

        Tell. Lead me forth;

         I’ll make the trial!

        Alb. Thank you!

        Tell. Thank me? Do

         You know for what? I will not make the trial.

         To take him to his mother in my arms!

         And lay him down a corse before her!

        Ges. Then he dies this moment, and you certainly

         Do murder him whose life you have a chance

         To save, and will not use it.

        Tell. Well, I’ll do it; I’ll make the trial.

        Alb. Father!

        Tell. Speak not to me:

         Let me not hear thy voice: thou must be dumb,

         And so should all things be. Earth should be dumb;

         And heaven—unless its thunders muttered at

         The deed, and sent a bolt to stop! Give me

         My bow and quiver!

        Ges. When all’s ready.

        Tell. Ready!—

         I must be calm with such a mark to hit!

         Don’t touch me, child!—Don’t speak to me!—Lead on!

        詹姆斯 · 谢里登 · 诺尔斯(1784～1862)，一位出生于爱尔兰科克的戏剧家兼演员。1792年，他的父亲携家重新搬回伦敦。14岁时，谢里登写了一部名为《蟋蟀骑士》的歌剧。1798年，他又再度迁居都柏林，并很快开始从事演员兼剧作者的职业生涯。1835年，他访问美国。1839年，英国政府授予他每年200英镑的年金。在他去世的前几年，谢里登离开舞台，成为浸礼会牧师。他最负盛名的戏剧为《凯厄斯 · 格拉古》、《弗吉尼厄斯》、《吉普赛人利奥》、《驼子》以及《威廉·泰尔》，以下两课节选最后一篇。





        第一幕：城堡内一处房间。盖斯勒、众官吏、萨勒姆，以及带着镣铐、并由卫兵押解的泰尔走了进来。





        萨勒姆：跪下，你这奴隶！看着长官。跪下！跪下！快请求饶恕。

        盖斯勒：（坐好）他听见了吗？

        萨勒姆：他听见了，但他无视你的威严。

        某官吏：为什么不为他态度倨傲严加惩罚？

        盖斯勒：我不敢相信，他居然在笑！天呀， 他握着铁链想还击，好像准备置人死地。（对泰尔）为什么不说话？

        泰尔：真是想不到。

        盖斯勒：想不到什么？

        泰尔：想不到，看起来你不像人。

        盖斯勒：像什么？

        泰尔：一个残忍的怪物。

        盖斯勒：哈哈！当心！ 仔细看你身上的铁镣。

        泰尔：看，这么多铁链，拖拽我快要趴在地上，我觉得，我还是能笔直站起来，不凭别的，就是坦诚地告诉你，你这个地道的篡位者，十足的怪兽！仔细看我的铁链？这铁链怎么套到我的身上？

        盖斯勒：你竟敢质问我？

        泰尔：你为什么不敢回答？

        盖斯勒：我要听你的？

        泰尔：是的。

        盖斯勒：小心我报复！

        泰尔：大不了一个死。



              盖斯勒：那就足够了，很容易。

        泰尔：不，远远不能，死亡不能翦灭生命的高贵；不能消除美德给予的俊朗，死亡不能摧毁睿智者的灵魂高蹈，不能褪去高尚情操者的华美衣裳， 死亡不能剥夺正义者不乏优雅的谈吐；死亡无法触及这些崇高，就像你们这些手上肮脏的家伙，无法从太阳那里攫取一丝阳光。

        盖斯勒：但是，我会让你吃苦头的。

        泰尔：当然。

        盖斯勒：我会让你痛苦不堪。

        泰尔：没错。

        盖斯勒：你可能还会痛苦呻吟。

        泰尔：是的，很可能不停叫唤。

        盖斯勒：你从哪里来？

        泰尔：我从山里来。你听到那里传来的消息吗？

        盖斯勒：你可以告诉我吗？

        泰尔：天呀，我们的人再也看不到雪崩了。

        盖斯勒：什么意思？

        泰尔：他们在抓你，没想到暴风雪来了，山脚发生雪崩，他们陷进去了。

        盖斯勒：然后呢？

        泰尔：老天有眼无珠，难道不是你的缘故？你使老天加害于他们身上，不是赐予他们的祝福天堂，而恰恰是你内心想要的毒咒。

        盖斯勒：不错，我就是想让他们像大山那样，再也不会开口说话，尽管夏天万物繁茂，对他们来说诱惑实在太多。

        泰尔：可他们经常还会说笑。

        盖斯勒：哦，什么时候？

        泰尔：每次谈起复仇的时候。

        盖斯勒：什么？他们敢说复仇？

        泰尔：哈，不仅谈论，还在指望。

        盖斯勒：他们在哪里？

        泰尔：他们在天上！

        盖斯勒：在天上？

        泰尔：每一座山伸向真实的复仇双手，正义要求你血债血偿。

        盖斯勒：你住在哪里？



              泰尔：我告诉过你，在山上。

        盖斯勒：你结婚了吗？

        泰尔：是的。

        盖斯勒：家里还有别的人吗？

        泰尔：一个儿子。

        盖斯勒：儿子？萨勒姆！

        萨勒姆：老爷，那孩子——（盖斯勒示意萨勒姆示意别声张，对他耳语几句，将他打发出去）



        泰尔：孩子？谁的孩子？我的儿子？他们设计陷害我那不懂事的孩子？他们这样做，老天会开眼的！儿子会认同我，和他父亲一起面对灾难！可无论谁看他一眼，他也会立刻惊觉，怎么告诉他呢？我的宝贝！小心点，别害怕，坚强些。他们来了，他们来抓你了！那脚步声，轻轻地一点点走近了，却是重重地踩在我的心上。孩子呀，我能感觉你过来了。

        （萨勒姆带着阿尔伯特走了进来，阿尔伯特眼睛紧紧盯着萨勒姆手上拿着的弓弩。）就是他！大家都愣住了。

        阿尔伯特：（闪到一边）是的，我没看错，就是我爸爸的弓箭！虽然我还没看见我爸爸，他一定在这里！

        萨勒姆：看那边！

        阿尔伯特：哪儿？

        萨勒姆：那边！

        阿尔伯特：我看了，你让我看谁呀？

        萨勒姆：你爸爸呀！

        阿尔伯特：谁？那——那是我爸爸？

        泰尔：孩子，我的孩子，勇敢的好孩子！他很好。（闪到一边）



        萨勒姆：（闪在一边对盖斯勒说）他们俩长得很像。

        盖斯勒：我可看不出丝毫破绽，这父亲和孩子长得一点也不像。

        萨勒姆：老爷，我相信那家伙就是那孩子父亲，你看他俩，那男孩确实与泰尔很像，否则怎会有同样的模子刻出来？虽然他们不过彼此冷淡地打量一下，或许，那是他们事先想好的对策来应付这样场合。

        盖斯勒：我们来查个究竟，带上那个混蛋。

        萨勒姆：去地牢？

        盖斯勒：不，去法庭。



              萨勒姆：法庭吗，老爷?

        盖斯勒：派人通知法官做好准备，快去！那奴隶很快将被处死，你注意到那孩子表情吗？

        萨勒姆：我确实看到，他感到吃惊；那家伙就是他父亲。

        盖斯勒：我们来看看，把孩子给我带走！

        泰尔：慢着！慢着！

        盖斯勒：你要做什么？

        泰尔：给我点时间，让我想一下！

        盖斯勒：你没有时间了。

        泰尔：我有话要说，

        盖斯勒：把他带走！

        泰尔：等会，停一下！我想和那孩子说句话。

        盖斯勒：他是你儿子？

        泰尔：如果他是我儿子，你们难道这么丧尽天良，让我在他的面前被处死？

        盖斯勒：好！和那孩子说吧。萨勒姆，你可要把他们看好咯！

        泰尔：孩子，你不认识我，即使这样，没关系。我的儿子和你差不多大，我看着你，就像看他一样，你们都是大山的孩子。如果万一你能逃出这里，他或许能遇见你；如果你们能见面，我请求你告诉他这里发生的事情，告诉他，我把手就是这样放到你的头顶，对你这样说话，如果他在这里，也会和你现在一样，因此，我真心地祝福你。你必须活下去，我的孩子，看到你的国家获得自由的那一天，或者像我这样，为国家而死。（阿尔伯特哭泣）



        萨勒姆：看！那孩子在哭。

        泰尔：如果他是我的儿子，他不会流一滴眼泪，他会记住在山里的悬崖峭壁上，他曾经接受严格训练，学会辨别来自很远的风中声音，学会倾听雷鸣，学会与闪电面对面对话。当我最后一次与他交谈时，我对他说，死亡将珍贵的宝石馈赠有尊严的生命；由于人的高尚美德，死亡将拥抱有尊严的个体，他听后流下了眼泪。如果他现在在这里，我也会对他说，你的脸颊不会苍白，眼泪不会让眼睛黯淡，我想要对他说——

        萨勒姆：那孩子在发抖。

        泰尔：我说得太多了。不过，这些都是必须要说的，我还想和他谈谈——

        盖斯勒：还谈什么？

        泰尔：谈谈他的妈妈。暴君，你确实让一个女人成为寡妇。我想和他谈谈那女人。我让他保证转告那位母亲，在自由快要来到时，我最后说出的是她的名字。我要让他发誓别忘记他妈妈，更要疼爱她，珍惜她，这些都是他的儿子获得父亲的临终祝福！



              萨勒姆：你看，他快快地说，让孩子快快地记。

        泰尔：孩子，你都记下来了，太棒了，太让我感动了，孩子！我的孩子！哦，希望能再看到你自由自在地在山间奔跑玩耍。

        萨勒姆：他难道一点不认父亲？

        盖斯勒：不错，那有违天性。

        萨勒姆：他不会认他的儿子，他才不会让孩子和自己一起去送死。

        盖斯勒：我根本不这么想！好哇，哪怕这孩子不是你儿子，可我让他和你一起去死。

        泰尔：和我一起死，为什么？

        盖斯勒：因为你所作所为冒犯了我的威严，把他们带走！

        泰尔：他不过是个孩子。

        盖斯勒：把他们带走！

        泰尔：这么小的孩子。

        盖斯勒：不要再说了。

        泰尔：他或许还有母亲。

        盖斯勒：你心这么狠，还有谁为那母亲饶恕这孩子？

        泰尔：你们真是铁石心肠！丧尽天良！没有用，什么也别再说了。过来，我的孩子！我教你怎样活着，也让你知道怎样去死。

        盖斯勒：他真是你的孩子？

        泰尔：他是我的儿子。（哭泣）



        盖斯勒：我用尽手段，他才流下一滴眼泪。你的名字？

        泰尔：我的名字？现在问这些有用吗？我叫泰尔。

        盖斯勒：泰尔？威廉 · 泰尔？

        泰尔：没错。

        盖斯勒：什么！你……你真是那个大名鼎鼎、身经百战的威廉 · 泰尔？你那些同胞的头领？照这么说，你居然就是这把弩弓主人，从来都是箭无虚发！天呀！



        我会来次完美的复仇！听好！我将赦免你，还有你的孩子。从现在开始，你们自由了，只是你要答应我的唯一条件。



              泰尔：说吧。

        盖斯勒：我要看看，让你用那把弓弩露一手，听说你射技相当不错。

        泰尔：说吧，你到底要我做什么。

        盖斯勒：你看了一眼你的孩子，你的本能反应似乎不错。

        泰尔：看我的孩子？什么意思？难道看看孩子，就能猜对？猜测一下你究竟要我做什么？本能反应？你不是指的是——，不，不，你不能让我用自己孩子来证明我的射技！绝不可能！我没有猜到你的意思。

        盖斯勒：我想看看你是否能在一百码开外射中一个苹果。

        泰尔：我的儿子手拿苹果？

        盖斯勒：不！

        泰尔：如果他不拿，我会射穿苹果的果核。

        盖斯勒：苹果必须放到你儿子的头顶。

        泰尔：万能的主！听听他究竟说了什么！

        盖斯勒：听好，这是我给你的选择：看看你射技究竟如何，否则你俩都得死，没人能活下来。

        泰尔：天呀，你这个畜生！

        盖斯勒：你不愿试一下？

        阿尔伯特：愿意！他会愿意的！

        泰尔：残忍的魔鬼，让父亲谋杀他自己的孩子。

        盖斯勒：如果愿意，就取下你的镣铐。

        泰尔：这不是亲手谋杀吗？

        盖斯勒：你同意吗？

        阿尔伯特：他同意。（盖斯勒对身边士兵示意，士兵上前打开他的镣铐，泰尔对他们的行为茫然不知）

        泰尔：亲手谋杀，谋杀自己儿子？用这双手？我自己的双手？儿子小时候，我用手牵他走路，这实在太可怕，难以想象的罪恶。简直是残暴无耻！（镣铐已被打开）你们对我做了什么？你们这群混蛋！把我的锁链戴好！我的手没有沾上血，没有血污的腥味，但现在却要结束亲身儿子的性命，就用这双手！不！我不会为盖斯勒那恶魔杀害我的孩子。

        阿尔伯特：爸爸！爸爸！你不会射中我的，爸爸！

        泰尔：射中？射出的箭能穿透你的脑袋；偏一点，就会射中你的眼睛；躲过眼睛，又会射穿你的脸，我看过你妈妈亲吻多少次的那张小嘴；或者刺过你的头发，那简直就是挖你妈妈的心肝呀！



              盖斯勒：你愿意吗？

        泰尔：把我的箭和箭袋给我。

        盖斯勒：想好了？

        泰尔：我要杀死我的儿子。

        阿尔伯特：不，爸爸，不要！救救我！你一定要射中那个苹果.你难道不愿意救我吗？

        泰尔：我要做，我要试试。

        阿尔伯特：谢谢爸爸！

        泰尔：谢谢我？你知道为什么？孩子，我不会沦陷为试验品，抱着孩子走到他母亲那里，在她的眼前放下儿子的尸体！

        盖斯勒：不然的话，他现在就得死，你确实在谋害你的儿子，不过，你只有一次机会，试，还是不试？

        泰尔：好，我来，我要试试。

        阿尔伯特：爸爸！

        泰尔：不要和我说话！不要让我听见你的声音，你必须一声不吭，周围不能有哪怕丁点声音，所有的人都不能出声，还有圣灵——除非上天的雷能够目睹这一罪恶，一道电闪雷鸣就将这里彻底炸翻！把我的箭和箭袋给我！

        盖斯勒：准备好了吗？

        泰尔：是的！——我必须沉着冷静地射中目标！不要动，孩子！不要和我说话，坚持住！

        （幕落）





        LESSON 68





WILLIAM TELL(CONCLUDED)




        威廉·泰尔（结束篇）



         SCENE 2.—Enter slowly, people in evident distress—Officers, Sarnem, Gesler, Tell, Albert, and soldiers--one bearing Tell’s bow and quiver—another with a basket of apples.





        Ges. That is your ground. Now shall they measure thence

         A hundred paces. Take the distance.

        Tell. Is the line a true one?

        Ges. True or not, what is’t to thee?

        Tell. What is’t to me? A little thing.

         A very little thing; a yard or two

         Is nothing here or there—were it a wolf

         I shot at! Never mind.

        Ges. Be thankful, slave,

         Our grace accords thee life on any terms.

        Tell. I will be thankful, Gesler! Villain, stop!

         You measure to the sun.

        Ges. And what of that?

         What matter whether to or from the sun?

        Tell. I’d have it at my back. The sun should shine

         Upon the mark, and not on him that shoots.

         I can not see to shoot against the sun:

         I will not shoot against the sun!

        Ges. Give him his way! Thou hast cause to bless my mercy.

        Tell. I shall remember it. I’d like to see

         The apple I'm to shoot at.

        Ges. Stay! show me the basket! there!

        Tell. You’ve picked the smallest one.

        Ges. I know I have.

        Tell. Oh, do you? But you see

         The color of it is dark: I’d have it light,

         To see it better.

        Ges. Take it as it is;

         Thy skill will be the greater if thou hitt’st it.

        Tell. True! true! I did not think of that; I wonder

         I did not think of that. Give me some chance

         To save my boy!—



               I will not murder him,

         If I can help it—for the honor of

         The form thou wearest, if all the heart is gone.

         (Throws away the apple with all his force.)

        Ges. Well: choose thyself.

        Tell. Have I a friend among the lookers-on?

        Verner. (Rushing forward.) Here, Tell.

        Tell. I thank thee, Verner!

         He is a friend runs out into a storm

         To shake a hand with us. I must be brief.

         When once the bow is bent, we can not take

         The shot too soon. Verner, whatever be

         The issue of this hour, the common cause

         Must not stand still. Let not to-morrow’s sun

         Set on the tyrant’s banner! Verner! Verner!

         The boy! the boy! Thinkest thou he hath the courage

         To stand it?

        Ver. Yes.

        Tell. Does he tremble?

        Ver. No.

        Tell. Art sure?

        Ver. I am.

        Tell. How looks he?

        Ver. Clear and smilingly.

         If you doubt it, look yourself.

        Tell. No, no, my friend:

         To hear it is enough.

        Ver. He bears himself so much above his years—

        Tell. I know! I know!

        Ver. With constancy so modest—

        Tell. I was sure he would—

        Ver. And looks with such relying love

         And reverence upon you—

        Tell. Man! Man! Man!

         No more! Already I’m too much the father

         To act the man! Verner, no more, my friend!

         I would be flint—flint—flint. Don’t make me feel

         I’m not—do not mind me! Take the boy

         And set him, Verner, with his back to me.

         Set him upon his knees, and place this apple

         Upon his head, so that the stem may front me.

         Thus, Verner; charge him to keep steady; tell him

         I'll hit the apple! Verner, do all this

         More briefly than I tell it thee.

        Ver. Come, Albert! (Leading him out.)

        Alb. May I not speak with him before I go?

        Ver. No.



              Alb. I would only kiss his hand.

        Ver. You must not.

        Alb. I must; I can not go from him without.

        Ver. It is his will you should.

        Alb. His will, is it?

         I am content, then; come.

        Tell. My boy! (Holding out his arms to him.)

        Alb. My father! (Rushing into Tell’s arms.)

        Tell. If thou canst bear it, should not I? Go now,

         My son; and keep in mind that I can shoot;

         Go, boy; be thou but steady, I will hit

         The apple. Go! God bless thee; go. My bow!

         (The bow is handed to him.)

         Thou wilt not fail thy master, wilt thou? Thou

         Hast never failed him yet, old servant. No,

         I'm sure of thee. I know thy honesty,

         Thou art stanch, stanch. Let me see my quiver.

        Ges. Give him a single arrow.

        Tell. Do you shoot?

        Soldier. I do.

        Tell. Is it so you pick an arrow, friend?

         The point, you see, is bent; the feather, jagged.

         That’s all the use’t is fit for. (Breaks it.)

        Ges. Let him have another.

        Tell. Why,’t is better than the first,

         But yet not good enough for such an aim

         As I’m to take. ’T is heavy in the shaft;

         I'll not shoot with it! (Throws it away.) Let

         me see my quiver.

         Bring it!’T is not one arrow in a dozen

         I’d take to shoot with at a dove, much less

         A dove like that.

        Ges. It matters not.

         Show him the quiver.

        Tell. See if the boy is ready.

         (Tell here hides an arrow under his vest.)

        Ver. He is.

        Tell. I’m ready too! Keep silent, for

         Heaven’s sake, and do not stir; and let me have

         Your prayers, your prayers, and be my witnesses

         That if his life’s in peril from my hand,

         ’Tis only for the chance of saving it. (To the people.)

        Ges. Go on.

        Tell. I will.

         O friends, for mercy’s sake keep motionless

         and silent. (Tell shoots. A shout of exultation

         bursts from the crowd. Tell’s head drops on his



               bosom; he with difficulty supports him—

         self on his bow.)

        Ver. (Rushing in with Albert.) The boy is safe, no

         hair of him is touched.

        Alb. Father, I’m safe. Your Albert’s safe, dear father.

         Speak to me! Speak to me!

        Ver. He can not, boy!

        Alb. You grant him life?

        Ges. I do.

        Alb. And we are free?

        Ges. You are. (Crossing angrily behind.)

        Alb. Open his vest,

         And give him air. (Albert opens his father’s vest,

         and the arrow drops. Tell starts, fixes his eyes

         on Albert and clasps him to his breast.)

        Tell. My boy! My boy!

        Ges. For what

         Hid you that arrow in your breast? Speak, slave!

        Tell. To kill thee, tyrant, had I slain my boy!


【中文阅读】

        第二幕：众人看来心情沮丧，慢步走了过来，包括众官吏、萨勒姆、盖斯勒，还有泰尔和阿尔伯特及士兵们，其中一位士兵拿着泰尔的箭和箭袋，另外一位士兵拿着一袋苹果。





        盖斯勒：那是你站的地方。然后，士兵们从那测出一百码距离，以此距离计算。



        泰尔：那条线可靠吗？

        盖斯勒：是否可靠，对你来说，又怎么样呢？

        泰尔：对我来说怎么样？这事很小，应该不值一提；不管怎么说，相差一两码距离实在算不上什么，假如我的射击目标为野兽，那完全不必介意。

        盖斯勒：要知道感恩，你这奴隶！无论如何，我们在对你施以恩典。

        泰尔：我会感激在心，盖斯勒，你这个恶棍！停下！你量到太阳上去了。

        盖斯勒：你什么意思？这距离与太阳有什么关系？

        泰尔：我得背着太阳，阳光应该照在目标上，不是直接照射在射箭人的脸上。迎着光线怎么行，我绝对不能面对阳光射箭！

        盖斯勒：给他调换方向！你要感激我的慈悲。



              泰尔：我会记住，我还想看看马上射箭需要的苹果。

        盖斯勒：等一会，把那个苹果篮拿来！这里！

        泰尔：你挑选个最小的苹果。

        盖斯勒：是的。

        泰尔：噢，看呀。你看这苹果颜色太暗，我想要个颜色亮丽点的，才能看得更清楚。

        盖斯勒：就这苹果吧，假如你能射中，岂不说明你本事更大？

        泰尔：不错，太对了！我没有想到这点，很奇怪，我怎么没想到？我不会杀害我的孩子，如果我能为你佩剑身份的荣誉帮上什么忙，如果你还有一点悲悯的话，多给我些机会救救我的孩子！

        （使出全力将那苹果扔掉。）



        盖斯勒：好吧，让你自己挑吧。

        泰尔：这里有人能帮忙吗？

        弗纳：（冲上前。）我可以帮忙，泰尔。

        泰尔：谢谢你，弗纳！

        你是一位冲进暴风雨里帮助我们的朋友。这里，我必须简单说些需要注意的事。一旦弓被拉弯，我还不能随即放箭。弗纳，问题关键在于，无论如何必须确保孩子站在原地一动不动，绝不能让明天的太阳照耀在暴君的旗帜上！弗纳，拜托你了！孩子，我的孩子，你觉得他有勇气站在那吗？

        弗纳：他有勇气。

        泰尔：他会发抖吗？

        弗纳：不会。

        泰尔：你确信吗？

        弗纳：我确信。

        泰尔：他现在怎么样？

        弗纳：他的头脑很清楚，露出微笑。如果不信，不妨看看你自己。

        泰尔：不，不，我信。听到这些，我真的足以欣慰了。

        弗纳：这些年，这孩子吃过很多苦，超过他同龄的孩子。

        泰尔：是的，我清楚！

        弗纳：他一直那么谦卑。

        泰尔：是的，我相信。

        弗纳：看起来，对你那么依恋，那么景仰崇敬你。



              泰尔：你真是好心，大好人呀！什么也别再说了，作为父亲，我实在感到太多的愧意。弗纳，不多说了，我的朋友。我要准备放箭了，快了，就要开始了，别让我感到不在状态。别干扰我！看好孩子，叮嘱好他，弗纳，让他背朝着我，让他跪下。把苹果放到他头上，将苹果摆放端正。弗纳，务必让孩子心态稳定，告诉他我会击中那个苹果！弗纳，尽量做得比我告诉你的更简单。

        弗纳：过来，阿尔伯特！（领他走出。）

        阿尔伯特：我离开前，不能和爸爸说话吗？

        弗纳：不能，孩子。

        阿尔伯特：我只是想亲亲他的手。

        弗纳：不能。

        阿尔伯特：我实在想他，见不到爸爸，我不想走。

        弗纳：这是你爸爸说的，你该听话。

        阿尔伯特：我爸爸说的？是吗？那我愿意，好的，走吧。

        泰尔：我的孩子！（向孩子伸出胳膊。）

        弗纳：爸爸！（冲着泰尔跑过来，扑起他的怀里。）



        泰尔：如果你能勇敢地承受劫难，难道我更不应该坚持吗？去吧，孩子，记着，千万别动。我会射中那苹果！快去！上帝保佑你！去吧，把我的弓给我！（弓被递到他的手中。）弓箭呀，你不会让你的主人失望，好吗？你也从未让他失望，我的老伙计。我相信你，你很忠诚，也很强壮有力，让我再看看箭袋。



        盖斯勒：一支箭就够了！

        泰尔：你射箭吗？

        士兵：是的。

        泰尔：朋友，这是你挑的箭？你看，箭头已经弯了，箭翎也有破损，我不会用这样的弓箭的。（将箭折断）



        盖斯勒：再给他拿支箭。

        泰尔：好，这支比第一支好。不过，如果我要射中苹果的话，还不够好。至于这支箭，箭杆过重，还是不能用！（将其扔掉）让我看看我的箭袋，把我的箭袋拿过来！10多支中找不出一支像样的箭用来射鸽子，而苹果比鸽子又要小得多。



        盖斯勒：好吧，就让他从自己箭袋里找吧。

        泰尔：再看看孩子准备好了没有？



              （泰尔悄悄将一支箭藏进外衣。）



        弗纳：孩子准备好了。

        泰尔：（对周围人说道）我也安排妥当！请安静，以圣主名义，千万别弄出一点声响。让我接受主的祈祷，只有你的祈祷，才能见证我的儿子的安危在我的手里，这是唯一能够拯救他的机会。

        盖斯勒：开始吧。

        泰尔：好。哦，朋友们，仁慈为怀，请千万别动，务必安静。（泰尔开弓射击，人群中发出一阵欢呼声。泰尔的头耷拉胸前，他费了很大力气，才扶住弓弩站住。）



        弗纳：（带着阿尔伯特冲了过来）孩子没事，毫发无伤。

        阿尔伯特：爸爸，我很好，你的阿尔伯特一点事也没有，亲爱的爸爸。

        你快说话，快说话呀！

        弗纳：孩子，让他歇一会。

        阿尔伯特：先生，你饶恕他的性命了？

        盖斯勒：是的。

        阿尔伯特：我和爸爸都自由了？

        盖斯勒：是的。（暗中极为气愤）



        阿尔伯特：快解开他的外套，让他喘喘气。（阿尔伯特解开父亲外衣，那支箭掉在地上，泰尔猛然一愣，眼睛盯着阿尔伯特，一把将他搂进怀里）



        泰尔：我的儿子，我的儿子！

        盖斯勒：你在胸口藏那支箭做什么？说，你这奴隶！

        泰尔：如果我失手杀害了我的孩子，这支箭就留给你这个暴君！





        LESSON 69





THE CRAZY ENGINEER


        癫狂的火车司机

        1. My train left Dantzic in the morning generally about eight o’clock; but once a week we had to wait for the arrival of the steamer from Stockholm. It was the morning of the steamer’s arrival that I came down from the hotel, and found that my engineer had been so seriously injured that he could not perform his work. I went immediately to the engine house to procure another engineer, for I supposed there were three or four in reserve there, but I was disappointed.

        2. I heard the puffing of the steamer, and the passengers would be on hand in fifteen minutes. I ran to the guards and asked them if they knew where there was an engineer, but they did not. I then went to the firemen and asked them if anyone of them felt competent[46] to run the engine to Bromberg. No one dared to attempt it. The distance was nearly one hundred miles. What was to be done?

        3. The steamer stopped at the wharf, and those who were going on by rail came flocking to the station. They had eaten breakfast on board the boat, and were all ready for a fresh start. The train was in readiness in the long station house, and the engine was steaming and puffing away impatiently in the distant firing house.

        4. It was past nine o’clock. “Come, why don’t we start?” growled an old, fat Swede, who had been watching me narrowly for the last fifteen minutes. And upon this there was a general chorus of anxious inquiry, which soon settled to downright murmuring. At this juncture[47] some one touched me on the elbow. I turned, and saw a stranger by my side. I thought that he was going to remonstrate[48] with me for my backwardness. In fact, I began to have strong temptations to pull off my uniform, for every anxious eye was fixed upon the glaring badges which marked me as the chief officer of the train.

        5. However, this stranger was a middle-aged man, tall and stout, with a face of great energy and intelligence. His eye was black and brilliant,—so brilliant that I could not gaze steadily into it, though I tried; and his lips, which were very thin, seemed more like polished marble than human flesh. His dress was black throughout, and not only set with exact nicety, but was scrupulously clean and neat.

        6. “You want an engineer, I understand,” he said in a low, cautious tone, at the same time gazing quietly about him, as though he wanted no one to hear what he said.

        “I do,” I replied. “My train is all ready, and we have no engineer within twenty miles of this place.”

        “Well, sir, I am going to Bromberg; I must go, and I will run the engine for you.”

        “Ha!” I uttered, “are you an engineer?”



              “I am, sir—one of the oldest in the country—and am now on my way to make arrangements for a great improvement I have invented for the application of steam to a locomotive. My name is Martin Kroller. If you wish, I will run as far as Bromberg; and I will show you running that is running.”

        7. Was I not fortunate? I determined to accept the man’s offer at once, and so I told him. He received my answer with a nod and a smile. I went with him to the house, where we found the engine in charge of the fireman, and all ready for a start. Kroller got upon the platform, and I followed him. I had never seen a man betray such a peculiar aptness[49] amid machinery as he did. He let on the steam in an instant, but yet with care and judgment, and he backed up to the baggage carriage with the most exact nicety.

        8. I had seen enough to assure me that he was thoroughly acquainted with the business, and I felt composed[50] once more. I gave my engine up to the new man, and then hastened away to the office. Word was passed for all the passengers to take their seats, and soon afterward I waved my hand to the engineer. There was a puff, a groaning of the heavy axletrees, a trembling of the building, and the train was in motion. I leaped upon the platform of the guard carriage, and in a few minutes more the station house was far behind us.

        9. In less than an hour we reached Dirschau, where we took up the passengers, that had come on the Konigsberg railway. Here I went forward and asked Kroller how he liked the engine. He replied that he liked it very much.

        “But,” he added, with a strange sparkling of the eye, “wait until I get my improvement, and then you will see traveling. Why, I could run an engine of my construction to the moon in four and twenty hours?”

        10. I smiled at what I thought his enthusiasm, and then went back to my station. As soon as the Konigsberg passengers were all on board, and their baggage carriage attached, we started on again. Soon after, I went into the guard carriage and sat down. An early train from Konigsberg had been through two hours before, and was awaiting us at Little Oscue, where we took on board the Western mail.





              11. “How we go,” uttered one of the guards, some fifteen minutes after we had left Dirschau.

        “The new engineer is trying the speed,” I replied, not yet having any fear. But ere long I began to apprehend[51] he was running a little too fast. The carriages began to sway to and fro, and I could hear exclamations of fright from the passengers.

        “Good heavens!” cried one of the guards, coming in at that moment, “what is that fellow doing? Look, sir, and see how we are going.”

        12. I looked at the window, and found that we were dashing along at a speed never before traveled on that road. Posts, fences, rocks, and trees flew by in one undistinguished mass, and the carriages now swayed fearfully. I started to my feet, and met a passenger on the platform. He was one of the chief owners of our road, and was just on his way to Berlin. He was pale and excited.

        13. “Sir,” he gasped, “is Martin Kroller on the engine?”

        “Yes,” I told him.

        “What! didn’t you know him?”

        “Know?” I repeated, somewhat puzzled; “what do you mean? He told me his name was Kroller, and that he was an engineer. We had no one to run the engine, and—”

        “You took him!” interrupted the man. “Good heavens, sir, he is as crazy as a man can be! He turned his brain over a new plan for applying steam power. I saw him at the station, but did not fully recognize him, as I was in a hurry. Just now one of your passengers told me that your engineers were all gone this morning, and that you found one that was a stranger to you. Then I knew the man whom I had seen was Martin Kroller. He had escaped from the hospital at Stettin. You must get him off somehow.”

        14. The whole fearful truth was now open to me. The speed of the train was increasing every moment, and I knew that a few more miles per hour would launch us all into destruction. I called to the guard and then made my way forward as quickly as possible. I reached the back platform of the tender[52], and there stood Kroller upon the engine board, his hat and coat off, his long black hair floating wildly in the wind, his shirt unbuttoned at the front, his sleeves rolled up, with a pistol in his teeth, and thus glaring upon the fireman, who lay motionless upon the fuel. The furnace was stuffed till the very latch of the door was red-hot, and the whole engine was quivering and swaying as though it would shiver to pieces.

        15. “Kroller! Kroller!” I cried, at the top of my voice. The crazy engineer started, and caught the pistol in his hand. Oh, how those great black eyes glared, and how ghastly and frightful the face looked!

        “Ha! ha! ha!” he yelled demoniacally, glaring upon me like a roused lion.

        “They said that I could not make it! But see! see! See my new power! See my new engine! I made it, and they are jealous of me! I made it, and when it was done, they stole it from me. But I have found it! For years I have been wandering in search of my great engine, and they said it was not made. But I have found it! I knew it this morning when I saw it at Dantzic, and I was determined to have it. And I’ve got it! Ho! ho! ho! we’re on the way to the moon, I say! We’ll be in the moon in four and twenty hours. Down, down, villain! If you move, I’ll shoot you.”

        This was spoken to the poor fireman, who at that moment attempted to rise, and the frightened man sank back again.



              16. “Here’s Little Oscue just before us,” cried out one of the guard. But even as he spoke, the buildings were at hand. A sickening sensation settled upon my heart, for I supposed that we were now gone. The houses flew by like lightning. I knew if the officers here had turned the switch as usual, we should be hurled into eternity in one fearful crash. I saw a flash,—it was another engine,—I closed my eyes; but still we thundered on! The officers had seen our speed, and knowing that we would not be able to stop, in that distance, they had changed the switch, so that we went forward.

        17. But there was sure death ahead, if we did not stop. Only fifteen miles from us was the town of Schwetz, on the Vistula; and at the rate we were going we should be there in a few minutes, for each minute carried us over a mile. The shrieks of the passengers now rose above the crash of the rails, and more terrific than all else arose the demoniac yells of the mad engineer.

        “Merciful heavens!” gasped the guardsman, “there’s not a moment to lose; Schwetz is close. But hold,” he added; “let’s shoot him.”

        18. At that moment a tall, stout German student came over the platform where we stood, and saw that the madman had his heavy pistol aimed at us. He grasped a huge stick of wood, and, with a steadiness of nerve which I could not have commanded, he hurled it with such force and precision[53] that he knocked the pistol from the maniac’s hand. I saw the movement, and on the instant that the pistol fell, I sprang forward, and the German followed me. I grasped the man by the arm; but I should have been nothing in his mad power, had I been alone. He would have hurled me from the platform, had not the student at that moment struck him upon the head with a stick of wood, which he caught as he came over the tender.

        19. Kroller settled down like a dead man, and on the next instant I shut off the steam and opened the valve. As the free steam shrieked and howled in its escape, the speed began to decrease, and in a few minutes more the danger was passed. As I settled back, entirely overcome by the wild emotions that had raged within me, we began to turn the river; and before I was fairly recovered, the fireman had stopped the train in the station house at Schwetz.

        20. Martin Kroller, still insensible, was taken from the platform; and, as we carried him to the guard room, one of the guard recognized him, and told us that he had been there about two weeks before.

        “He came,” said the guard, “and swore that an engine which stood near by was his. He said it was one he had made to go to the moon in, and that it had been stolen from him. We sent for more help to arrest him, and he fled.”

        “Well,” I replied, with a shudder, “I wish he had approached me in the same way; but he was more cautious at Dantzic.”

        At Schwartz we found an engineer to run the engine to Bromberg; and having taken out the western mail for the next northern mail to carry along, we saw that Kroller would be properly attended to, and then started on.

        21. The rest of the trip we ran in safety, though I could see the passengers were not wholly at ease, and would not be until they were entirely clear of the railway. Martin Kroller remained insensible from the effects of the blow nearly two weeks; and when he recovered from that, he was sound again; his insanity was all gone. I saw him about three weeks afterward, but he had no recollection of me. He remembered nothing of the past year, not even his mad freak on my engine. But I remembered it, and I remember it still; and the people need never fear that I shall be imposed upon again by a crazy engineer.

        1．火车在八点左右离开丹兹克，每周仅一个班次，通常，火车要等来自斯德哥尔摩的轮船上下船乘客上车后发车。今天早上，轮船抵达后，我从宾馆走出，发现当班的火车司机伤势严重，显然已不能正常上班，我立即赶去机车库，想找位司机顶班，我原以为机车库会有三四位机动司机，但是最后只有失望而归。



        2．听见汽轮发出巨大汽笛声，一刻钟后，旅客们将抵达车站。我向警卫处跑去，咨询他们是否他们知道哪里能找到火车司机，他们无从应答。接着，我又跑去锅炉班，询问他们是否了解有人能充任司机，将火车一路开到布朗伯格。大家面面相觑，无人敢试。从丹兹克到布朗伯格行程几乎一百英里，接下来该怎么办？



        3．轮船已经泊靠码头，那些准备赶火车的旅客朝火车站蜂拥而来。旅客们在船上吃完早餐，正准备迎接新的一天。火车卧在长长的站房前，一切准备就绪，远处车头冒出白烟，不耐烦地噗噗吼着。

        4．九点已过。“嗨！为什么还不开车？”一位年迈肥胖的瑞典人向我吼叫，他一直仔细地打量我，差不多直直盯了一刻钟。随后，周围一片质问叹气冲着我嚷起，很快变成了成群抱怨。恰好那时，有人用肘碰了碰我，转身一看，身边站着位陌生人，我以为，他将指责为何拖延开车时间。其实当时，我真想一把扯掉身上的制服，因为，每一双焦虑眼睛无不注视我制服上佩戴的列车长佩章。

        5．那位陌生的中年人，身材高大、壮实，看起来精力充沛、富有睿智。望着他那双黝黑闪亮的眼睛，亮得似乎无法凝视片刻，直入深处。他的嘴唇很薄，看来更像抛光后的大理石。他全身上下黑色装束，服装极为考究，洁净笔挺。

        6．“我知道，你需要一位火车司机。”他开口对我说，声音低沉，言语谨慎，同时冷静地环顾着周围，好像不希望有人听见我们之间的对话。

        “确实需要。”我说道，“火车就要开了，这地方方圆二十英里内却找不到一位司机。”

        “哦，是这样。先生，我将去布朗伯格，一定要坐这班车走，我来给你开车。”



        “太好了！”我开口问，“你是司机？”

        “当然，先生，我可是这个国家资格最老的司机——我正在从事自己研发的如何将蒸气应用到机车项目的重大改进，我叫马丁 · 克罗尔。如果你愿意，我可以将火车开到布朗伯格，我要让你看看什么叫跑起来的火车。”

        7．天呀，我难道不够走运？我决定接受那位陌生人的请求，因此便一口应允下来，他笑着点了下头，表示赞同我的认可。接着，我带他去了站台机车处，在那里见到了当班的锅炉工，他已为火车启程做好了所有准备。随后，克罗尔先生登上了机车驾驶厢，我紧紧跟随着他，迄今为止，我还从未见过其他人能像他那样具有非凡的掌控机器才能，他一边迅捷地查看蒸汽阀，一边小心翼翼地观察；然后，他来到极为整洁有序的行李车厢查看。



              8．我转了一圈，目睹了他的实际操作能力，心中顿时如释重负，感到踏实多了。我将火车运行大权交与这位新人，然后准备匆忙离开赶去处理公事。当时车上广播正播放通知，嘱咐所有旅客尽快回到座位坐好，很快，我便与那位新司机挥手作别。机车噗噗声愈发大声响起，笨重的火车轴轮发出刺耳的吱嘎吱嘎声，周围空气随之颤动起来，火车终于启动了。我跨上警卫队车厢，不过片刻，机车房便远远消失身后。

        9．不到一个钟头，我们已抵达德肖，火车停站，上来一些旅客，火车接着驶往哥尼斯堡，我前去找马丁，想询问他对驾驶这列机车的感觉，他回答中透出非常满意的神情。

        “不过，”他接着说，眼里闪出奇异的光泽，“一旦我的改造完成，你才可以领略真正的旅行。哎呀，那时我才能开着自己研发的火车一天内到达月球。”

        10．我笑了起来，他可真够大胆激情，随后我返回车厢。哥尼斯堡站上旅客全部上车后，行李箱挂接完毕，火车又开动了。不一会，我走进警卫车厢坐下，一列来自哥尼斯堡的早班火车两小时前已经驶过，在小奥斯卡站等着我们，在那里，我们将发往西部的邮包装上车。

        11．火车离开德肖大约一刻钟后，“怎么回事？”一位警卫问道。

        “新来的司机正在测速。”我顺口回答，没有任何异常感觉。不多久，我的内心开始隐隐不安，这位新人开得实在有点太快了。这时，车厢开始前后摇摆，我甚至听到了旅客们恐惧的尖叫。

        “天啊！”一位警卫随即叫着，“那家伙在做什么？先生，看看这车怎么跑的？”



        12．我朝窗外望去，火车正以从未有过的速度箭一般向前飞驰，那些无法辨清的标杆、栅栏、山体以及树木统统呼啸而过，车厢摇摆愈发让人恐惧。我离开车厢，在过道遇到一位旅客，他是我们那条铁路投资的一家大股东，当时正准备前往柏林。此刻，他脸色煞白，情绪极为激动。

        13．“先生，”他倒抽了一口凉气，“难道是马丁 · 克罗尔在开车？”

        “不错，正是他。”我对他说。

        “天呀，你难道不知道他？”

        “怎么回事？”我再次询问，有点丈二和尚摸不着头脑，“你说的什么意思？他对我说，他叫马丁·克罗尔，是位火车司机。当时，我们找不到火车司机，而且——”



              “你就让他来开！”他打断了我的话，“我的老天，先生，这家伙简直疯狂得不可理喻！他绞尽脑汁地策划一项蒸气动力的新计划，我在站台房见到他，由于当时匆忙，我没有看清。刚才一位乘客告诉我，今天早上，你的火车司机们全都不在，于是你找到一位陌生人，我马上意识到，我遇见的那人正是马丁 · 克罗尔，他是从斯德丁的医院里逃出来的，不管怎样，你要尽快让他将火车停下来。”

        14．可怕的真相就在我的面前，火车仍然还在分分秒秒加速，加速。我清楚，每小时提速不过数英里的列车亦足以带我们大家走向坟墓。我招呼一位警卫过来，然后尽快赶去机车。我走到供给车厢操作台后端，马丁站在引擎室旁边，他的帽子和外套脱掉了，长长的黑发在风中杂乱飞舞，衬衫纽扣也解开了，袖口高高挽起，嘴里居然还衔着一把枪。他的眼珠瞪着溜圆，直勾勾地看着那位锅炉工，那位工人手脚不停，正忙着给机车添加燃料，炉膛已塞得满满当当，门闩也烧得通红，整列火车颤抖摇晃着，好像立马要散了架似的。

        15．“克罗尔！克罗尔！”我声嘶力竭地叫着，那位疯狂的司机愣了一下，将手枪用手接住。天呀，那双瞪如牛铃的黑眼睛扑闪着，那脸看起来那么可怖惨白！

        “哈！哈！哈！”他魔鬼般嘶叫着， 像一头醒狮那样瞪视我。

        “他们说我无法做到！可是，看呀！看呀！看我新的机车！看我新的发动机！我创造出新的速度，他们嫉妒死我了！这是我的功劳，所有发明完成后，他们从我这偷走技术，可是我，才是这一发明的主人。多年来，我一直到处寻找我那了不起的发动机，他们一直说那是不可能造出来的，就在今天早上，就在丹兹克，我终于找到了，我决心拥有它，我总算成功了。嗬！ 嗬！ 嗬！我们已在去月球的路上了。我宣布，我们将在24小时后抵达月球。蹲下，蹲下，你这个浑蛋！如果你再敢动一下，我就开枪。”

        此刻，那可怜的锅炉工正想立身站起，听见克罗尔的疯狂吼叫，吓得连忙匍匐在地，不敢动弹。

        16．“我们前方就是小奥斯卡。”一名警卫情急中喊道，说时迟，那时快，那些建筑群已扑面而来。我心里泛起一阵恶心，我清楚或许我们已踏上了不归路，房舍箭一般飞快掠过。我知道，此处站台的执勤官如果像往常那样转动手柄，火车势必引起可怕碰撞，我们一车人就将彻底完蛋。我看见一道闪光，那是另一列火车，——我不由得闭上了双眼，可火车仍在闪电般奔驰。站台执勤官觉察到我们这列火车速度不同寻常，知道我们无法停止，隔着老远，他们便变换了岔道，整节列车才得以继续冲向前方。

        17．如果列车不停止的话，前方仍然遭遇死亡。此时，我们距离位于维斯的希维切镇只有15英里了。以目前速度计算，几分钟内我们即可到达，因为此刻列车速度已达到每分钟一英里以上。铁轨剧烈的碰撞声激起旅客们的尖叫，远远比那位着魔般疯狂、不停嘶喊的司机更为恐怖。



              “仁慈的上帝！”警卫气喘吁吁地说，“几乎没有时间了，希维切快到了，抓牢点。”他接着说，“我来枪击他！”

        18．就在那时，一位高大健壮学生模样的德国人走到我们站立的过道，看到那疯子正用沉重的手枪对准我们，那学生抓起一块大砖木，屏气凝神片刻，准确猛力地砸向那疯子手里的手枪，一道我来不及下令的闪电出手，就在那惊心动魄的刹那，手枪落地了，我猛扑向前，那位德国学生紧接身后，我抓住克罗尔的胳膊，假如我独自一人，或许根本无法制服他的疯狂举动；如果身边德国学生不用那块砖木猛击他的头部，那根他走到过道时顺手操起的木块，克罗尔很可能将我用力摔出过道。

        19．克罗尔像具尸体应声瘫倒在地，我即刻关闭了蒸汽开关，打开阀门。逸出的蒸汽尖锐地嘶叫着，火车开始慢慢地减速。几分钟后，危险排除了。我仰坐在地，内心完全陷入狂噪不安的暴怒。火车绕过那条河，我尚未完全恢复到正常状态，待回过神来，那位锅炉工已将火车停在了希维切车站的站台上。

        20．此刻马丁仍然不省人事，我们将他从火车上抬下，然后送到车站警卫室，一位警卫认出了他。他告诉我们，大约两星期前，克罗尔曾来过希维切。

        “这人来后，”那位警卫说，“指天发誓说停放附近的那辆机车是他的，他还说，那是他自造的发动机，准备开往月球，后来却被人偷走了。我们动用了相当警力展开抓捕，但他还是逃脱了。”

        “原来如此，”我感慨万分，心中仍然不寒而栗，“他当时也以类似的方式接近我，那该多好！不过，在丹兹克他更加小心谨慎了。”

        在希维切，我们得以找到一位火车司机，负责去布朗伯格的剩下路程。列车卸下那些西去邮件，等待下趟北去的邮车，我们也知道马丁·克罗尔将会受到精心关照，就这样，火车再度鸣笛上路了。

        在希维切，我们找到了火车司机，负责驾驶去布朗伯格的剩余路程，列车卸下那些西去邮件，等待下趟去北路的邮件可以顺便捎带，我们也看到马丁·克罗尔接受到良好治疗，我们又重新上路了。

        21．接下来的路程相当平稳顺畅，尽管我看见旅客们未必彻底放心，哪怕对铁轨的恐惧彻底消除后，他们亦未必心安。马丁·克罗克由于外物重击失去知觉大约两周之久，身体逐步恢复后，他已经安然无恙，所幸的是，他的精神不再错乱，意识也恢复正常了。三周后，我再次见到了马丁·克罗克，但他根本记不起我了，也记不起过去的事情，甚至包括那列火车上发生的所有荒诞行为。然而，我还记得，直到今天也一直铭记在心。民众需要的并非恐惧，而我，却凭借一位癫狂司机的手，将其强加到他们身上。





        LESSON 70





THE HERITAGE


        遗 产

        James Russell Lowell (b. 1819, d.1891) was born in Cambridge, Mass., and was graduated from Harvard College. He entered the profession of law; but, in 1843, turned aside to publish “The Pioneer, a Literary and Critical Magazine.” In 1855 he was appointed professor of Belles-lettres in Harvard College. From 1877 to 1885 he was U.S. Minister, first to Spain, afterwards to Great Britain. Lowell’s powers as a writer were very versatile, and his poems range from the most dreamy and imaginative to the most trenchant and witty. Among his most noted poetical works are “The Biglow Papers,” “A Fable for Critics,” “The Vision of Sir Launfal,” “The Cathedral,” and “The Legend of Brittany;” while “Conversations on some of the Old Poets,” “Among my Books,” and “My Study Windows,” place him in the front rank as an essayist.

        1. The rich man’s son inherits[54] lands,

        And piles of brick, and stone, and gold,

        And he inherits soft white hands,

        And tender flesh that fears the cold,

        Nor dares to wear a garment old;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        One scarce would wish to hold in fee.





        2. The rich man’s son inherits cares;

        The bank may break, the factory burn,

        A breath may burst his bubble shares,

        And soft white hands could hardly earn

        A living that would serve his turn;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        One scarce would wish to hold in fee.





        3. The rich man’s son inherits wants,

        His stomach craves for dainty fare;

        With sated[55] heart, he hears the pants

        Of toiling hinds[56] with brown arms bare!

        And wearies in his easy-chair;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        One scarce would wish to hold in fee.





        4. What doth the poor man’s son inherit?

        Stout muscles and a sinewy heart,

        A hardy frame, a hardier spirit;

        King of two hands, he does his part

        In every useful toil and art;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        A king might wish to hold in fee.





        5. What doth the poor man’s son inherit?

        Wishes o’erjoyed with humble things,

        A rank adjudged[57] by toil-won merit,

        Content that from employment springs,

        A heart that in his labor sings;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        A king might wish to hold in fee.





        6. What doth the poor man’s son inherit?

        A patience learned of being poor,

        Courage, if sorrow come, to bear it,

        A fellow-feeling that is sure

        To make the outcast bless his door;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        A king might wish to hold in fee.





        7. O rich man’s son! there is a toil

        That with all others level stands:

        Large charity doth never soil,

        But only whiten soft, white hands,—

        This is the best crop from thy lands;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        Worth being rich to hold in fee.





        8. O poor man’s son! scorn not thy state;

        There is worse weariness than thine

        In merely being rich and great:

        Toil only gives the soul to shine,

        And makes rest fragrant and benign[58];

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        Worth being poor to hold in fee.





        9. Both, heirs to some six feet of sod,

        Are equal in the earth at last;

        Both, children of the same dear God,

        Prove title to your heirship vast



              By record of a well-filled past;

        A heritage, it seems to me,

        Well worth a life to hold in fee.

        LESSON 71





NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT LABOR


        不经风雨，怎见彩虹

        William Wirt (b. 1772, d. 1834) was born in Bladensburg, Md. He was admitted to the bar in 1799, and afterwards practiced law, with eminent success, at Richmond and Norfolk, Va. He was one of the counsel for the prosecution in the trial of Aaron Burr for treason. From 1817 to 1829 he was attorney-general for the United States. In 1803 he published the “Letters of a British Spy,” a work which attracted much attention, and in 1817 “A Life of Patrick Henry.”





        1. The education, moral[59] and intellectual, of every individual, must be chiefly his own work. Rely upon it that the ancients were right; both in morals and intellect we give the final shape to our characters, and thus become, emphatically, the architects[60] of our own fortune. How else could it happen that young men, who have had precisely the same opportunities, should be continually presenting us with such different results, and rushing to such opposite destinies[61]?

        2. Difference of talent will not solve it, because that difference is very often in favor of the disappointed candidate[62]. You will see issuing from the walls of the same college, nay, sometimes from the bosom of the same family, two young men, of whom one will be admitted to be a genius[63] of high order, the other scarcely above the point of mediocrity[64]; yet you will see the genius sinking and perishing in poverty, obscurity, and wretchedness; while, on the other hand, you will observe the mediocre[65] plodding his slow but sure way up the hill of life, gaining steadfast footing at every step, and mounting, at length, to eminence and distinction, an ornament to his family, a blessing to his country.



        3. Now, whose work is this? Manifestly their own. They are the architects of their respective[66] fortunes. The best seminary of learning that can open its portals to you can do no more than to afford you the opportunity of instruction; but it must depend, at last, on yourselves, whether you will be instructed or not, or to what point you will push your instruction.

        4. And of this be assured, I speak from observation a certain truth: THERE IS NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT GREAT LABOR. It is the fiat[67] of fate, from which no power of genius can absolve[68] you.



              5. Genius, unexerted, is like the poor moth that flutters around a candle till it scorches itself to death. If genius be desirable at all, it is only of that great and magnanimous kind, which, like the condor[69] of South America, pitches from the summit of Chimborazo, above the clouds, and sustains itself at pleasure in that empyreal[70] region with an energy rather invigorated than weakened by the effort.

        6. It is this capacity for high and long-continued exertion, this vigorous power of profound and searching investigation, this careering[71] and wide-spreading comprehension of mind, and these long reaches of thought, that

        “Pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,

        Or dive into the bottom of the deep,

        And pluck up drowned honor by the locks;”

        this is the prowess[72], and these the hardy achievements, which are to enroll your names among the great men of the earth.

        威廉 · 沃特(1772～1834)出生于美国马里兰州布莱登斯堡。1799年，沃特获取律师执业资格，随后从事诉讼，在弗吉尼亚州里士满和诺福克颇负盛名，在审判亚隆 · 伯尔叛国案中担任辩护律师。从1817年到1829年，他担任美国首席检察官。1803年，他发表《一名英国间谍的来信》，引起广泛关注。1817年，他的《帕特里克 · 亨利一生》出版。





        1．每个人的教育程度、道德感以及学识主要来自他的工作实践，这点毋庸置疑，古人亦不例外。通过道德与才智，我们为自己品性赋以最后定型，亦更为强调，我们才是自己命运的建筑师。对那些年轻人而言，严格说来，面临同样机遇的他们，还有决定前途的其他途径？他们仍能继续展示类似我们的不同生活道路，抑或仓促陷入截然不同的愿望悖反？

        2．天资差异无法解决这一问题，因为这种差异通常对失望的落选者更为有利。从学院墙报栏公示结果来看，有时，反对票甚至来自师出同门的同窗。两位年轻人，其中一人被公认具有天才禀赋，另外一人几乎难称平庸之才，然而，最终结局是，天才逐渐沉沦湮没一生默默无闻，贫穷困窘，处境悲惨；反之不难看到，那些平庸之辈正缓慢沉重地跋涉，最终抵达生活高处。他们每一步步履坚实，稳健有力才能够出类拔萃，成为家族的骄傲，以及国家的自豪。



              3．那么，原因究竟何在？显而易见，成功在于自己，年轻人堪为自己不同命运的设计师。一流的学业教育为你开启通往世界的大门，除却花费你能付出的金钱，为你提供铸型机会，仅此而已，绝不更多，因此，最终还是依靠你自己，无论你能否获得他人指导，或推动自己达到何等高度。

        4．我说的这一点可以确定，那是我来自观察的事实真相：不经风雨，怎见彩虹？命运法则旨在于此，没有任何天才可以逃逸或逃离其外。

        5．自发萌生的天才，有点像追逐火光的可怜飞蛾，它们不停地拍动双翼，直到完全被生生烤焦。天才是否让所有人称心如意？恐怕唯有那些高尚宽宏的慈悲之心才能做到。天才好比高踞云端的南非秃鹫，它们久久盘旋在钦博拉索山巅峰，在我们高山仰止的天国，恣意快乐地飞翔，它们与生俱来的激情四溢，并非因努力而气竭力衰。

        6．渴望升华，不懈努力，通过对充满活力的个体深入周密地调查后，我们感叹成功之道在于：快捷的行为，宽泛的理解，思想经年不变的执著，方能





        “飞天月球摘取荣誉之光；

        潜龙深海攫获珍贵声望”。





        唯有那些具有超凡勇气和惊人胆略的人，那些玉汝以成成就大业的人，方能与英雄伟人同样彪炳史册。





        LESSON 72





THE OLD HOUSE CLOCK


        老 钟

        1. Oh! the old, old clock of the household stock,

        Was the brightest thing, and neatest;

        Its hands, though old, had a touch of gold,

        And its chimes rang still the sweetest;

        ’T was a monitor, too, though its words were few,

        Yet they lived, though nations altered;

        And its voice, still strong, warned old and young,

        When the voice of friendship faltered:

        “Tick! tick!” it said, “quick, quick, to bed:

        For ten I’ve given warning;

        Up! up! and go, or else you know,

        You’ll never rise soon in the morning!”





        2. A friendly voice was that old, old clock,

        As it stood in the corner smiling,

        And blessed the time with merry chime,

        The wintry hours beguiling;

        But a cross old voice was that tiresome clock,

        As it called at daybreak boldly;

        When the dawn looked gray o’er the misty way,

        And the early air looked coldly:

        “Tick! tick!” it said, “quick out of bed:

        For five I’ve given warning;

        You’ll never have health, you’ll never have wealth,

        Unless you’re up soon in the morning!”





        3. Still hourly the sound goes round and round,

        With a tone that ceases never:

        While tears are shed for bright days fled,

        And the old friends lost forever!

        Its heart beats on, though hearts are gone

        That beat like ours, though stronger;

        Its hands still move, though hands we love

        Are clasped on earth no longer!

        “Tick! tick!” it said, “to the churchyard bed,

        The grave hath given warning;



              Up! up! and rise, and look at the skies,

        And prepare for a heavenly morning!”

        岁月监工下，耄耋老人

        目睹，历史烽烟沧桑几度。

        钟声，依然响亮悦耳，

        与生俱来音调，不曾歇息片刻，

        那些熟悉身影，已经离开很久！

        虽然身随风去，音容笑貌如旧，

        今生不再握手，气息依然徘徊；

        依恋那些双手，尚在风中挥舞；

        此生此世泯笑，断然终究难逢。

        “叮当！叮当！赶快起床，”

        时钟不断警告，催促濒死之人，

        “看看外面天空，快点走向墓地，

        伸手拥抱迎接，天堂新的日出！”

THE EXAMINATION


        考 试

        Daniel Pierce Thompson (b. 1793, d. 1868) was born at Charlestown, Mass., but soon removed with his father to Vermont, where he lived until twenty years of age, on a farm. His means of schooling were most limited, but he was very ambitious and seized every opportunity. By his own efforts he earned enough money to carry him through Middlebury College, where he graduated in 1820. He then went to Virginia as private tutor, and while there was entered at the bar. He shortly returned to Vermont, and opened a law office in Montpelier. In time he was elected a judge, and later secretary of state. From his college days Mr. Thompson was a writer for the various magazines. Among his novels may be mentioned “Locke Amsden, the Schoolmaster,” “May Martin, or the Money Diggers,” “The Green Mountain Boys,” and “The Rangers, or the Tory’s Daughter.”





        1. “Have you any questions to ask me in the other branches, sir?” asked Locke.

        “Not many,” replied Bunker. “There is reading, writing, grammar, etc., which I know nothing about; and as to them, I must, of course, take you by guess, which will not be much of a guess, after all, if I find you have thought well on all other matters. Do you understand philosophy?”

        2. “To what branch of philosophy do you allude, sir?”

        “To the only branch there is.”

        “But you are aware that philosophy is divided into different kinds; as, natural, moral, and intellectual[73].”

        “Nonsense! philosophy is philosophy, and means the study of the reasons and causes of the things which we see, whether it be applied to a crazy man’s dreams, or the roasting of potatoes. Have you attended to it?”

        “Yes, to a considerable extent, sir.”

        3. “I will put a question or two, then, if you please. What is the reason of the fact, for it is a fact, that the damp breath of a person blown on a good knife and on a bad one, will soonest disappear from the well-tempered[74] blade?”

        “It may be owing to the difference in the polish of the two blades, perhaps.” replied Locke.

        4. “Ah! that is an answer that don’t go deeper than the surface,” rejoined Bunker, humorously. “As good a thinker as you evidently are, you have not thought on this subject, I suspect. It took me a week, in all, I presume, of hard thinking, and making experiments at a blacksmith’s shop, to discover the reason of this. It is not the polish; for take two blades of equal polish, and the breath will disappear from one as much quicker than it does from the other, as the blade is better. It is because the material of the blade is more compact[75] or less porous[76] in one case than in the other.



              5. “In the first place, I ascertained that the steel was, made more compact by being hammered and tempered, and that the better it was tempered the more compact it would become; the size of the pores being made, of course, less in the same proportion. Well, then, I saw the reason I was in search of, at once. For we know a wet sponge is longer in drying than a wet piece of green wood, because the pores of the first are bigger. A seasoned or shrunk piece of wood dries quicker than a green one, for the same reason.

        6. “Or you might bore a piece of wood with large gimlet holes, and another with small ones, fill them both with water, and let them stand till the water evaporated[77], and the difference of time it would take to do this would make the case still more plain. So with the blades: the vapor lingers longest on the worst wrought and tempered one, because the pores, being larger, take in more of the wet particles, and require more time in drying.”

        7. “Your theory is at least a very ingenious[78] one,” observed Locke, “and I am reminded by it of another of the natural phenomena[79], of the true explanation of which I have not been able to satisfy myself. It is this: what makes the earth freeze harder and deeper under a trodden path than the untrodden earth around it? All that I have asked, say it is because the trodden earth is more compact. But is that reason a sufficient one?”

        8. “No,” said Bunker, “but I will tell you what the reason is, for I thought that out long ago. You know that, in the freezing months, much of the warmth we get is given out by the earth, from which, at intervals[80], if not constantly, to some extent, ascend the warm vapors to mingle with and moderate the cold atmosphere above.

        9. “Now these ascending streams of warm air would be almost wholly obstructed by the compactness of a trodden path, and they would naturally divide at some distance below it, and pass up through the loose earth on each side, leaving the ground along the line of the path, to a great depth beneath it, a cold, dead mass, through which the frost would continue to penetrate, unchecked by the internal heat, which, in its unobstructed ascent on each side, would be continually checking or overcoming the frost in its action on the earth around.

        10. “That, sir, is the true philosophy of the case, you may depend upon it. But we will now drop the discussion of these matters; for I am abundantly satisfied that you have not only knowledge enough, but that you can think for yourself. And now, sir, all I wish to know further about you is, whether you can teach others to think, which is half the battle with a teacher. But as I have had an eye on this point, while attending to the others, probably one experiment, which I will ask you to make on one of the boys here, will be all I shall want.”

        “Proceed, sir,” said the other.

        11. “Ay, sir,” rejoined Bunker, turning to the open fireplace, in which the burning wood was sending up a column of smoke, “there, you see that smoke rising, don’t you? Well, you and I know the, reason why smoke goes upward, but my youngest boy does not, I think. Now take your own way, and see if you can make him understand it.”



              12. Locke, after a moment’s reflection, and a glance round the room for something to serve for apparatus[81], took from a shelf, where he had espied a number of articles, the smallest of a set of cast-iron cart boxes, as are usually termed the round hollow tubes in which the axletree of a carriage turns. Then selecting a tin cup that would just take in the box, and turning into the cup as much water as he judged, with the box, would fill it, he presented them separately to the boy, and said,

        “There, my lad, tell me which of these is the heavier.”

        13. “Why, the cart box, to be sure,” replied the boy, taking the cup, half-filled with water, in one hand, and the hollow iron in the other.

        “Then you think this iron is heavier than as much water as would fill the place of it, do you?” resumed Locke.

        “Why, yes, as heavy again, and more too—I know it is,” promptly said the boy.

        14. “Well, sir, now mark what I do,” proceeded the former, dropping into the cup the iron box, through the hollow of which the water instantly rose to the brim of the vessel.

        “There, you saw that water rise to the top of the cup, did you?”

        “Yes, I did.”

        “Very well, what caused it to do so?”

        15. “Why, I know well enough, if I could only think: why, it is because the iron is the heavier, and as it comes all around the water so it can’t get away sideways, it is forced up.”

        “That is right; and now I want you to tell what makes that smoke rise up the chimney.”

        16. “Why,—I guess,” replied the boy, hesitating, “I guess,—I guess I don’t know.”

        “Did you ever get up in a chair to look on some high shelf, so that your head was brought near the ceiling of a heated room, in winter? and did you notice any difference between the air up there and the air near the floor?”

        17. “Yes, I remember I have, and found the air up there as warm as mustard; and when I got down, and bent my head near the floor to pick up something, I found it as cold as could be.”

        “That is ever the case; but I wish you to tell me how the cold air always happens to settle down to the lower part of the room, while the warm air, somehow, at the same time, gets above.”

        18. “Why, why, heavy things settle down, and the cold air—yes, yes, that’s it, I am sure—the cold air is heavier, and so settles down, and crowds up the warm air.”

        “Very good. You then understand that cold air is heavier than the heated air, as that iron is heavier than the water; so now we will go back to the main question—what makes the smoke go upwards?”

        19. “Oh! I see now as plain as day; the cold air settles down all round, like the iron box, and drives up the hot air as fast as the fire heats it, in the middle, like the water; and so the hot air carries the smoke along up with it, just as feathers and things in a whirlwind. Well! I have found out what makes smoke go up—is n’t it curious?”

        20. “Done like a philosopher!” cried Bunker. “The thing is settled. I will grant that you are a teacher among a thousand. You can not only think yourself, but can teach others to think; so you may call the position yours as quick as you please.”

        丹尼尔 · 皮尔斯 · 汤普森(1793～1868)，出生于美国马萨诸塞州查尔斯城，不过很快随父亲迁到佛蒙特州，直到20岁才离开，他一直住在农场。汤普森所获学业极为有限，但他志向远大，善于抓住任何机会。通过自身努力赚取足够费用后，他进入米德伯里学院学习，1820年完成学业后，他前去弗吉尼亚州任私人教师，同时获取资格进入律师界，因此他很快返回佛蒙特州，并在蒙彼利埃开办了一家律师事务所。汤普森后来被选为法官，最终成为美国国务卿。从大学开始，汤普森就开始为各类杂志写稿。他值得提及的小说包括《洛克 · 阿姆斯登校长》、《祝愿马丁或挖钱者》、《大山里的孩子》以及《游骑兵，或保守党的女儿》。





        1．“朋友，你还有其他课程的问题想问我？”洛克问道。

        “不多了，”邦克回答。“至于阅读、写作或语法等等，我是压根不懂的，当然，如果谈论这些，我只有帮你猜猜，或许根本沾不上什么边，但毕竟我可以了解到，你对其他所有问题思考是否成熟，你懂哲学吗？”

        2．“先生，你所指哪种哲学流派？”

        “哲学仅有唯一流派。”

        “但你很清楚哲学分为不同的学术分支，包括自然哲学、精神哲学以及心智哲学。”

        “扯谈！哲学就是哲学，无论是否用以痴人说梦，或者焙烤马铃薯，哲学涉猎我们所见事物推理与缘由的研究，你上过课吗？”

        “是的，学过很多，先生。”

        3．“如果乐意的话，我想请教你一或两个问题，可否谈谈，什么为事实推理，由于它基于某一事实吗？比如，一个人往优质刀片上或劣质刀片上吹气，由于优化热处理缘故，优质刀片上气息是否散发更快？”

        “造成差异的原因或许由于两片刀片抛光度的不同。”洛克回答。

        4．“哈！这答案不过涉及皮毛，”邦克幽默地接着补充。“依我看，你这位显而易见的思想敏锐者，并未考虑这一论题。我整整花费一周时间进行仔细研究，甚至在一家铁匠铺实地实验，以待查明事件的原因。问题答案与抛光没有关联，即使将两把刀片进行相同的抛光处理，两把刀片上的气息散发快慢存在明显差异；优质刀片当然要快得多，原因在于，优质刀片材料比劣质刀片材料更为密实，材质间隙更为细小。”

        5．“首先，我可以确定，通过锻打淬火，钢材才能变得密实，所以，淬火处理愈好，材料就会愈发紧固；当然，相同面积比例的材料间隙亦愈为密实，这样，我便立即弄清了研究课题的缘由。众所周知，潮湿海绵比同等面积的湿木自然干燥时间要长，因为前者空隙更大；同理，一块或小块木片要比湿木自然干燥得快。





              6．或许，你也可以拿大小不同缝隙的两块木块进行比较，将两块木头浸入水，然后取出使其直立到水蒸发干净；两块木头所需时间不同，这一点将会更清楚地阐述其中道理；刀片亦然，锻造淬火差的那把刀片，蒸汽盘桓时间更长，由于材料缝隙过大，潮湿微粒吸收更多，所需干燥的时间自然更长。”

        7．“你的理论至少是极为巧妙的，”洛克沉吟道，“由此，我联想到另外一个自然现象，对此我尚且无法得到满意的真实解释，即：踩踏道路与未经踩踏道路相比，什么原因造成前者地面比后者地面结冰坚硬厚实？我想问的是，原因在于踩踏后的地面更为密实，不过，这一理由足够充分吗？”

        8．“不，” 邦克说，“不过，我会告诉你其中原因，因为很久前我已弄清这一问题。你要知道，在结冰季节里，即使并非持续进行，我们获得的大多暖气由地面不时地往外发散，在一定程度上，暖空气上升与其上方的冷空气混合，然后减弱。”

        9．“上升的暖气流几乎被践踏后坚实路面完全阻隔，从而在地面下以某种距离自然间隔，再通过周边松软土层向上发散，使得成段路面到地表下相当深度冰冷僵硬，严霜持续从地层渗透往下，但地表下端热量无法遏制，周围上升热量无法拦阻，运动中地表周围的暖气流将与冷气流持续抗衡甚至最终成功遏制对方。

        10．“先生，这就是此事的真正原因，你当然可以相信。不过，此刻我们还是别再继续讨论这一话题，因为我对你的解释已经相当满意。你不仅具有丰富的知识，更拥有独立思考的能力。好了，先生，我希望进一步了解的是，你是否有能力教会他人思考，那是教师职业的另一半基本功。至于如何关注受教育者，我一直对此进行研究，因此，是否我可以要求你能与孩子互动，不妨做次实验证明。”

        “好吧，朋友。”洛克回答。

        11．“很好，先生，”邦克接着说，转身走向房间内打开的壁炉，火炉里的燃烧木块冒出一柱浓烟，“你看见升起的浓烟吗？你我两人都清楚烟为什么上升，但我觉得，我的最小的孩子不会明白，不妨采用你自己的方式，看看能否让他弄清来龙去脉。”

        12．沉思片刻，环顾房间四周想找点东西帮助解释，洛克突然瞥见架子上有套工具，那是一套小型铸铁手推车工具套，通常称作的圆形空心管，车轮轮轴可置入进行转动。洛克将其取下，再挑选一个锌制杯，锌杯大小恰好可将那件工具套放入，然后小心地将铸铁工具套能装的相同容积的水注入锌制杯内，再拿过铸铁工具套，分别递给孩子后询问，“好了，孩子，请告诉我，哪一个杯子更重？”



              13．“当然那只铸铁工具套重。”一只手拿着盛了一半水的锌制杯，另一只手拿着铸铁套的孩子回答。

        “你是觉得这只铸铁套比占有相同体积水的锌制杯要重，是吗？”洛克接着问。



        “是呀，再掂一下，还是觉得这只铸铁套重些。”那孩子迅速答道。

        14．“很好，孩子，现在记住我所做的，”洛克走上前，将铸铁套放入锌制杯，水立即从孔洞升到杯子边沿。

        “瞧！你看见水升到杯沿，是吗？”

        “是的。”“很好，水怎么会涨起来？”

        15．“好的，如果我仅仅这么想，我就会相当清楚明白，这是因为铁更重，当铸铁套放进锌制杯里，水无法从铸铁套周围侧面流出，只有从顶部溢出。”

        “不错，好了，我现在想让你说说，烟囱里的烟如何冒出来的？”

        16．“哎呀，让我猜猜，”孩子犹豫了片刻，接着说，“我猜——我猜猜，我不知道。”

        “你曾经站立椅子上，想要查看高处架子什么的，这样的话，你的头就得昂起靠近冬天暖气房间的天花板，你曾经关注到天花板上端气流与地面气流有什么区别吗？”

        17．“是的，我记得曾经遇见这样的事，我发现天花板上端空气非常热，但当我从椅子上下来时，我俯身将头贴近地面去捡地上掉落的东西时，我发现空气实在太凉。”

        “情况正是如此，不过，我希望你能告诉我，为什么冷空气总是在房间下端，而暖空气总在房间上端？”

        18．“哎呀，对，重的东西下沉，比如冷空气，不错，不错，就是这样，我相信，冷空气更重，所以它就往下运动，但暖空气相反往上升。”

        “太对了，这样，你就明白了冷空气比暖空气重，正如铸铁套比水要重是一个道理。现在，我们再回到主要问题，烟怎么会上升呢？”

        19．“天呀！我现在太清楚不过了，冷空气聚集下端，一旦用火加热，热空气很快上升，就像铸铁套中间的水，将水顶上去；暖空气裹住烟上升，好像旋风中盘旋而上的羽毛和尘埃。天呀！我终于知道了烟是如何上升的，这该多么奇怪呀！”



        20．“实在不愧是哲学家！”邦克高声叫道，“好了，事情已经完美解决，我真是服了你，你可真是千里挑一的好老师，自己思考不说，还教会他人思考；只要你乐意，你随时可以给自己封上这一光荣称号。”

THE ISLE OF LONG AGO


        很久以前的小岛

        Benjamin Franklin Taylor (b. 1819, d. 1887) was born at Lowville, N.Y. He graduated at Madison University, of which his father was president. In 1845 he published “Attractions of Language.” For many years he was literary editor of the “Chicago Journal.” Mr. Taylor wrote considerably for the magazines, was the author of many well-known favorite pieces both in prose and verse, and achieved success as a lecturer.





        1. Oh, a wonderful stream is the river of Time,

        As it runs through the realm[1] of tears,

        With a faultless rhythm[2] and a musical rhyme[3],

        And a boundless sweep and a surge[4] sublime,

        As it blends with the ocean of Years.





        2. How the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow,

        And the summers, like buds between;

        And the year in the sheaf—so they come and they go,

        On the river’s breast, with its ebb and flow,

        As it glides in the shadow and sheen.





        3. There’s a magical isle up the river of Time,

        Where the softest of airs are playing;

        There’s a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,

        And a song as sweet as a vesper[5] chime,

        And the Junes with the roses are staying.





        4. And the name of that isle is the Long Ago,

        And we bury our treasures there;

        There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow—

        There are heaps of dust—but we love them so!—

        There are trinkets and tresses of hair;





              5. There are fragments of song that nobody sings,

        And a part of an infant’s prayer,

        There’s a lute unswept, and a harp without strings;

        There are broken vows and pieces of rings,

        And the garments that she used to wear.





        6. There are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore

        By the mirage[6] is lifted in air;

        And we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar,

        Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before,

        When the wind down the river is fair.

        7. Oh, remembered for aye[7] be the blessed Isle,

        All the day of our life till night—

        When the evening comes with its beautiful smile,

        And our eyes are closing to slumber awhile,

        May that “Greenwood.” of Soul be in sight

        1．噢，一条神奇的时光之河，

        苦难深重，在泪水的眼眸流过，

        潺潺有声，拍响訇然震天旋律，

        不期撒落，时光的珠玑珍宝，

        韶华易逝，良辰美景奈何天？

        往事如烟，生死无常春不在，

        鬓发如霜，转眼青丝人已老。





        5．芬芳犹在，寂寞红尘无人吟唱，

        生命轮回，悄然为新生命祈祷，

        竖琴无弦，渺渺知音何处再觅？

        花飞花落，海誓山盟牵手走过。

        无言结局，真情几许为谁泪抛？



        6．寂寞海滩，白皙的手依然挥舞，

        仿佛听见，那声甜美穿越风暴，

        海市蜃楼，恍惚如梦风云际会，

        蓦然回头，幽魂倩影回眸难觅，

        沧桑阅尽，云淡风轻细水长绕。





        7．哦，难以忘怀，庄严神圣的小岛，

        春走到冬，生走到死，直到

        死神来临，带着那迷人微笑，

        歇息片刻，合上疲倦的双眼，

        青山绿水，揽你入永久怀抱。

THE BOSTON MASSACRE


        波士顿惨案

        George Bancroft (b. 1800, d. 1891) was born at Worcester, Mass. He was an ambitious student, and graduated at Harvard College before he was eighteen years of age. He then traveled in Europe, spending some time at the German universities. On his return, in 1822, he was appointed tutor in Greek at Harvard. His writings at this time were a small volume of original poems, some translations from Schiller and Goethe, and a few striking essays. Mr. Bancroft has held numerous high political offices. In 1838 he was appointed collector of the port at Boston; in 1845 he was made secretary of the Navy; in 1849 he was sent as United States Minister to Great Britain; and in 1867 he was sent in the same capacity to Prussia. The work which has given Mr. Bancroft his great literary reputation is his “History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent.” The first volume appeared in 1834. Philosophical in reasoning, interesting, terse in style, and founded on careful research, under the most favorable advantages, the work stands alone in its sphere.





        1. The evening of the fifth came on. The young moon was shining brightly in a cloudless winter sky, and its light was increased by a new-fallen snow. Parties of soldiers were driving about the streets, making a parade of valor, challenging resistance, and striking the inhabitants indiscriminately[8] with sticks or sheathed cutlasses.

        2. A band, which poured out from Murray’s barracks, in Brattle Street, armed with clubs, cutlasses, and bayonets, provoked resistance, and a fray ensued[9]. Ensign[10] Maul, at the gate of the barrack yard, cried to the soldiers: “Turn out, and I will stand by you; kill them; stick them; knock them down; run your bayonets through them.” One soldier after another leveled a firelock[11], and threatened to “make a lane” through the crowd.

        3. Just before nine, as an officer crossed King Street, now State Street, a barber’s lad cried after him: “There goes a mean fellow who hath not paid my father for dressing his hair;” on which, the sentinel stationed at the westerly end of the customhouse, on the corner of King Street and Exchange Lane, left his post, and with his musket gave the boy a stroke on the head, that made him stagger and cry for pain.

        4. The street soon became clear, and nobody troubled the sentry, when a party of soldiers issued violently from the main guard, their arms glittering in the moonlight, and passed on, hallooing: “Where are they? where are they? Let them come.”

        5. Presently twelve or fifteen more, uttering the same cries, rushed from the south into King Street, and so by the way of Cornhill towards Murray’s barracks. “Pray, soldiers, spare my life,” cried a boy of twelve, whom they met. “No, no, I’ll kill you all,” answered one of them, and knocked him down with his cutlass. They abused and insulted several persons at their doors and others in the street; “running about like madmen in a fury,” crying, “Fire!” which seemed their watchword, and, “Where are they? Knock them down.” Their outrageous behavior occasioned the ringing of the bell at the head of King Street.



              6. The citizens, whom the alarm set in motion, came out with canes and clubs; and, partly by the interference of well-disposed officers, partly by the courage of Crispus Attucks, a mulatto, and some others, the fray at the barracks was soon over. Of the citizens, the prudent shouted, “Home! home!” others, it is said, cried out, “Huzza for the main guard! there is the nest;” but the main guard was not molested the whole evening.

        7. A body of soldiers came up Royal Exchange Lane, crying, “Where are the cowards?” and, brandishing[12] their arms, passed through King Street. From ten to twenty boys came after them, asking, “Where are they? where are they?” “There is the soldier who knocked me down,” said the barber’s boy; and they began pushing one another towards the sentinel. He loaded and primed his musket. “The lobster is going to fire,” cried a boy. Waving his piece about, the sentinel pulled the trigger.

        8. “If you fire you must die for it,” said Henry Knox, who was passing by. “I don’t care,” replied the sentry, “if they touch me, I’ll fire.” “Fire!” shouted the boys, for they were persuaded he could not do it without leave from a civil officer; and a young fellow spoke out, “We will knock him down for snapping,” while they whistled through their fingers and huzzaed. “Stand off !” said the sentry, and shouted aloud, “Turn out, main guard!” “They are killing the sentinel,” reported a servant from the customhouse, running to the main guard. “Turn out! why don’t you turn cut?” cried Preston, who was captain of the day, to the guard.

        9. A party of six, two of whom, Kilroi and Montgomery, had been worsted at the ropewalk, formed, with a corporal in front and Preston following. With bayonets fixed, they “rushed through the people” upon the trot, cursing them, and pushing them as they went along. They found about ten persons round the sentry, while about fifty or sixty came down with them. “For God’s sake,” said Knox! holding Preston by the coat, “take your men back again; if they fire, your life must answer for the consequences.” “I know what I am about,” said he hastily, and much agitated.

        10. None pressed on them or provoked them till they began loading, when a party of about twelve in number, with sticks in their hands, moved from the middle of the street where they had been standing, gave three cheers, and passed along the front of the soldiers, whose muskets some of them struck as they went by. “You are cowardly rascals,” they said, “for bringing arms against naked men.” “Lay aside your guns, and we are ready for you.” “Are the soldiers loaded?” inquired Palmes of Preston. “Yes,” he answered, “with powder and ball.” “Are they going to fire upon the inhabitants?” asked Theodore Bliss. “They can not, without my orders,” replied Preston; while “the town-born” called out, “Come on, you rascals, you bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, fire, if you dare. We know you dare not.”

        11. Just then, Montgomery received a blow from a stick which had hit his Musket; and the word “fire!” being given by Preston, he stepped a little to one side, and shot Attucks, who at the time was quietly leaning on a long stick. “Don’t fire!” said Langford, the watchman, to Kilroi, looking him full in the face; but yet he did so, and Samuel Gray, who was standing next Langford, fell lifeless. The rest fired slowly and in succession on the people, who were dispersing. Three persons were killed, among them Attucks, the mulatto; eight were wounded, two of them mortally. Of all the eleven, not more than one had any share in the disturbance.



              12. So infuriated were the soldiers that, when the men returned to take up the dead, they prepared to fire again, but were checked by Preston, while the Twenty-ninth Regiment appeared under arms in King Street. “This is our time,” cried the soldiers of the Fourteenth; and dogs were never seen more greedy for their prey.

        13. The bells rung in all the churches; the town drums beat. “To arms! to arms!” was the cry. “Our hearts,” said Warren, “beat to arms, almost resolved by one stroke to avenge the death of our slaughtered brethren;” but they stood self-possessed[13], demanding justice according to the law. “Did you not know that you should not have fired without the order of a civil magistrate?” asked Hutchinson, on meeting Preston. “I did it,” answered Preston, “to save my men.”

        14. The people would not be pacified[14] or retire till the regiment was confined to the guardroom and the barracks; and Hutchinson himself gave assurances that instant inquiries should be made by the county magistrates. One hundred persons remained to keep watch on the examination, which lasted till three hours after midnight. A warrant[15] was issued against Preston, who surrendered himself to the sheriff; and the soldiers of his party were delivered up and committed to prison.

        乔治 · 班克罗夫特(1800～1891)出生于美国马萨诸塞州伍斯特，班克罗夫特学生时代时便具有远大志向，当年哈佛大学毕业时他尚不满18岁。毕业后，他随即赴欧洲旅行，并在德国高等院校考察一段时间。1822年回国后， 他被哈佛大学任命为希腊语导师。该段时间他推出一部篇幅不长的早年诗歌集以及席勒、歌德的一些翻译作品，还有数篇引起关注的散文。班克罗夫特先生身踞政治高位，任职颇多。1838年，他被任命为波士顿港口税收官；1845年，他被任命为海军部长；1849年，他作为美国外交大使被派往大不列颠；1867年，他以相同职位赴普鲁士上任。他的《美国历史——来自美洲大陆的发现》一书为他赢得极大文学声誉。1834年，该书第一卷出版。该书纵横捭阖，研究资料翔实可信，富有哲学推理，饶有趣味，风格洗练，历史视角极为优越，在世界同类作品中堪当独树一帜。





        1．第五个晚上降临了。冬夜，天上无云，月牙的明亮清辉撒落大地。天，刚下过雪，月光更为清冷亮丽。街上成群的英军士兵耀武扬威，波士顿居民怒火中烧集聚起来，抗议抵制英军，不少当地居民不由分说地拿起刀棍参与聚会。

        2．从布拉特大街穆雷兵营里跑出一群暴徒，他们全副武装地配备刺刀、棍棒还有弯刀，激怒了那些参与集聚的抵制者，双方随即发生了殴斗。此刻，在穆雷兵营门口，莫尔少尉正对那些士兵高声叫喊：“冲出去！我将和你们一起战斗；杀死这些暴徒，将他们打翻在地，用刺刀挑翻。”士兵们逐一校准毛瑟枪，群情激奋地疯狂叫嚣，将在人群中“杀出一条血路”。



              3．眼看快到九点，一位军官穿过国王大街，走到州立大街，一位理发店少年在他身后大声叫喊，“那个卑鄙的家伙走过来了，他理发没给我爸付钱。”听到少年的话，守卫在国王大街与皇家兑换巷拐角的海关处西端哨兵离开哨岗，用毛瑟枪猛击少年头部，少年踉跄几步，痛苦地叫唤起来。

        4．街道上很快变得空荡无人，没有人去骚扰那位哨兵。突然，一群士兵突然从驻防军总部方向冲过来，手中枪支在月光下发出凛冽寒光，他们一边跑，一边不停高叫，“那些暴徒在哪里？究竟在哪里？让他们站出来。”

        5．恰巧此时，十二或十五六个甚而更多的居民，从南边沿途哭喊着跑进国王大街，那是一条由康希尔路通往穆雷兵营的必经之路。士兵们迎头撞见一位十多岁孩子，“行行好，饶我一命，”那孩子苦苦哀求。“废话，把你们杀个片甲不留！”一位士兵恶狠狠地说，说罢，挥动短刀将那孩子刺翻在地。同时，他们肆意辱骂站在门口观望的几位居民，还有路边不多的行人，士兵们不停地高喊“开火！”看来这是当晚的行动暗号。他们“像一群狂怒的疯子，到处奔跑，”他们狂妄地叫嚣， “暴徒在哪里？将他们打翻在地。”士兵们所到之处的暴虐行为，打破了波士顿冬夜的宁静，国王大街上的钟声遽然响起。

        6．由于素日处事温和的当地市政官员介入，加上克里斯普斯•阿塔克斯与一些人士的鼓动，极为警觉的市民们纷纷拿着棍棒聚集街上，那位克里斯普斯为当地一位黑白混血居民。那时，发生在兵营里的骚乱很快结束，有些胆小的市民叫道，“回家吧！大家回家吧！”据说，现场也有些人高叫，“我们要去英军驻防军总部！那才是他们的老窝。”然而，整整一晚，驻防军总部相安无事。

        7．一群士兵抵达皇家兑换巷，他们不停叫着，“那些胆小鬼暴徒呢？”士兵们挥舞着手中武器，耀武扬威地走过国王大街。大约十到二十来位少年随后跑来。“那些士兵呢？他们去哪里了？”“就是这个哨兵把我打倒在地。”那位理发师的孩子说，一群少年蜂拥冲向站岗的哨兵，那家伙忙着装弹应付局面，“英国红虾兵要开枪了。”一个孩子尖叫，那位哨兵端枪晃动几下，打开了扳机。

        8．“只要开枪，你就必死无疑。”地方官亨利·诺克斯说，他当时刚巧路过。“我不在乎，”那哨兵回答，“如果他们胆敢碰我，我就开枪。”“开枪！开枪！”那群少年连声高叫，事先有人向他们透风，假若市政官员在场的话，英国哨兵就不敢开枪。突然，一位年轻人叫道，“把他揍倒，折断他的枪，”四下响起一片呼哨和连声哄叫。“往后退！”那英国兵高声叫唤。“快走，士兵们！”“暴徒们在袭击哨兵。”有人从海关处赶到驻防军总部禀告，“快走！火速赶去那里。”当天执勤的上尉普雷斯顿冲着士兵们吼叫。



              9．六人一行迅速赶到海关处，士兵基诺、蒙哥马利两人也其中，这些士兵与当地制绳厂工人一直交恶，冲突不断。一位下士疾走在前面，普雷斯顿上尉紧随其后。他们手端刺刀“冲进人群”，边跑边咒骂推搡聚集的人群。那时，他们看见大约十来人围着那位英国哨兵，还有五六十人随其身后围拢过来。“看在上帝的份上，”地方官诺克斯抓住普雷斯顿的衣领警告，“把你的人赶快再带回去，如果开火，你要用性命承担后果。”“我知道怎么做。”普雷斯顿忙不迭地辩白，显得极为焦躁不安。

        10．没有市民推搡或激怒这些士兵，直到他们开始装填子弹，人群中才爆发叫骂骚动。这时，一群十来人手里拿着木棍，突然从刚才站立的街中央冲将过来，他们高叫数声，从荷枪实弹的士兵面前跑过，有的人身体甚至抵到刺刀尖。“你们这些胆小鬼、恶棍！”他们纷纷对士兵指责叫骂，“你们竟敢用武器对付手无寸铁的市民。”“扔掉你们枪支，我们与你们拼一场。”“士兵们枪上好子弹吗？”地方官帕尔默斯问普雷斯顿。“上好了，”普雷斯顿回答，“火药铁砂已装好。”“士兵们会向市民开枪吗？”地方官西奥多·布利斯询问，“没有我的命令，不准开枪。”普雷斯顿上尉接着回答。在场的土著市民争相高叫，“来吧，开枪吧！你们这些卑鄙流氓，血腥屠杀者，英国红虾兵的无赖们，如果你们敢，就尽管开枪，我们知道你们不敢开枪！”

        11．恰好那时，有人用棍棒敲击蒙哥马利的毛瑟枪，然而却打到他的身上，普雷斯顿见势不好，稍微向旁边侧移让开，一声令下“开火”，一枪便击中了阿塔克斯，当时，阿塔克斯一声不吭地斜靠在一根长棍上。“不要开枪！”一位叫朗格•弗德的守夜人迎面冲着士兵基诺叫道，可基诺还是扣动了扳机，站在朗格•弗德身边的塞缪尔•格雷应声倒地，死了。随后，连续缓慢的枪声在人群中炸开，人们纷纷四下逃散，最终结果造成三人死亡，包括黑白混血儿的阿塔克斯；八人受伤，其中两人不治身亡。整个暴乱过程中，现场受伤或死亡的十一人中，仅有一人曾参与现场施暴。

        12．士兵们还是愤怒难抑，市民们返回欲想搬走尸体时候，他们再次准备开枪，但普雷斯顿此刻加以阻拦。这时，第二十九军团士兵全部武装地赶到国王大街。“这是我们的胜利时刻！”第十四军团士兵们高喊着，不曾见过，世上还有这类狗群如此贪婪地追逐猎物。



              13．所有教堂的钟声訇然响成一片，波士顿全镇鼓声齐鸣，到处响起“武装起来，武装起来”的呼喊。“第一道战鼓几乎刚刚响起，我们就决心拿起武器为被杀戮的兄弟报仇。”地方官员沃伦对公众说，市民们激愤情绪没有恶化，他们仍然保留理性克制，但强烈要求诉诸法律，给予刽子手以正义审判。“你们难道不知道，没有波士顿行政长官的命名，你们不能开火？”见到普雷斯顿，英军长官哈金森严厉质问自己部下。“责任全在我，”普雷斯顿回答，“请饶恕我的士兵吧。”



        14．英国军团将被限制于驻防地或军营不得外出，哈金森本人也做出承诺，波士顿地方官员即刻就该案件着手进行调查；涉案的一百来人将接受盘查，夜半后开始，三小时后结束。此刻，波士顿市民方才最后冷静下来，并表示退让。一份起诉普雷斯顿的允诺书亦已提交，普雷斯顿本人已向当地司法官认罪，同时交出他属下涉案的英国士兵，这些士兵随后被投入监狱。

DEATH OF THE BEAUTIFUL


        美丽的死亡

        Eliza Lee Fallen (b. 1787, d. 1859) was born in Boston, Mass. Her maiden name was Cabott. In 1828, she married Charles Follen, Professor of the German language and its literature in Harvard University. Her principal works are “Sketches of Married Life,” “The Skeptic,” “Twilight Stories,” and “Little Songs.” For several years Mrs. Follen was editor of the “Children’s Friend.”





        1. The young, the lovely, pass away,

        Ne’er to be seen again;

        Earth’s fairest flowers too soon decay,

        Its blasted trees remain.





        2. Full oft, we see the brightest thing

        That lifts its head on high,

        Smile in the light, then droop its wing,

        And fade away and die.





        3. And kindly is the lesson given;

        Then dry the falling tear:

        They came to raise our hearts to Heaven;

        They go to call us there.

        1. The wonderful snow is falling

        Over river and woodland and wold[1];

        The trees bear spectral[2] blossom

        In the moonshine blurr’d and cold.

        And these are the banished[3] flowers,

        Falling and driven and drifted

        Into this dark world of ours.

SQUEERS’S METHOD


        斯格威尔的手段

        Charles Dickens (b. 1812, d. 1870). This celebrated novelist was born in Portsmouth, England. He began his active life as a lawyer’s apprentice, in London; but soon became a reporter, and followed this occupation from 1831 to 1836. His first book was entitled “Sketches of London Society, by Boz.” In 1837 he published the “Pickwick Papers,” a work which established his reputation as a writer. His other works followed with great rapidity, and his last, “Edwin Drood,” was unfinished when he died. He visited America in 1842 and in 1867. He is buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens excelled in humor and pathos, and was particularly successful in delineating the joys and griefs of childhood. His writings have a tendency to prompt to deeds of kindness and benevolence. The following extract is taken from “Nicholas Nickleby,” one of the best of his novels.





        1. “Come,” said Squeers, “let’s go to the schoolroom; and lend me a hand with my school coat, will you?”

        Nicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian[1] shooting jacket, which he took down from a peg in the passage; and Squeers, arming himself with his cane, led the way across a yard to a door in the rear of the house.

        “There,” said the schoolmaster, as they stepped in together; “this is our shop, Nickleby.”

        2. It was such a crowded scene, and there were so many objects to attract attention, that at first Nicholas stared about him, really without seeing anything at all. By degrees, however, the place resolved[2] itself into a bare and dirty room with a couple of windows, whereof a tenth part might be of glass, the remainder being stopped up with old copy books and paper.

        3. There were a couple of long, old, rickety desks, cut and notched, and inked and damaged in every possible way; two or three forms, a detached desk for Squeers, and another for his assistant. The ceiling was supported like that of a barn, by crossbeams and rafters, and the walls were so stained and discolored that it was impossible to tell whether they had ever been touched by paint or whitewash.

        4. Pale and haggard faces, lank and bony figures, children with the countenances of old men, deformities[3] with irons upon their limbs, boys of stunted[4] growth, and others whose long, meager[5] legs would hardly bear their stooping bodies, all crowded on the view together. There were little faces which should have been handsome, darkened with the scowl of sullen, dogged suffering; there was childhood with the light of its eye quenched, its beauty gone, and its helplessness alone remaining.



              5. And yet this scene, painful as it was, had its grotesque[6] features, which, in a less interested observer than Nicholas, might have provoked a smile. Mrs. Squeers stood at one of the desks, presiding over an immense basin of brimstone and treacle, of which delicious compound she administered[7] a large installment[8] to each boy in succession, using for the purpose a common wooden spoon, which might have been originally manufactured for some gigantic top, and which widened every young gentleman’s mouth considerably, they being all obliged, under heavy corporeal[9] penalties, to take in the whole bowl at a gasp.

        6. “Now,” said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane, which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots, “is that physicking[10] over?”

        “Just over,” said Mrs. Squeers, choking the last boy in her hurry, and tapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him. “Here, you Smike: take away now. Look sharp!”

        7. Smike shuffled out with the basin, and Mrs. Squeers hurried out after him into a species of washhouse, where there was a small fire, and a large kettle, together with a number of little wooden bowls which were arranged upon a board. Into these bowls Mrs. Squeers, assisted by the hungry servant, poured a brown composition which looked like diluted[11] pincushions without the covers, and was called porridge. A minute wedge of brown bread was inserted in each bowl, and when they had eaten their porridge by means of the bread, the boys ate the bread itself, and had finished their breakfast, whereupon Mr. Squeers went away to his own.

        8. After some half-hour’s delay Mr. Squeers reappeared, and the boys took their places and their books, of which latter commodity[12] the average might be about one to eight learners. A few minutes having elapsed, during which Mr. Squeers looked very profound[13], as if he had a perfect apprehension[14] of what was inside all the books, and could say every word of their contents by heart, if he only chose to take the trouble, that gentleman called up the first class.

        9. Obedient to this summons there ranged themselves in front of the schoolmaster’s desk, half a dozen scarecrows, out at knees and elbows, one of whom placed a torn and filthy book beneath his learned eye.

        “This is the first class in English spelling and philosophy, Nickleby,” said Squeers, beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him. “We’ll get up a Latin one, and hand that over to you. Now, then, where’s the first boy?”

        10. “Please, sir, he’s cleaning the back parlor window,” said the temporary[15] head of the philosophical class.

        “So he is, to be sure,” rejoined Squeers. “We go upon the practical mode of teaching, Nickleby; the regular education system. C-l-e-a-n, clean, verb active, to make bright, to scour. W-i-n, win, d-e-r, der, winder, a casement. When the boy knows this out of book, he goes and does it. It’s just the same principle as the use of the globes. Where’s the second boy?”





              11. “Please, sir, he is weeding the garden,” replied a small voice.

        “To be sure,” said Squeers, by no means disconcerted[16], “so he is. B-o-t, bot, t-i-n, tin, n-e-y, ney, bottinney, noun substantive, a knowledge of plants. When he has learned that bottinney means a knowledge of plants, he goes and knows ’em. That’s our system, Nickleby: what do you think of it?”

        “It’s a very useful one, at any rate,” answered Nicholas, significantly[17].

        12. “I believe you,” rejoined Squeers, not remarking the emphasis of his usher. “Third boy, what’s a horse?”

        “A beast, sir,” replied the boy.

        “So it is,” said Squeers. “Ain’t it, Nickleby?”

        “I believe there is no doubt of that, sir,” answered Nicholas.

        “Of course there is n’t,” said Squeers. “A horse is a quadruped, and quadruped’s Latin for beast, as everybody that’s gone through the grammar knows, or else where’s the use of having grammars at all?”



              “Where, indeed!” said Nicholas, abstractedly[18].

        13. “As you’re perfect in that,” resumed Squeers, turning to the boy, “go and look after my horse, and rub him down well, or I’ll rub you down. The rest of the class go and draw water up till somebody tells you to leave off, for it’s washing day to-morrow, and they want the coppers filled.”

        查尔斯 ·狄更斯(1812～1870)，英国著名小说家，出生于英国普茨茅斯。狄更斯早年进入伦敦律师界做学徒，时间不长，1831～1836年期间，他转行任职记者。狄更斯首部作品为《博兹札记》；1837年，他出版《匹克威克外传》，奠定了作家的文坛地位。狄更斯创造颇丰，他的其他重要著作随后相继出版。《艾德威 · 德鲁德之谜》为作家死前未及封笔作品。1847年、1862年，狄更斯两次访问美国；去世后，他被安葬在英国威斯敏斯特教堂。





        1．“过来，”斯格威尔说，“我们去教室，帮我拿下我的校服。”

        尼古拉斯帮老爷穿上衣服，那件他刚从过道衣架上取下的老式绒衣飞行夹克。斯格威尔拿起手杖，带路穿过院子，来到屋后一座门前。

        “到地方了，”当他们一起走进屋内，这位校长开口说，“就在这里，尼克贝。”



        2．眼前景象相当凌乱，房间里到处堆满杂物，尼古拉斯眼神一时顾暇不及，起初，他紧紧地盯看周围，可压根没看清什么，渐渐地，眼前才变得清晰真切起来。房间里仅有两扇破窗，遍地肮脏，龌龊不堪，光线阴暗稀少，堆满破旧的抄写本和纸张。

        3．两张狭长颓旧的桌子摆在那里，看起来摇摇晃晃，桌上布满凹槽刻痕，桌面墨迹斑斑，难以想象的破损模样。单独摆放的那张是斯格威尔的桌子，另一张是他的助手的。教室房间的天花板由横椽和洐条支撑搭起，看起来与谷仓差不多；墙面满是污迹脏渍，颜色乌糟糟的色泽褪尽，实在看不出是否漆过或刷白。



        4．孩子们脸色苍白憔悴，带着老人般苍老神情，纤细羸弱的身材，脚上带着镣铐，瘦骨嶙峋甚而畸形变态；有些孩子矮小侏儒，有些孩子胫骨极细，几乎无法撑住佝偻摇晃的躯体。一眼望去，孩子们拥挤成团，无法看到本该健康正常的面孔。那满脸愁容的晦暗脸色，顽强挣命的生存痛苦，属于孩童眼眸里的光亮早已淬息，没有天真纯净开朗美丽，只有无以言说的悲哀无助。



              5．眼前痛苦扭曲的景象，却不乏荒诞无稽的悲戚，孩子们神情看起来比尼克贝还要漠然，但时而还能浮现不经意的惨笑。此刻，斯格威尔夫人站在桌边，正在掌管分发硫黄粉与糖浆，配好的甜味混合物装在一个硕大面盆里，孩子们排列成行，每人嘴里被强行灌进一大勺。斯格威尔夫人手上拿着一柄家常硕大木勺，或许当初特别出于剂量考虑，那把硕大木勺迫使男孩们竭力张大嘴巴，由于并非情愿，他们便逃不过残忍的肉体惩罚，喘息间，“啪”得入嘴一大坨。

        6．“喂，”斯格威尔用拐杖重重地敲击一下桌子，多半孩子刹那间三魂吓掉个两魂半，“治疗结束了吗？”

        “刚完。”斯格威尔夫人答道，她手脚慌忙地塞药，竟然让最后一个男孩噎住半晌，随后她猛地用木勺敲打孩子顶部，让他得以缓过气来，一边说，“好了，史迈克，赶快走，长点眼！”

        7．史迈克笨拙地端着盆走开了，斯格威尔夫人匆忙跟在他的身后，两人走进一间好像洗衣房的地方，房间炉灶上火苗很小，垛着个大水壶，旁边木板上摆放几只小木碗。在一位饥肠咕噜的佣人帮忙张罗下，斯格威尔夫人将一盆无盖、类似粥的褐色混合黏状物分别倒进木碗内，然后逐一添加小撮面包。孩子们就这样吃完面包，喝光粥，早餐转眼草草结束；之后，斯格威尔先生走开，独自享用他的早餐去了。

        8．约莫半个时辰，斯格威尔先生回来了，男孩们走到各自座位，拿出书本，大约八个孩子才能有一本书。不过几分钟光景，斯格威尔先生端出一副神色安详、知识渊博的模样。他似乎对书中所有内容领悟深透，对每一词语解释了然于胸，如果稍稍不厌其烦的话，这位先生恐怕会适时想起他的第一节课。

        9．孩子们乖顺听话地在这位校长桌前列成一排，六七个瘦骨嶙峋的稻草人孩子，膝盖手肘并用地挪将过来，其中一个孩子将一本毁损的、污秽不堪的书放在校长充满睿智的眼皮下。

        “尼克贝，这是我们第一节英语拼写和语法课。”斯格威尔先生开口说，示意尼古拉斯•尼克贝过来站在他的身边。“今天，我们将学习一个拉丁词，我会把这个拉丁词语教给你们。好了，班长今天在哪？”

        10．“先生，他正在擦洗后面客厅的窗户。”语法课临时班长报告说。

        “哦，这么回事，”斯格威尔先生继续说，“尼克贝，今天我们将采用实用的教学模式，即常规的教育体系。C-l-e-a-n，clean，一个主动动词，意思是变得明亮，清洗东西。W-i-n，win， d-e-r， der，winder，卷绕，卷起一扇铰链窗。你们在书本外学习这个单词，然后走过去卷起窗子，这种学习方法正是世界普遍采用的法则。副班长在哪？”



              11．“先生，他在花园里拔草。”一个声音低声回答。

        “怎么回事。”斯格威尔说道，声音坦然，没有丝毫困窘不安。“哦，他在拔草， B-o-t， bot， t-i-n， tin， n-e-y，ney， bottinney，名词性质，植物学知识。学生们学习植物学，这词表示植物类知识，学生学习后了解植物，这就是我们的学习体系，尼克贝，你觉得呢？”

        “无论如何，这门功课非常有用。”尼古拉斯意味深长地回答。

        12．“我相信你。”斯格威尔接着说，并未觉察到尼克贝的弦外之音。“第三个回答的孩子，马是什么？”

        “一种动物，先生。”那男孩答道。

        “正是。”斯格威尔说。“莫非马不是动物？尼克贝？”

        “毫无疑问，马是动物，先生。”尼克贝答道。“当然，这里没有马，”斯格威尔说，“马是一种四脚兽，四脚兽的拉丁语就是兽类，这一点，每个学过语法的学生都知道，不然的话，学些语法还有什么用呢？”

        “这究竟哪对哪，真是！”尼古拉斯心不在焉地小声嘀咕。

        13．“既然你们表现都还不错，”斯格威尔接着转向对那个男生说，“现在就去照看我的马匹，好好将它全身擦洗干净，否则，仔细我修理你。其他的学生去提水，没有吩咐不得停下休息，明天是清洗日，所有大缸小盆都要统统装满。”

THE GIFT OF EMPTY HANDS


        两手空空的礼物

        Mrs. S. M. B. Piatt (b, 1835,—) was born near Lexington, Ky. While still a young girl she began to write poetry, which was well received. In 1861 she was married to the poet John James Piatt. Mrs. Piatt’s poetry is marked by tender pathos, thoughtfulness, and musical flow of rhythm. The following selection is from “That New World.”





        1. They were two princes doomed[19] to death;

        Each loved his beauty and his breath:

        “Leave us our life and we will bring

        Fair gifts unto our lord, the king.”





        2. They went together. In the dew

        A charmed[20] bird before them flew.

        Through sun and thorn one followed it;

        Upon the other’s arm it lit.





        3. A rose, whose faintest flush was worth

        All buds that ever blew[21] on earth,

        One climbed the rocks to reach; ah, well,

        Into the other’s breast it fell.





        4. Weird[22] jewels, such as fairies wear,

        When moons go out, to light their hair,

        One tried to touch on ghostly ground;

        Gems of quick[23] fire the other found.





        5. One with the dragon fought to gain

        The enchanted fruit, and fought in vain;

        The other breathed the garden’s air

        And gathered precious apples there.





              6. Backward to the imperial[24] gate

        One took his fortune, one his fate:

        One showed sweet gifts from sweetest lands,

        The other, torn and empty hands.





        7. At bird, and rose, and gem, and fruit,

        The king was sad, the king was mute[25];

        At last he slowly said: “My son,

        True treasure is not lightly won.





        8. Your brother’s hands, wherein you see

        Only these scars, show more to me

        Than if a kingdom’s price I found

        In place of each forgotten wound.”

        国王悲恸不止，缄默无言，

        最后缓缓开口，“儿子们，

        真正宝物，并非轻易得到。





        8．“你哥哥的手， 当然你也看见，

        唯独那疤痕， 意义不同寻常，

        良心才发现， 难道王位价值，

        就能忘记或替代， 所有心灵伤口？”





        LESSON 80





CAPTURING THE WILD HORSE


        捕捉野马

        1. We left the buffalo camp about eight o’clock, and had a toilsome and harassing march of two hours, over ridges of hills covered with a ragged forest of scrub oaks, and broken by deep gullies[26].

        2. About ten o’clock in the morning we came to where this line of rugged hills swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north fork of Red River. A beautiful meadow, about half a mile wide, enameled with yellow, autumnal flowers, stretched for two or three miles along the foot of the hills, bordered on the opposite side by the river, whose banks were fringed with cottonwood trees, the bright foliage of which refreshed and delighted the eye, after being wearied by the contemplation of monotonous wastes of brown forest.

        3. The meadow was finely diversified[27] by groves and clumps of trees, so happily dispersed that they seemed as if set out by the hand of art. As we cast our eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we beheld a troop of wild horses quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a mile distant, to our right, while to our left, at nearly the same distance, were several buffaloes; some feeding, others reposing, and ruminating[28] among the high, rich herbage[29], under the shade of a clump of cottonwood trees. The whole had the appearance of a broad, beautiful tract of pasture land, on the highly ornamented estate of some gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing about the lawns and meadows.

        4. A council of war was now held, and it was determined to profit by the present favorable opportunity, and try our hand at the grand hunting maneuver which is called “ringing the wild horse.” This requires a large party of horsemen, well mounted. They extend themselves in each direction, at a certain distance apart, and gradually form a ring of two or three miles in circumference, so as to surround the game. This must be done with extreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily alarmed inhabitant of the prairie[30], and can scent a hunter a great distance, if to windward[31].

        5. The ring being formed, two or three ride toward the horses, which start off in an opposite direction. Whenever they approach the bounds of the ring, however, a huntsman presents himself, and turns them from their course. In this way they are checked, and driven back at every point, and kept galloping round and round this magic circle, until, being completely tired down, it is easy for hunters to ride up beside them and throw the lariat[32] over their heads. The prime horses of the most speed, courage, and bottom[33], however, are apt to break through and escape, so that, in general, it is the second-rate horses that are taken.



              6. Preparations were now made for a hunt of this kind. The pack horses were now taken into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest in a rush of the wild horses they should break away. Twenty-five men were then sent under the command of a lieutenant to steal along the edge of the valley within the strip of wood that skirted the hills. They were to station themselves about fifty yards apart, within the edge of the woods, and not advance or show themselves until the horses dashed in that direction. Twenty-five men were sent across the valley to steal in like manner along the river bank that bordered the opposite side, and to station themselves among the trees.



        7. A third party of about the same number was to form a line, stretching across the lower part of the valley, so as to connect the two wings. Beatte and our other half-breed, Antoine, together with the ever-officious Tonish, were to make a circuit through the woods so as to get to the upper part of the valley, in the rear of the horses, and drive them forward into the kind of sack that we had formed, while the two wings should join behind them and make a complete circle.

        8. The flanking[34] parties were quietly extending themselves out of sight, on each side of the valley, and the residue were stretching themselves like the links of a chain across it, when the wild horses gave signs that they scented an enemy; snuffing the air, snorting, and looking about. At length they pranced off slowly toward the river, and disappeared behind a green bank.

        9. Here, had the regulations of the chase been observed, they would have been quietly checked and turned back by the advance of a hunter from among the trees. Unluckily, however, we had our wildfire, Jack-o’-lantern [35]little Frenchman to deal with. Instead of keeping quietly up the right side of the valley, to get above the horses, the moment he saw them move toward the river he broke out of the covert[36] of woods and dashed furiously across the plain in pursuit of them. This put an end to all system. The half-breeds, and half a score of rangers, joined in the chase.

        10. A way they all went over the green bank. In a moment or two the wild horses reappeared, and came thundering down the valley, with Frenchman, half-breeds, and rangers galloping and bellowing behind them. It was in vain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to check and turn back the fugitives; they were too hotly pressed by their pursuers: in their panic[37] they dashed through the line, and clattered down the plain.

        11. The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some of the rangers without hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears, and others with handkerchiefs tied round their heads. The buffaloes, which had been calmly ruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed for a moment at the tempest that came scouring down the meadow, then turned and took to heavy, rolling flight. They were soon overtaken; the promiscuous[38] throng were pressed together by the contracting sides of the valley, and away they went, pellmell, hurry-skurry, wild buffalo, wild horse, wild huntsman, with clang and clatter, and whoop and halloo, that made the forests ring.



              12. At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake, on the river bank, while the horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with their pursuers close to their heels. Beatte passed several of them, having fixed his eye upon a fine Pawnee horse that had his ears slit and saddle marks upon his back. He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in the woods.

        13. Among the wild horses was a fine black mare, which in scrambling up the defile tripped and fell. A young ranger sprang from his horse and seized her by the mane and muzzle. Another ranger dismounted and came to his assistance. The mare struggled fiercely, kicking and biting, and striking with her fore feet, but a noose was slipped over her head, and her struggles were in vain.

        14. It was some time, however, before she gave over rearing and plunging, and lashing out with her feet on every side. The two rangers then led her along the valley, by two strong lariats, which enabled them to keep at a sufficient distance on each side to be out of the reach of her hoofs, and whenever she struck out in one direction she was jerked in the other. In this way her spirit was gradually subdued.

        15. As to Tonish, who had marred[39] the whole scene by his precipitancy, he had been more successful than he deserved, having managed to catch a beautiful cream-colored colt about seven months old, that had not strength to keep up with its companions. The mercurial[40] little Frenchman was beside himself with exultation. It was amusing to see him with his prize. The colt would rear and kick, and struggle to get free, when Tonish would take him about the neck, wrestle with him, jump on his back, and cut as many antics as a monkey with a kitten.

        16. Nothing surprised me more, however, than to witness how soon these poor animals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the prairie, yielded to the dominion of man. In the course of two or three days the mare and colt went with the led horses and became quite docile.

        —Washington Irving

        1．我们八点钟左右离开布法罗营地，艰难辛苦地跋涉两个小时，穿越道道山脊，路上到处是参差不齐的矮橡树林，不时可见幽深僻静的溪谷沟壑。

        2．早上大约十点的时候，我们来到高矮不一的一处丛林路口，俯瞰脚下林木直抵山下沟谷，那条红河北段从脚下沟底流过。一处大约半英里宽、美丽的草原甸子缀满秋天金黄灿烂的花朵，那片草原甸子沿山脚一直伸展两三英里，抵达河对岸一侧。河两岸长着三角叶杨树，脚底踩着深浅不一的沉积物，在满眼褐色森林里穿梭良久，眼睛趋于长时间麻木倦殆，倏然看到这片浓艳树叶，眼前顿时一亮。

        3．草原甸子恰好层次分明，一边是灌木林，一边是排列整齐的树木，似乎由一双艺术大手精巧分开。当我们将目光转向这片清新宜人的山谷，只看见一群野马在黢绿的草地上安静地吃草。野马群位于我们右侧大约一英里开外，而我们左侧，几乎差不多远的地方，一片三角叶杨树丛林的浓荫下，草地上牧草很高，长势茂盛，几只野牛正在草甸盘桓，有的在啃噬青草，有的在歇息反刍。牧场景色美丽寥廓，和谐安谧，宛如不失绅士优雅风度的农夫，从容悠闲地放牧他的牛群，好一派浓郁迷人的田园风光。



              4．就如何捕捉这群野马，我们召开了战前会，抓住目前有利机遇乃是上策，采取最为有效的捕猎计谋，即通常所说的“打围野马”。这一计划不仅需要相当多的骑手，且需骑手技艺超群，还须拥有不同角度条件下驾驭控制马的过人能力，甚至离马相当距离也能游刃有余地掌控身体的超凡骑术。这样，才能从两三英里外形成包围圈围住马群。这种打围需要极度谨慎小心，因为野马对草原原住民最为警觉，如果顺风，很远都能嗅到猎人的气味。

        5．包围圈一旦形成，两三个骑手就冲向马群，最初冲击方向往往与最后打围方向相反，直到骑手抵达包围圈边界，猎人才最终出现。这种方式逼迫马群偏转原来路线，马群在每一设伏点皆受到拦阻驱逐，因此它们就会围绕骑手布下的神奇围圈不停地飞奔疾驰，直到彻底精疲力竭。这时，猎人们才飞奔上马，疾驰飞奔中扔出套索，紧紧地套牢马匹。那些一流的马极擅奔跑，具有超凡勇气耐力，亦最有可能冲出包围圈逃之夭夭，因此，一般来说，人们捕获的多为品质稍劣的马匹。

        6．现在开始为围猎做前期准备。一群马被牵进树林，紧紧地系在树上，以免等会野马冲过来，它们可能挣脱逃走。在中尉率领下，一支二十五人的队伍悄悄沿着山谷边缘进发，山谷毗邻山脚下环山的条形状树林。那二十五人大约以五十码间隔距离布好位置，藏身在树林边缘，等到野马群朝他们这边飞奔过来，他们才冒头拦阻。另有二十五人穿越山谷，在其相应地段对面，沿河岸布阵，亦藏身树林中间。

        7．另外再派出大体数目相当的人排成一列，沿山谷低段延伸站开，以此连接两翼包围圈。比特还有另外一个混血儿骑手安东尼，再加上总爱管闲事的托尼斯，他们三人将穿越树林，到达山谷稍高地带，出现在野马群后面，驱赶马群向前进入我们已设伏好的布袋，而其他两翼亦应与其呼应连接，形成一个完整的包围圈。

        8．同时，侧翼人马也在悄无声息地散开，消失在远方，他们将在山谷四边设好埋伏圈。最后剩下的人，将补充填实整条包围圈可能出现的缺口。就在这时，野马群发出信号，它们发现了危险临近，马群不停地嗅嗅四周，打出喷嚏，然后环顾左右，最后三三两两地缓慢地朝那条河走去，消失在那条河绿色堤岸后。



              9．哎呀，假如严格遵守围猎规则，野马群很可能被树林里冒出的猎手拦阻，然后安静地后撤，然而，不幸的是，鬼使神差中，那位身材矮小的法国佬让整个打围过程变得诡异无常。他们一行设伏在山谷右面，未能保持按兵不动，从而掌控野马群走向；那家伙一看见马群朝河流那边移动，竟然从树林里冲出来，发狂地穿过草原追撵马群，从而使整个计划彻底乱套。这时，一些混血儿骑手，加上其他十多位游牧骑手，亦争先恐后地参与疯狂追赶。

        10．那些骑手们飞驰越过绿色堤岸，不一会儿，野马群再度进入视线，山谷下一片喊声震天。那位矮小的法国人，那些混血儿打围者，还有那些游牧骑手们策马飞奔，吼叫声、呐喊声在马群身后响成一片。此刻，那道穿越山谷准备围堵拦截野马群的防线完全失去作用。马群遭遇追赶者的猛烈追逐，它们在恐慌中狂奔，冲破了那道防线，草原上嘈杂喊叫震地连天。

        11．所有的人无不裹进这种轻率冒失的追逐，有的骑手没戴帽子，长风肆意凌乱着他们头发，还有些猎手用布条将脑后头发扎紧。一直安静吃草的野牛群觉察到不安，收拢起庞大队形，屏神凝气地聆听草地那边传来的骚动，片刻工夫掉头，尥起蹄子成群跑开。杂乱蜂拥的野牛群一泄如注，山谷那边围猎嘈杂更加剧了牛群恐惧，它们拥挤不堪，忙不择路地夺命狂奔。那些野牛野马，加上游牧骑手搅成乱团，牛群马群的骚乱炸锅，骑手鞍具的哗啦作响，各路人马声嘶力竭的呼喊嘶叫，使整个打围场面愈发喧嚣壮观。

        12．野牛群一直跑到河岸绿草地，总算收住了蹄子，而此刻野马群正从山谷一处狭窄隘口发狂地夺路奔下，后面骑手们紧追不舍，他们离马群愈来愈近。比特疾驰越过好几匹野马，眼睛死死盯着一匹漂亮的北美印第安族波尼马，那马明显特征的狭长鞍形耳朵贴在脖颈后面。比特勇敢地揿着马，然而，在穿越丛林的迅速奔跑中，那马转瞬间便不知去向。

        13．野马群中还有匹漂亮的黑色母马，那马趔趄着爬上隘道，却不幸绊倒在地，一位年轻骑手从马上猛地飞扑上去，抓住了它的鬃毛和牙口。另一位骑手也旋即下马，助他一臂之力。那母马狂暴地挣脱，前后尥蹄，连踢带咬，可一条套索套上它的头颈，顷刻之间，它的拼命挣扎完全失去意义。

        14．然而，好大一会儿工夫，那母马狂乱地尥蹄乱跳，前蹄后蹄死命猛踢，两位骑手用两条结实的绳索死死拽住马，沿着河谷兜转，绳索很长，骑手与马匹才能保持相当距离，确保不会被马踢到。无论马朝哪边拼命挣脱，另一边绳索亦会紧紧拴着它动弹不得。最后，那马终于被驯服地安静下来。

        15．那位由于鲁莽草率而打乱整个围猎计划的托尼斯，此行收获不小，他捕获了一匹大约七个月大小的奶油色马驹，那弱小马驹实在无力跟上马群。那位活泼机智、矮小的法国佬大喜过望地站在托尼斯身边，看着托尼斯收获，开怀放肆地大笑起来。小马驹后尥前踢，挣扎着想逃走，突然，托尼斯一把抓住它的脖子，朝它打个响亮呼哨，一个鹞子翻身跃到它的背上，像猴子耍逗小猫般尽情作乐，扮出一连串滑稽不堪的怪脸。



              16．没有任何事情能比这更让人激动不已，看着这些可怜的野马，如此迅捷地被人们从它们无拘无束、自由生活的大草原上掳走，从此，它们不得不屈从人的意志。两三天内，那匹母马和小马驹将被牵到备用马群中，很快将接受人为残酷的驯服。

SOWING AND REAPING


        播种与收获

        Adelaide Anne Procter (b. 1825, d. 1864) was the daughter of Bryan Waller Procter (better known as “Barry Cornwall ”), a celebrated English poet, living in London. Miss Procter’s first volume, “Legends and Lyrics,” appeared in 1858, and met with great success; it was republished in this country. A second series, under the same name, was published in 1860; and in 1862 both series were republished with additional poems, and an introduction by Charles Dickens. In 1861 Miss Procter edited “Victoria Regia,” a collection of poetical pieces, to which she contributed; and in 1862 “A Chaplet of Verses,” composed of her own poems, was published. Besides these volumes, she contributed largely to various magazines and periodicals.





        1. Sow with a generous hand;

        Pause not for toil and pain;

        Weary not through the heat of summer,

        Weary not through the cold spring rain;

        But wait till the autumn comes

        For the sheaves of golden grain.





        2. Scatter the seed, and fear not,

        A table will be spread;

        What matter if you are too weary

        To eat your hard-earned bread;

        Sow, while the earth is broken,

        For the hungry must be fed.

        3. Sow;—while the seeds are lying

        In the warm earth’s bosom deep,

        And your warm tears fall upon it—

        They will stir in their quiet sleep,

        And the green blades rise the quicker,

        Perchance, for the tears you weep.

        4. Then sow;—for the hours are fleeting,

        And the seed must fall to-day;

        And care not what hand shall reap it,

        Or if you shall have passed away

        Before the waving cornfields

        Shall gladden the sunny day.





        5. Sow;—and look onward, upward,

        Where the starry light appears,—

        Where, in spite of the coward’s doubting,

        Or your own heart’s trembling fears,

        You shall reap in joy the harvest

        You have sown to-day in tears.

        毫不计较，夏天炙热，

        早春淫雨，侵人肌骨。

        金秋时刻，终于来临，

        丰收庄稼，漫山遍谷。





        2．播撒种子，恐惧不再，

        一畦春苗，即将发芽，

        汗滴禾下，盘中之餐，

        悲喜欣集，拜赐双手，

        精耕细作，播种希望，

        凡尘百姓，食大为天。





        3．金色种子，播进泥土，

        静静躺在，母亲怀里，

        滚烫泪水，扑簌落下，

        惊蛰声中，睡眠结束，



              绿色芽苗，破土而出，

        争相报答，农夫辛苦。





        4．春光易逝，不误农时，

        披星戴月，犁田耙土。

        前人栽树，后人乘凉，

        赠人玫瑰 手有余香。

        麦浪翻滚，收获稻谷，

        耕者慷慨，造福桑梓。





        5．不停播种，仰望前行，

        繁星万点，摇曳出现，

        凄风冷雨，难以畏惧，

        丰满自足，持奉信念。

        收获幸福，在丰收里，

        播撒种子，在眼泪里。





        LESSON 82





TAKING COMFORT


        自我解脱

        1. For the last few days, the fine weather has led me away from books and papers, and the close air of dwellings, into the open fields, and under the soft, warm sunshine, and the softer light of a full moon. The loveliest season of the whole year—that transient[41] but delightful interval between the storms of the “wild equinox[42], with all their wet,” and the dark, short, dismal days which precede the rigor[43] of winter—is now with us. The sun rises through a soft and hazy atmosphere; the light mist clouds melt gradually before him; and his noontide light rests warm and clear on still woods, tranquil waters, and grasses green with the late autumnal rains.

        2. One fine morning, not long ago, I strolled down the Merrimac, on the Tewksbury shore. I know of no walk in the vicinity of Lowell so inviting as that along the margin of the river, for nearly a mile from the village of Belvidere. The path winds, green and flower-skirted, among beeches and oaks, through whose boughs you catch glimpses of waters sparkling and dashing below. Rocks, huge and picturesque[44], jut out into the stream, affording beautiful views of the river and the distant city.

        3. Half fatigued with my walk, I threw myself down upon a rocky slope of the bank, where the panorama[45] of earth, sky, and water lay clear and distinct about me. Far above, silent and dim as a picture, was the city, with its huge mill masonry, confused chimney tops, and church spires; near it rose the height of Belvidere, with its deserted burial place and neglected gravestones sharply defined on its bleak, bare summit against the sky; before me the river went dashing down its rugged channel, sending up its everlasting murmur; above me the birch tree hung its tassels; and the last wild flowers of autumn profusely fringed the rocky rim of the water.

        4. Right opposite, the Dracut woods stretched upwards from the shore, beautiful with the hues of frost, glowing with tints richer and deeper than those which Claude or Poussin mingled, as if the rainbows of a summer shower had fallen among them. At a little distance to the right, a group of cattle stood mid-leg deep in the river; and a troop of children, bright-eyed and mirthful, were casting pebbles at them from a projecting shelf of rock. Over all a warm but softened sunshine melted down from a slumberous autumnal sky.

        5. My reverie[46] was disagreeably broken. A low, grunting sound, half bestial[47], half human, attracted my attention. I was not alone. Close beside me, half hidden by a tuft of bushes, lay a human being, stretched out at full length, with his face literally[48] rooted into the gravel. A little boy, five or six years of age, clean and healthful, with his fair brown locks and blue eyes, stood on the bank above, gazing down upon him with an expression of childhood’s simple and unaffected pity.



              6. “What ails you?” asked the boy at length. “What makes you lie there?”

        The prostrate[49] groveler[50] struggled halfway up, exhibiting the bloated[51] and filthy countenance of a drunkard. He made two or three efforts to get upon his feet, lost his balance, and tumbled forward upon his face.

        “What are you doing there?” inquired the boy.

        “I’m taking comfort,” he muttered, with his mouth in the dirt.

        7. Taking his comfort! There he lay,—squalid and loathsome under the bright heaven,—an imbruted[52] man. The holy harmonies[53] of Nature, the sounds of gushing waters, the rustle of the leaves above him, the wild flowers, the frost bloom of the woods,—what were they to him? Insensible, deaf, and blind, in the stupor of a living death, he lay there, literally realizing[54] that most bitterly significant eastern malediction[55], “May you eat dirt.”

        (Whittier)




【中文阅读】

        1．最近这两天，天气真好，我放下书本，离开沉闷压抑的家，走到户外，走进温暖柔和的阳光下，走到清新满月的月光里，正值一年中最佳季节。阴雨连绵，狂暴的秋分刚刚过去，寒冷凄凉的冬天即将到来，很快阳光稀少，晦暗难捱；此刻，我们却拥有一个短暂快乐的艳阳天。秋阳在薄霭笼罩的大地升起，光线朦胧柔和，袅袅云烟渐次散去。正午明晃晃太阳落在寂静的树林，恬美静默的水面，还有暖暖的绿色草地，清澈阳光下居然夹杂些许晚秋落雨。

        2．不久以前，一个美妙的清晨，我来到图克斯伯里河岸，沿梅里马克河顺流而下悠闲散步。我不曾知道洛维尔周边风景如此美丽，沿河两岸景色娴静迷人，梅里马克河离贝尔维迪尔村庄差不多有一英里，小路蜿蜒延伸，两边缀有草地鲜花。我信步穿过山毛榉树林以及橡树林，一路临岸依立的枝干粗硕，水面波光粼粼，水流湍急。嶙峋怪石立在水中，眼前河流与远处城镇融为一体，风景如画。



              3．半路走倦了，我索性在河岸一处巉岩的陡坡上坐下，周边景色开阔寥落，风光浩荡一揽尽收，只见天高地阔，河水清澈，极目望去，远处城镇安静得有点朦胧，宛如一幅画，影影绰绰，分不清究竟是庞大的磨坊砖墙还是烟囱顶端；高高的教堂尖塔，紧挨旁边是贝尔维迪尔高地，在天空衬托下，裸露阴晦的山顶上，那片荒凉墓地夹杂棱角分明的散落碑石格外触目；眼前河道崎岖，河水湍急，仿佛吟唱一曲经久不息的歌谣；我头顶上方的桦木枝繁叶茂，河边崖壁上嵌满了秋季最后盛开的荼靡。

        4．恰好河岸对面，德雷卡特森林从岸边一直往上游延伸，阳光辉映下，露珠闪耀晶莹，招摇炫目极了，变幻出魔幻繁杂的色彩，比克劳德森林或普辛森林漂亮多了，简直就像夏季暴雨后一道漫天瑰丽的彩虹。右边不远的地方，一群牛站在没膝的河水中，岸边，一块片状巨石兀立而起；一群开心的孩子们，正朝那群牛儿甩石子，他们眼里洋溢着无拘无束的快乐欢情。温暖秋阳柔软地抚摩万物，天空下满是浓郁的慵懒。

        5．一阵低沉的咕哝声打断了我的沉思冥想，让我略感不快，我居然看到一位半兽半人的家伙，心里并不觉得害怕。就在我身边，一簇灌丛边躺着一个人，他的四肢摊开，脸部简直就是埋在砾石里，似乎那是个孩子，不过五六岁大小，看起来还很健康，衣着干净，褐色的美丽头发，蓝色的眼睛。我站在上端堤岸上，向下打量着他，眼里满是孩子般的真诚怜悯。

        6．“你哪里不舒服？”我开口问道，“你怎么躺着那里？”那匍匐在地的家伙挣扎爬起，一付醉醺醺酒鬼的污秽嘴脸，他拼命地两三次欲想站起，没想到却失去重心，脸部朝下再次摔倒。

        “你到这里做什么？”我问他。

         “我在自我解脱。”他咕哝着说，嘴角紧贴泥土。

        7．自我解脱！他躺在那里，浑身污秽不堪。令人憎恶，一如行尸走肉，趴在一望如洗的蓝天下？自然神性和谐，河水滚滚不息，枝头树叶婆娑，漫地灿烂野花，树林里闪动晶莹的晨霜，所有这些美好对他意味着什么？毫无知觉，失去听觉，没有视觉，纯粹一个活死人的恍惚虚无世界。他僵卧在那里，恐怕最能验证那句颇为苦涩的东方咒语：“啃你的土去吧。”

        LESSON 83





CALLING THE ROLL


        点 名

        1. “CORPORAL GREEN!” the orderly cried;

        “Here!” was the answer, loud and clear,

        From the lips of a soldier standing near;

        And “here!” was the word the next replied.

        “Cyrus Drew!” and a silence fell;

        This time no answer followed the call;

        Only his rear man saw him fall,

        Killed or wounded he could not tell.





        2. There they stood in the fading light,

        These men of battle, with grave, dark looks,

        As plain to be read as open books,

        While slowly gathered the shades of night.

        The fern on the slope was splashed with blood,

        And down in the corn, where the poppies grew,

        Were redder stains than the poppies knew;

        And crimson-dyed was the river’s flood.





        3. For the foe had crossed from the other side

        That day, in the face of a murderous fire

        That swept them down in its terrible ire;

        And their lifeblood went to color the tide.

        “Herbert Cline!” At the call there came

        Two stalwart soldiers into the line,

        Bearing between them Herbert Cline,

        Wounded and bleeding, to answer his name.





        4. “Ezra Kerr!” and a voice said “here!”

        “Hiram Kerr!” but no man replied:

        They were brothers, these two; the sad wind sighed,

        And a shudder crept through the cornfield near.

        “Ephraim Deane!”—then a soldier spoke:

        “Deane carried our regiment’s colors,” he said,

        “When our ensign was shot; I left him dead,

        Just after the enemy wavered and broke.





              5. “Close to the roadside his body lies;

        I paused a moment and gave him to drink;

        He murmured his mother’s name, I think;

        And death came with it and closed his eyes.”

        ’T was a victory—yes; but it cost us dear;

        For that company’s roll, when called at night,

        Of a hundred men who went into the fight,

        Numbered but twenty that answered “here!”

        (Shepherd)

        人群中，无人应答。

        他身后士兵，见他最后倒下，

        但无法知道，他死去或受伤。





        2．士兵们站在， 昏黄灯火下，

        一群赴死的人， 面容阴沉晦暗，

        生死不足惜， 犹如必须打开的书，

        “以法莲 · 迪恩！”有位士兵报告，

        “迪恩，不愧我们军团骄傲！

        那时，敌人已经后退溃败，

        他扛着军旗冲锋，中弹倒下。





        5．“他躺在路边， 快要死了，

        我停下脚步， 喂他点水，

        他嘴唇嗫嚅， 或许唤着妈妈，

        点名队列中，永远不会出现。

        生死离别，勇士出征几人回？

        天亦无情，残阳西下慈母泪。

        LESSON 84





TURTLE SOUP


        龟煲汤

        Charles Frederick Briggs (b. 1804, d. 1877) was born on the island of Nantucket. When quite young, however, he became a resident of New York City. In 1845, in conjunction with Edgar A. Poe, he began the publication of the “Broadway Journal;” he was also connected with the “New York Times,” and the “Evening Mirror;” also as editor from 1853 to 1856 with “Putnam’s Magazine.” Mr. Briggs wrote a few novels, some poetry, and numerous little humorous tales and sketches. The following selection is from “Working a Passage; or, Life on a Liner,” one of his best stories.





        1. Among the luxuries which the captain had provided for himself and passengers was a fine green turtle, which was not likely to suffer from exposure to salt water, so it was reserved[56] until all the pigs, and sheep, and poultry had been eaten. A few days before we arrived, it was determined to kill the turtle and have a feast the next day.

        2. Our cabin gentlemen had been long enough deprived of fresh meats to make them cast lickerish[57] glances towards their hard-skinned friend, and there was a great smacking of lips the day before he was killed. As I walked aft[58] occasionally, I heard them congratulating themselves on their prospective[59] turtle soup and forcemeat[60] balls; and one of them, to heighten the luxury of the feast, ate nothing but a dry biscuit for the twenty-four hours preceding, that he might be prepared to devour his full share of the unctuous[61] compound.

        3. It was to be a gala day with them; and though it was not champagne day, that falling on Saturday and this on Friday, they agreed to have champagne a day in advance, that nothing should be wanting to give a finish to their turtle. It happened to be a rougher day than usual when the turtle was cooked, but they had become too well used to the motion of the ship to mind that.

        4. It happened to be my turn at the wheel the hour before dinner, and I had the tantalizing misery of hearing them laughing and talking about their turtle, while I was hungry from want of dry bread and salt meat. I had resolutely kept my thoughts from the cabin during all the passage but once, and now I found my ideas clustering round a tureen of turtle in spite of all my philosophy.

        5. Confound them, if they had gone out of my hearing with their exulting smacks, I should not have envied their soup, but their hungry glee so excited my imagination that I could see nothing through the glazing[62] of the binnacle[63] but a white plate with a slice of lemon on the rim, a loaf of delicate bread, a silver spoon, a napkin, two or three wine glasses of different hues and shapes, and a water goblet clustering round it, and a stream of black, thick, and fragrant turtle pouring into the plate.



              6. By and by it was four bells: they dined at three. And all the gentlemen, with the captain at their head, darted below into the cabin, where their mirth increased when they caught sight of the soup plates. “Hurry with the soup, steward,” roared the captain. “Coming, sir,” replied the steward. In a few moments the cook opened the door of his galley[64], and out came the delicious steam of the turtle.

        7. Then came the steward with a large covered tureen[65] in his hand, towards the cabin gangway[66]. I forgot the ship for a moment in looking at this precious cargo, the wheel slipped from my hands, the ship broached to with a sudden jerk; the steward had got only one foot upon the stairs, when this unexpected motion threw him off his balance, and down he went by the run, the tureen slipped from his hands, and part of its contents flew into the lee[67] scuppers[68], and the balance followed him in his fall.

        8. I laughed outright. I enjoyed the turtle a thousand times more than I should have done if I had eaten the whole of it. But I was forced to restrain my mirth, for the next moment the steward ran upon deck, followed by the captain, in a furious rage, threatening if he caught him to throw him overboard. Not a spoonful of the soup had been left in the coppers[69], for the steward had taken it all away at once to keep it warm. In about an hour afterwards the passengers came upon deck, looking more sober than I had seen them since we left Liverpool. They had dined upon cold ham.

        查尔斯 · 弗雷德里克 · 布里格斯(1804～1877)出生于美国马萨诸塞州楠塔基特岛，然而年少时便迁居到纽约市。1845年，他与埃德加 · 爱伦 · 坡开始来往，筹办出版《百老汇期刊》。布里格斯与《纽约时报》和《晚镜报》交往密切，1853～1856年期间，他曾担任《普特南杂志》编辑。布里格斯出版过数部小说，若干诗歌以及大量短篇幽默故事和作品。下列章节选自《工作片段》，又称《画线员的生活》，该篇为他最好的小说之一。





        1．船上那只漂亮的绿毛龟有幸列入美味佳肴的名单，那是船长为旅客及他本人准备的。那种龟不可能在海水里喂养，因此待到鸭鸡一干家常肉类悉数消耗殆尽，绿毛龟这才引起饕餮们热情关注。轮船眼看几天后就要抵达目的地了，事情即刻敲定下来，明天船长好好地犒劳大家，这回，绿毛龟也该寿终正寝了。

        2．客舱里的绅士们很久未能品尝鲜肉，随着有肉可啖的消息传开，盯着那位长有坚硬绿壳的朋友，人们眼里无不冒出饥渴绿光。那头龟却是如此不谙人事，嘴里不时发出的吧咂声响亮依然。我偶尔走到船尾，听到那些先生们兴高采烈地谈论期待中的龟汤，甚至还有喷香的五香龟肉丸。有位绅士更为大肆渲染餐宴的规格排场，尽管接下来整整一天，除了啃点发硬的饼干，船上什么吃的也没有，可他，简直为自己那份鲜美醇厚的龟煲汤急不可耐了。

        3．绅士们的欢乐日子到来了，尽管周六才能喝上香槟，今天周五，大家还是一致赞同将香槟日提前，这样看来，龟汤带来的憧憬亦就不会留有任何遗憾了。更何况还有，今天海上风浪很不凑巧地比平常要大，但人们对船上颠簸早已习以为常，更何况还有厨房里喷香的美食诱惑，这些风浪亦就实在不值得计较了。

        4．聚餐前一小时，刚好轮到我在驾驶室里值班，听到那些谈论龟汤的诙谐逗趣不时传来，饥肠辘辘的我，只想弄点面包干夹点咸肉打发肚子。那种痛苦难捱实在饱含诱惑，我身在驾驶舱，尽量努力地克制自己，可一晃眼，发觉眼前飘动的全是那碗美味的龟煲汤。



              5．倘若能逃离这种过大节的嘈杂热闹，恐怕我不会过多计较这些家伙开心的手足舞蹈，不过，他们坐立不安的等待的确勾起我太多联想。当我仔细看着那块镀釉罗盘箱，突然发现里面另有一番天地，白色餐盘上切有一片柠檬摆盘，数片切法精致面包，一枚银汤匙，一方餐巾，三两只不同色彩、形状各异的酒杯，一只高脚杯，统统逐位摆好，最后，那道黑色浓稠、香味扑鼻的龟煲汤优雅地倒入素白瓷盘。

        6．进餐原定三点开始，时间一分一秒地过去，现在已经四点，在船长带领下，一群人一窝蜂冲到舷下餐厅。一看见汤盘，他们戏谑调侃，热闹成团。“大厨，赶紧上菜！”船长朗声叫道。“来了，先生们！”大厨连忙高声答道。须臾间，大厨推开厨房的门，美味浓黏的龟煲汤终于端上来了。

        7．大厨手里捧着一个大号炖煲，朝着旋梯甬道走来，我直盯盯地看着那锅馋人的宝贝，没想到轮盘突然从我手中滑落，船猛地一阵颠簸急扭；大厨刚将一只脚迈上台阶，始料不及的晃荡，使他脚下顿时失去平衡，他啪地摔倒在地，炖锅也脱了手，锅里汤汤水水径直倾入避风道里的排水孔。转眼间，船又恢复了常态行驶。

        8．我畅快地大笑起来，在我看来，那种无数次观赏那只可爱绿毛龟的美妙感觉，应该超过独自喝完那锅炖汤。不过，此刻我更需不露声色，因为那边大厨很快噌噌地跑上了甲板，暴怒万分的船长紧随身后，他边跑边叫，一旦抓住那可恶家伙，就要把他扔进海里。可惜煲里汤水一点亦没剩下，可大厨还是边跑边抱着煲钵不松手，好像唯恐那汤凉了。大约一个时辰后，游客们才纷纷来到甲板，看来，他们比游船起航离开利物浦港口时清醒多了，离岸以来，他们一直以凉咸肉佐餐。





        LESSON 85





THE BEST KIND OF REVENGE


        最好的复仇

        1. Some years ago a warehouseman[70] in Manchester, England, published a scurrilous[71] pamphlet, in which he endeavored to hold up the house of Grant Brothers to ridicule. William Grant remarked upon the occurrence that the man would live to repent of what he had done; and this was conveyed by some talebearer to the libeler[72], who said, “Oh, I suppose he thinks I shall some time or other be in his debt; but I will take good care of that.” It happens, however, that a man in business can not always choose who shall be his creditors. The pamphleteer became a bankrupt, and the brothers held an acceptance of his which had been indorsed to them by the drawer, who had also become a bankrupt.

        2. The wantonly libeled men had thus become creditors of the libeler! They now had it in their power to make him repent of his audacity[73]. He could not obtain his certificate without their signature[74], and without it he could not enter into business again. He had obtained the number of signatures required by the bankrupt law except one. It seemed folly to hope that the firm of “the brothers” would supply the deficiency[75]. What! they who had cruelly been made the laughingstock of the public, forget the wrong and favor the wrongdoer? He despaired. But the claims of a wife and children forced him at last to make the application. Humbled by misery, he presented himself at the countinghouse of the wronged.

        3. Mr. William Grant was there alone, and his first words to the delinquent[76] were, “Shut the door, sir!” sternly uttered. The door was shut, and the libeler stood trembling before the libeled. He told his tale and produced his certificate, which was instantly clutched by the injured merchant. “You wrote a pamphlet against us once!” exclaimed Mr. Grant. The suppliant expected to see his parchment[77] thrown into the fire. But this was not its destination. Mr. Grant took a pen, and writing something upon the document, handed it back to the bankrupt. He, poor wretch, expected to see “rogue, scoundrel, libeler,” inscribed; but there was, in fair round characters, the signature of the firm.

        4. “We make it a rule,” said Mr. Grant, “never to refuse signing the certificate of an honest tradesman, and we have never heard that you were anything else.” The tears started into the poor man’s eyes. “Ah,” said Mr. Grant, “my saying was true! I said you would live to repent writing that pamphlet. I did not mean it as a threat. I only meant that some day you would know us better, and be sorry you had tried to injure us. I see you repent of it now.” “I do, I do!” said the grateful man; “I bitterly repent it.” “Well, well, my dear fellow, you know us now. How do you get on? What are you going to do?” The poor man stated he had friends who could assist him when his certificate was obtained. “But how are you off in the meantime?”



              5. And the answer was, that, having given up every farthing to his creditors, he had been compelled to stint[78] his family of even common necessaries, that he might be enabled to pay the cost of his certificate. “My dear fellow, this will not do; your family must not suffer. Be kind enough to take this ten-pound note to your wife from me. There, there, my dear fellow! Nay, do not cry; it will all be well with you yet. Keep up your spirits, set to work like a man, and you will raise your head among us yet.” The overpowered man endeavored in vain to express his thanks; the swelling in his throat forbade words. He put his handkerchief to his face and went out of the door, crying like a child.

        1．前些年，英国曼彻斯特一位羊毛制品批发商印刷了一本充满粗鄙辱骂的宣传册，文章里不遗余力地公开嘲笑格兰特兄弟机构。一位叫威廉 · 格兰特的人对此进行评价，这家伙将会为他所做的事后悔一生。这句评价被某位搬弄是非的人转告那位肆意诽谤者，后者说：“哦，我猜想，威廉 · 格兰特或许认为，或迟或早我将会欠格兰特兄弟的钱，这一点，我会格外倍加小心。”然而生意场上波谲诡异，谁也无法总能称心如愿地选择自己的债权人。那位批发商，即宣传册的始作俑者不巧破产了，于是他将债权转给一位商人，但那位商人随后同样破产，他无奈之下只好将债权以背书形式转与格兰特兄弟，于是格兰特兄弟最终成为那位羊毛制品批发商的债权人。

        2．由此看来，被侮蔑中伤者居然成了恶毒毁谤者的债权人！如今，格兰特兄弟有能力让那家伙为自己的厚颜无耻埋单。接下来的情况是，如果无法获得债权人的签字认可，那位羊毛制品批发商老板将无法领取他的商业执照；如果没有商业执照，他根本无法再度经商。当时，他获得了破产法要求债权人的签名认可数，最后唯独缺少格兰特公司的签名。如果他指望格兰特兄弟公司能提供法律要求的不足名额签认，看来确实愚蠢至极。天呀！被公众无情耻笑、留作笑柄的格拉特兄弟岂能忘记过错方的肆意诽谤与行为卑劣？那位羊毛批发商老板陷入绝望之中，然而迫于对其妻儿的追索赔偿压力，最终他万般无奈提出申请，怀着痛苦的谦卑心情，来到格兰特兄弟的公司。



              3．威廉 · 格兰特先生独自在办公室里，“关上门，先生。”他对品行低劣者开口说出第一句话，话语相当严厉。门关上了，那位诽谤者颤抖地站在受害人面前，他说出了此行目的，拿出了他的商业执照，遭受肆意诬陷的威廉 · 格兰特先生很快抓住了这份执照，“你写过宣传册恶意诬陷我们！”格兰特先生尖声高叫起来。那位哀求者原以为那份羊皮文稿的执照文本会被扔进火里，但事情结局大出所料，格兰特先生取出一支笔，在文件上写下几个字，然后将其递交与那位破产者。那位可怜的穷光蛋仍然认为会看见“流氓、无赖或诽谤者”诸如此类字样出现在文件上，万万没想到，他竟然看到了字体圆润的格兰特公司签名。

        4．“我们立下规则，”格兰特先生说，“绝不会拒绝为诚信的商人签署证书，我们从未听说你有什么不可以。”眼泪涌入那位可怜人眼眶。“哦，我所说的是真心话，我说过你会活到你后悔写宣传册的那一天，我并不认为这是威胁，只是觉得，总有一天你会更加了解我们，并对无耻伤害我们感到抱歉。我现在看到你的真诚悔过。”“我悔过，我确实错了！”那批发商人感激涕零地说：“我实在后悔我所做的事。”“好了，好了，亲爱的朋友，你现在对我们有了初步了解，你如何经营下去？准备做什么？”那可怜的家伙告诉格兰特先生，一旦他的执照证书拿到后，他的朋友们会给予帮助。“但是，你如何从目前困境中摆脱出来？”

        5．那位批发商告诉格兰特先生，哪怕对自己债权人放弃丁点利益，他也要被迫节省或压缩家庭生活最基本开销，这样才有能力支付执照费用。“亲爱的朋友，这没有用，你的全家不能受罪。从我这拿上十英镑支票给你夫人吧。请收下，收下吧，亲爱的朋友！好了，不要哭了，一切都会好起来的。振作精神，像男人那样承担责任，你一定会在我们中间重新昂起头。”这位内心纠结的汉子竭力想表达他的谢意，然而一切徒然无助。他哽咽地说不出话来，拿出手帕捂住脸，走出门后，顿时像孩子那样嚎啕大哭起来。





        LESSON 86





THE SOLDIER OF THE RHINE


        莱茵河畔的士兵

        Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton (b. 1808, d. 1877) was the grand-daughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She wrote verses and plays at a very early age. “The Sorrows of Rosalie,” published in 1829, was written before she was seventeen years old. In 1827 she was married to the Hon. George Chapple Norton. The marriage was an unhappy one, and they were divorced in 1836. Her principal works are “The Undying One,” “The Dream, and Other Poems,” “The Child of the Islands,” “Stuart of Dunleith, a Romance,” and “English Laws for English Women of the 19th Century.” She contributed extensively to the magazines and other periodicals.





        1. A soldier of the Legion[79] lay dying in Algiers, There was lack of woman’s nursing, there was dearth[80] of woman’s tears;

        But a comrade stood beside him, while his lifeblood ebbed[81] away, And bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.

        The dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade’s hand, And he said: “I nevermore shall see my own, my native land;

        Take a message and a token to some distant friends of mine, For I was born at Bingen,—at Bingen on the Rhine.

        2. “Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around To hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground, That we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done, Full many a corse[82] lay ghastly pale beneath the setting sun;

        And, ’mid the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,—The death wound on their gallant breasts, the last of many scars;

        But some were young, and suddenly beheld life’s morn decline,—And one had come from Bingen,—fair Bingen on the Rhine.

        3. “Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age, For I was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage.

        For my father was a soldier, and, even when a child, My heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;

        And when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard, I let them take whate’er they would, but kept my father’s sword;

        And with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine, On the cottage wall at Bingen,—calm Bingen on the Rhine.





              4. “Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head, When the troops come marching home again, with glad and gallant read, But to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast[83] eye, For her brother was a soldier, too, and not afraid to die;

        And if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame, And to hang the old sword in its place (my father’s sword and mine), For the honor of old Bingen,—dear Bingen on the Rhine.

        5. “There’s another,—not a sister; in the happy days gone by, You’d have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;

        Too innocent for coquetry[84],—too fond for idle scorning,—O friend! I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning!

        Tell her the last night of my life—(for, ere the moon be risen, My body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison), I dreamed I stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine On the vine-clad hills of Bingen,—fair Bingen on the Rhine.

        6. “I saw the blue Rhine sweep along: I heard, or seemed to hear, The German songs we used to sing, in chorus[85] sweet and clear;

        And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill, The echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still;

        And her glad blue eyes were on me, as we passed, with friendly talk, Down many a path beloved of yore[86], and well-remembered walk;

        And her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine,—But we’ll meet no more at Bingen,—loved Bingen all the Rhine.”

        7. His trembling voice grew faint and hoarse; his grasp was childish weak, His eyes put on a dying look,—he sighed and ceased to speak.

        His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled,—The soldier of the Legion in a foreign land was dead!

        And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down On the red sand of the battlefield, with bloody corses strewn;

        Yes, calmly on that dreadful scene, her pale light seemed to shine, As it shone on distant Bingen,—fair Bingen on the Rhine.

              1．一位德国军团士兵，在阿尔及尔战场上濒临死亡，那里缺医少药，缺少医护照料，他的血快要流尽了。站在他身边的同伴，眼里满是悲哀，弯下身想听听他的最后遗言。这时，那位垂死的士兵抓住同伴的手，颤抖地对他说：“我再也见不到我家乡的土地了，请捎个消息回去，再带个物件，转交我远方的朋友，我出生在宾根，——莱茵河畔的宾根。

        2．“当我的父老乡亲聚集到家乡那个美丽的葡萄园时，他们将听到我的噩耗，请告诉家乡的朋友们，我和我的战友们作战勇猛。今天就要消失了，夕阳下，地上到处堆满面容惨白的尸体，那些死者和濒死者中间，多少人因战争变得苍老，死亡将在他们勇敢的心里留下深深伤口，那是残酷记忆中难以愈合的伤疤。还有些战士那么年轻，他们亲眼目睹生命的遽然衰亡。一个来自宾根的战士，——莱茵河畔美丽的宾根。

        3．“请告诉我的妈妈，她的其他儿子们将会陪她度过余生。我是一只逃学的小鸟，尽管家不过是只狭窄的鸟笼。我的父亲也是士兵，当我还是孩子时，总是急切地盼望他讲述过去惨烈悲壮的战斗。父亲死后，当全家处理父亲那点微薄的遗产时，我让兄弟们随意拿取他们想要的东西，只给自己留下父亲的一把剑。怀着一个孩子真挚的爱，我将那把剑挂好，挂在阳光可以照到的宾根普通农家的墙上，——莱茵河畔安宁的宾根。

        4．“请告诉我的姐妹，不要为我哭泣，不要低下悲伤的头。当我们的部队重新胜利凯旋，请为他们感到骄傲。以冷静坚定的骄傲目光欢迎他们，因为她们的兄弟也是一位士兵。无需畏惧死亡。假如有位战士追求我的姐妹，我请求她们以我的名义认真倾听他的叙说，不要后悔或感到羞耻，将那把古老的剑，那把父亲和我共同拥有的战剑在原先位置挂好，为了古老宾根的荣耀，——莱茵河畔可爱的宾根。

        5．“还有一位姑娘并非我的姐妹，在过去幸福时光里，从她眼里的欣喜闪光，我读懂了她。她那天真无邪的撒娇，若无其事的嘲弄。哦，亲爱的朋友！我唯恐你最为细微的心里承受太多悲哀！请告诉她我生命中最后一夜——（因为，月亮升起之前，我的身体将脱离痛苦，我的灵魂将离开囚禁之地），我梦想与她牵手伫立，一起漫步在满山葡萄藤缠绕的山巅，眺望宾根的金色日出，——莱茵河畔宏伟的宾根。

        6．“我看见蓝色的宾根在飞奔勇进，我听见，哦，似乎听见，那些我们曾经反复吟唱的德国战歌，那甜蜜清澈的和声，随着欢快河流奔腾流泻。那美妙旋律回荡在风光巍峨的群山，穿透夜晚的安宁静谧。当我们手牵手依偎徜徉，她那双幸福的蓝眼睛看着我。那条镌刻下古老爱恋的幽静小路，难以忘怀的小路，她柔软小手轻轻地放到我的手上，与我互吐衷肠。然而，我们此生再亦不会在宾根重逢相遇，莱茵河畔的所有，——迷人的宾根。”



              7．他颤抖的声音愈来愈虚弱嘶哑；他的手亦轻飘无力，他的眼神现出濒死之光，他怅叹一声。不再说话。他的战友急忙蹲下扶起他，但他的生命火花急遽黯淡，那位德国军团士兵最终客死在他乡！温柔的月亮缓慢升起，它冷冰冰地望着那片浸满殷红鲜血的战场，月光下，尸体纷乱杂陈，呈现出一幕可怖景象。那缕惨白月光撒在异乡的土地，如同它照耀在遥远的宾根，——莱茵河畔妖娆美丽的宾根。

THE WINGED WORSHIPERS


        天 使

        Charles Sprague (b. 1791, d. 1875) was born in Boston, Mass. He engaged in mercantile business when quite young, leaving school for that purpose. In 1825, he was elected cashier of the Globe Bank of Boston, which position he held until 1864. Mr. Sprague has not been a prolific writer; but his poems, though few in number, are deservedly classed among the best productions of American poets. His chief poem is entitled “Curiosity.”





        1. Gay, guiltless pair,

        What seek ye from the fields of heaven?

        Ye have no need of prayer,

        Ye have no sins to be forgiven.





        2. Why perch[87] ye here,

        Where mortals to their Maker bend?

        Can your pure spirits fear

        The God ye never could offend?





        3. Ye never knew

        The crimes for which we come to weep;

        Penance[88] is not for you,

        Blessed wanderers of the upper deep.





        4. To you ’t is given

        To wake sweet Nature’s untaught lays[89];

        Beneath the arch of heaven

        To chirp away a life of praise.





        5. Then spread each wing,

        Far, far above, o’er lakes and lands,

        And join the choirs[90] that sing

        In yon blue dome[91] not reared with hands.





              6. Or, if ye stay

        To note the consecrated[92] hour,

        Teach me the airy way,

        And let me try your envied power.





        7. Above the crowd,

        On upward wings could I but fly,

        I’d bathe in yon bright cloud,

        And seek the stars that gem the sky.





        8. ’T were Heaven indeed,

        Through fields of trackless[93] light to soar,

        On Nature’s charms to feed,

        And Nature’s own great God adore.

        1．同性恋男人，好一对清纯妙人，

        天国辽阔， 你们在寻找什么？

        当然，你们无需祷告，

        原本清白， 更无宽恕可言。





        2． 为什么，你们栖息这里，

        凡胎肉躯，为何要向上帝赎罪？

        难道说，纯粹爱恋让天主恐惧，

        那位，你们未曾冒犯的天神？





        3．你们不知，我们前来哭泣的罪恶，

        你们并非，我们百般纠结的缘由，

        祝福的人儿，御风而去，

        那些身影，早已绝尘高远。



              4．永恒之光，唤醒你的内心

        深如天然歌声，率真本性，

        云天浩渺，圣殿拱门下，

        鸟声啁啾飞走， 赞美生命。





        5．接着，展开每一道翅膀，

        振翼高飞，越过海洋大地，

        应合着， 那些天籁之韵，

        飞进弯庐，见证恢宏的奇迹。





        6．或者你们，盘桓于天空，

        目睹，那一神性时刻的到来，

        教会我， 恣意快乐地飞翔，

        让我尝试令人钦羡的力量。





        7．人群之上， 凡尘之上，

        我无以所能，唯有乘风直上，

        我向往，远方亮丽云朵下沐浴，

        细数无尽，天空的繁星神秘。





        8．诚然，穿越那些人迹罕至

        光的原野， 穿越神奇未知，

        生命本能的充满魔咒勃发，

        连上帝也膜拜， 人性高贵的灵动。

THE PEEVISH WIFE


        暴躁易怒的妻子

        Maria Edgeworth (b. 1767, d. 1849) was born near Reading. Berkshire, England. In 1782 her father removed with his family to Edgeworthtown, Ireland, to reside on his estate. She lived here during the remainder of her life, with the exception of occasional short visits to England, Scotland, and France. She was educated principally by her father, and they were colaborers in literary productions, among which were “Essays on Practical Education,” and the “Parent’s Assistant.” Her novels and tales were written without assistance, and her fame as a writer rests on them. The best known of these are “Castle Rackrent,” “Moral Tales,” “Tales of Fashionable Life,” “Frank,” “The Modern Griselda,” and “Helen.” Miss Edgeworth excels in the truthful delineation of character, and her works are full of practical good sense and genuine humor.

        Mrs. Bollingbroke. I wish I knew what was the matter with me this morning. Why do you keep the newspaper all to yourself, my dear?

        Mr. Bolingbroke. Here it is for you, my dear; I have finished it.

        Mrs. B. I humbly thank you for giving it to me when you have done with it. I hate stale news. Is there anything in the paper? for I can not be at the trouble of hunting it.

        Mr. B. Yes, my dear; there are the marriages of two of our friends.

        Mrs.B. Who? Who?

        Mr. B. Your friend, the widow Nettleby, to her cousin John Nettleby.

        Mrs. B. Mrs. Nettleby? Dear! But why did you tell me?

        Mr. B. Because you asked me, my dear.

        Mrs. B. Oh, but it is a hundred times pleasanter to read the paragraph one’s self. One loses all the pleasure of the surprise by being told. Well, whose was the other marriage?

        Mr. B. Oh, my dear, I will not tell you; I will leave you the pleasure of the surprise.

        Mrs. B. But you see I can not find it. How provoking you are, my dear! Do pray tell me.

        Mr. B. Our friend Mr. Granby.

        Mrs. B. Mr. Granby? Dear! Why did you not make me guess? I should have guessed him directly. But why do you call him our friend? I am sure he is no friend of mine, nor ever was. I took an aversion to him, as you remember, the very first day I saw him. I am sure he is no friend of mine.

        Mr. B. I am sorry for it, my dear; but I hope you will go and see Mrs. Granby.

        Mrs. B. Not I, indeed, my dear. Who was she?

        Mr. B. Miss Cooke.

        Mrs. B. Cooke? But, there are so many Cookes. Can’t you distinguish her any way? Has she no Christian name?

        Mr. B. Emma, I think. Yes, Emma.



              Mrs. B. Emma Cooke? No; it can not be my friend Emma Cooke; for I am sure she was cut out for an old maid.

        Mr. B. This lady seems to me to be cut out for a good wife.

        Mrs. B. Maybe so. I am sure I’ll never go to see her. Pray, my dear, how came you to see so much of her?

        Mr. B. I have seen very little of her, my dear. I only saw her two or three times before she was married.

        Mrs. B. Then, my dear, how could you decide that she was cut out for a good wife? I am sure you could not judge of her by seeing her only two or three times, and before she was married.

        Mr. B. Indeed, my love, that is a very just observation.

        Mrs. B. I understand that compliment perfectly, and thank you for it, my dear. I must own I can bear anything better than irony[94].

        Mr. B. Irony? my dear, I was perfectly in earnest.

        Mrs. B. Yes, yes; in earnest; so I perceive; I may naturally be dull of apprehension, but my feelings are quick enough; I comprehend too well. Yes, it is impossible to judge of a woman before marriage, or to guess what sort of a wife she will make. I presume you speak from experience; you have been disappointed yourself, and repent your choice.

        Mr. B. My dear, what did I say that was like this? Upon my word, I meant no such thing. I really was not thinking of you in the least.

        Mrs. B. No, you never think of me now. I can easily believe that you were not thinking of me in the least.

        Mr. B. But I said that only to prove to you that I could not be thinking ill of you, my dear.

        Mrs. B. But I would rather that you thought ill of me than that you should not think of me at all.

        Mr. B. Well, my dear, I will even think ill of you if that will please you.

        Mrs. B. Do you laugh at me? When it comes to this I am wretched indeed. Never man laughed at the woman he loved. As long as you had the slightest remains of love for me you could not make me an object of derision[95]; ridicule and love are incompatible[96], absolutely incompatible. Well, I have done my best, my very best, to make you happy, but in vain. I see I am not cut out to be a good wife. Happy, happy Mrs. Granby!

        Mr. B. Happy, I hope sincerely, that she will be with my friend; but my happiness must depend on you, my love; so, for my sake, if not for your own, be composed, and do not torment yourself with such fancies.

        Mrs. B. I do wonder whether this Mrs. Granby is really that Miss Emma Cooke. I’ll go and see her directly; see her I must.

        Mr. B. I am heartily glad of it, my dear; for I am sure a visit to his wife will give my friend Granby real pleasure.

        Mrs. B. I promise you, my dear, I do not go to give him pleasure, or you either, but to satisfy my own curiosity.

        博林布鲁克夫人：我今天早晨真是活见鬼了，亲爱的，怎么你一直抱着报纸不放？

        博林布鲁克先生：亲爱的，给你，我才看完。

        夫人：读完就递给我，真要感谢劳您大驾了。我讨厌过时的新闻，报纸上有什么消息不？我可不愿费神找。

        先生：亲爱的，报上报道了我们两对朋友的婚礼。

        夫人：那谁和谁？

        先生：你的朋友，寡妇奈特比和她的表兄约翰 · 奈特比。

        夫人：奈特比夫人？你为什么告诉我这些？

        先生：你问我的，亲爱的。

        夫人：嗨，不管怎么说，还是自己读到这类消息感觉要有趣得多！你这么一开口，我所有的快乐惊奇一点儿也没啦，好了，还有一对呢？

        先生：哦，亲爱的，我不会再说了，就把那快乐惊奇留给你自己吧。

        夫人：你看不出来，我找不到吗，你怎么这样烦人？做做好事，夫君，快点告诉我。

        先生：还有一对是我们的朋友格兰比。

        夫人：格兰比先生？我的妈呀！你怎么不让我再猜猜呢？我原本一下子就能猜到的，可你为什么说他是我们的朋友？他肯定不是我的朋友，从来都不是，我那么讨厌他，你该记得，从我遇见他第一天起，我就说过，我可绝没这么个朋友。

        先生：对不起，亲爱的，不过我还是希望你去看看格兰比夫人。



              夫人：我也不会去，真的，亲爱的，那她是谁呀？

        先生：库克小姐。

        夫人：库克？但是，叫库克的太多了，你难道记不住什么特别的？她没有教名吗？

        先生：爱玛，我想想，噢，对了，她叫爱玛。

        夫人：爱玛 · 库克？不会的，不可能是我的朋友爱玛 · 库克，我知道，她可是个天生的老处女。

        先生：依我看，那位女士倒是天生的好妻子。

        夫人：或许吧。我知道了，我绝对不会去看她，请问一下，亲爱的，你恐怕见过她很多次吧？

        先生：我很少见到她，亲爱的，她结婚前，我见到她两三次。

        夫人：既然这样，亲爱的，你怎么就能断定，她天生就是个好妻子呢？我觉得，她结婚前，即便你见上三两次，恐怕也不能做出如此判断吧。

        先生：不错，宝贝儿，恰恰就是那少见的印象。

        夫人：我太清楚你的恭维了，谢谢你，亲爱的。我必须承认，我什么都吃得住，就是吃不了你的冷嘲热讽。

        先生：冷嘲热讽？亲爱的，我可是相当认真的。

        夫人：是的，是的，相当认真，这样，我才能觉察到。我生来理性愚钝，可就是感性太快，领悟力极强。这么说吧，婚姻前不可能对一个女人做出正确判断，或者猜测你的妻子属于什么类型，我推测你这样说由于你的经验之谈，你一直对自己感到沮丧，那么后悔当初的选择。

        先生：亲爱的，我说了什么？难道有这些意思？回想我说的话，完全不是这么回事，我压根没想到你会这么想。

        夫人：压根没想到，你现在怎能想到我，显而易见，你根本不会想到我。

        先生：可是，我刚才说的只不过向你表明，我不可能把你想歪了，亲爱的。

        夫人：可是，我宁愿你把我想歪，也比你一点不想我要强。

        先生：好了，亲爱的，如果能让你高兴，那我就把你想歪喽。

        夫人：你嘲笑我？要真是这样，我可就太悲催了。一个男人从不讥笑他所喜爱的女人，哪怕你对我还有一丁点爱，你也不会让我成为你嘲弄的对象，愚弄与爱不可调和，绝对不可以。好了，我一直尽最大努力，使出浑身解数想使你开心快乐，结果到头，整个一场空欢喜。我知道，我天生就不是个好妻子。格兰比夫人，开心快乐！见你个大头鬼吧！



              先生：开心快乐点，这是我的真心话，她只是和我的朋友一起生活，但我的幸福当然取决于你，我的宝贝，为我想想，哪怕不是为你自己，心静点，别让这些念头折磨你自己。

        夫人：我就是想弄清楚，这个格兰比夫人究竟是不是爱玛 · 库克小姐？我现在就去，我必须亲自查看明白。

        先生：亲爱的，听你这么说，我真高兴。我相信，你去拜访格兰比夫人，我的朋友格兰比简直会开心坏了。

        夫人：亲爱的，我可告诉你，我去他家，可不是让你的朋友开心，亦不在乎你是否高兴，我就是要亲眼看看那个格兰比夫人究竟长得什么样。

THE RAINY DAY


        雨 天



        1. The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;

        It rains, and the wind is never weary;

        The vine still clings to the moldering wall,

        But at every gust the dead leaves fall.

        And the day is dark and dreary.





        2. My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;

        It rains, and the wind is never weary;

        My thoughts still cling to the moldering Past,

        But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,

        And the days are dark and dreary.





        3. Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;

        Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;

        Thy fate is the common fate of all,

        Into each life some rain must fall,

        Some days must be dark and dreary.

        (Longfellow)

        狂风乍起， 落叶舞起凋零，

        2. 我的日子， 犹如郁郁寡欢落雨，

        淅沥雨丝， 涂抹冬天忧郁，

              曾经豪情， 铺砌一地枯黄，

        悲欢几许， 难遣心中惆怅。





        3. 伤痛的心，暗自不再抱怨，

        云层后面，穿越阳光万里，

        痛苦凝结，最后珍藏的记忆。

BREAK, BREAK, BREAK


        万马千钧

        Alfred Tennyson (b. 1809, d. 1892) was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire, England. He graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first volume of poems was published in 1830, but it made little impression and was severely criticised. On the publication of his third series in 1842, his poetic genius began to receive general recognition. Mr. Tennyson was made poet laureate in 1850, and was regarded as the foremost living poet of England. For several years his residence was on the Isle of Wight. In 1884, he was raised to the peerage.





        1. Break, break, break,

        On thy cold gray stones, O sea!

        And I would that my tongue could utter

        The thoughts that arise in me.





        2. Oh, well for the fisherman’s boy,

        That he shouts with his sister at play!

        Oh, well for the sailor lad,

        That he sings in his boat on the bay!





        3. And the stately ships go on

        To their haven under the hill;

        But oh for the touch of a vanished hand,

        And the sound of a voice that is still!





        4. Break, break, break,

        At the foot of thy crags, O sea!

        But the tender grace of a day that is dead

        Will never come back to me.

TRANSPORTATION AND PLANTING OF SEEDS


        种子的传播与种植

        Henry David Thoreau (b. 1817, d. 1862). This eccentric American author and naturalist was born at Concord, Mass. He graduated at Harvard University in 1837. He was a good English and classical scholar, and was well acquainted with the literature of the East. His father was a maker of lead pencils, and he followed the business for a time, but afterwards supported himself mainly by teaching, lecturing, land surveying, and carpentering. In 1845 he built himself a small wooden house near Concord, on the shore of Walden Pond, where he lived about two years. He was intimate with Hawthorne, Emerson, and other literary celebrities. His principal works are “Walden, or Life in the Woods,” “A Week on Concord and Merrimac Rivers,” “Excursions,” “Maine Woods,” “Cape Cod,” “A Yankee in Canada,” and “Letters to Various Persons.” In descriptive power Mr. Thoreau has few, if any, superiors.





        1. In all the pines a very thin membrane[1], in appearance much like an insect’s wing, grows over and around the seed, and independent of it, while the latter is being developed within its base. In other words, a beautiful thin sack is woven around the seed, with a handle to it such as the wind can take hold of, and it is then committed to the wind, expressly that it may transport the seed and extend the range of the species; and this it does as effectually as when seeds are sent by mail, in a different kind of sack, from the patent office.

        2. There is, then, no necessity for supposing that the pines have sprung up from nothing, and I am aware that I am not at all peculiar in asserting that they come from seeds, though the mode of their propagation[2] by Nature has been but little attended to. They are very extensively raised from the seed in Europe, and are beginning to be here.

        3. When you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will not at once spring up there unless there are, or have been quite recently, seed-bearing pines near enough for the seeds to be blown from them. But, adjacent to a forest of pines, if you prevent other crops from growing there, you will surely have an extension of your pine forest, provided the soil is suitable.

        4. As I walk amid hickories, even in August, I hear the sound of green pignuts falling from time to time, cut off by the chickaree over my head. In the fall I notice on the ground, either within or in the neighborhood of oak woods, on all sides of the town, stout oak twigs three or four inches long, bearing half a dozen empty acorn cups, which twigs have been gnawed off by squirrels, on both sides of the nuts, in order to make them more portable[3]. The jays scream and the red squirrels scold while you are clubbing and shaking the chestnut trees, for they are there on the same errand, and two of a trade never agree.



              5. I frequently see a red or a gray squirrel cast down a green chestnut burr, as I am going through the woods, and I used to think, sometimes, that they were cast at me. In fact, they are so busy about it, in the midst of the chestnut season, that you can not stand long in the woods without hearing one fall.

        6. A sportsman told me that he had, the day before—that was in the middle of October—seen a green chestnut burr dropped on our great river meadow, fifty rods from the nearest wood, and much farther from the nearest chestnut tree, and he could not tell how it came there. Occasionally, when chestnutting in midwinter, I find thirty or forty nuts in a pile, left in its gallery just under the leaves, by the common wood mouse.

        7. But especially, in the winter, the extent to which this transportation[4] and planting of nuts is carried on, is made apparent by the snow. In almost every wood you will see where the red or gray squirrels have pawed down through the snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet deep, and almost always directly to a nut or a pine cone, as directly as if they had started from it and bored upward,—which you and I could not have done. It would be difficult for us to find one before the snow falls. Commonly, no doubt, they had deposited them there in the fall. You wonder if they remember the localities or discover them by the scent.

        8. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under a thicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of evergreens in the midst of a deciduous[5] wood. If there are any nut trees, which still retain their nuts, standing at a distance without the wood, their paths often lead directly to and from them. We, therefore, need not suppose an oak standing here and there in the wood in order to seed it, but if a few stand within twenty or thirty rods of it, it is sufficient.

        9. I think that I may venture to say that every white-pine cone that falls to the earth naturally in this town, before opening and losing its seeds, and almost every pitch-pine one that falls at all, is cut off by a squirrel; and they begin to pluck them long before they are ripe, so that when the crop of white-pine cones is a small one, as it commonly is, they cut off thus almost everyone of these before it fairly ripens.

        10. I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so speak, in cutting them off green, is partly to prevent their opening and losing their seeds, for these are the ones for which they dig through the snow, and the only white-pine cones which contain anything then. I have counted in one heap the cores of two hundred and thirty-nine pitch-pine cones which had been cut off and stripped by the red squirrel the previous winter.



        11. The nuts thus left on the surface, or buried just beneath it, are placed in the most favorable circumstances for germinating[6]. I have sometimes wondered how those which merely fell on the surface of the earth got planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of the same year partially mixed with the mold, as it were, under the decaying and moldy leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure they want, for the nuts fall fast. In a plentiful year a large proportion of the nuts are thus covered loosely an inch deep, and are, of course, somewhat concealed from squirrels.

        12. One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid of a rake, many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of January; and though some bought at the store the same day were more than half of them moldy, I did not find a single moldy one among those which I picked from under the wet and moldy leaves, where they had been snowed on once or twice. Nature knew how to pack them best. They were still plump and tender. Apparently they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring they are all sprouting.



              13. Occasionally, when threading the woods in the fall, you will hear a sound as if some one had broken a twig, and, looking up, see a jay pecking at an acorn, or you will see a flock of them at once about it, in the top of an oak, and hear them break it off. They then fly to a suitable limb, and placing the acorn under one foot, hammer away at it busily, making a sound like a woodpecker’s tapping, looking round from time to time to see if any foe is approaching, and soon reach the meat, and nibble at it, holding up their heads to swallow while they hold the remainder very firmly with their claws. Nevertheless, it often drops to the ground before the bird has done with it.



        14. I can confirm what William Barton wrote to Wilson, the ornithologist[7], that “The jay is one of the most useful agents in the economy[8] of nature for disseminating[9] forest trees and other nuciferous[10] and hard-seeded vegetables on which they feed. In performing this necessary duty they drop abundance of seed in their flight over fields, hedges, and by fences, where they alight to deposit them in the post holes, etc. It is remarkable what numbers of young trees rise up in fields and pastures after a wet winter and spring. These birds alone are capable in a few years' time to replant all the cleared lands.”

        15. I have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop nuts in open land, which will still further account for the oaks and walnuts which spring up in pastures; for, depend on it, every new tree comes from a seed. When I examine the little oaks, one or two years old, in such places, I invariably find the empty acorn from which they sprung.

        1． 松树种子通常长有一层薄膜，形状酷似昆虫翅膀，独立的薄膜裹住并庇护种子生长，使种子得以在根基部孕育；换句话说，就像把种子裹护在漂亮细薄的网袋里，让风擎住从网袋里长出的一个小小把手，把种子命运交与风来主宰。未来的风儿就可裹带种子翱翔，为植物种群繁衍开拓疆土。与专利局袋装邮寄包裹相比，种子职能卓有成效，毫不逊色。

        3．当你砍斫一片橡树林，北美油松林几乎不可能很快继之而起，除非原先就已成林，或已具相当规模，并且砍伐地带不远处还应长有结籽的松树，种子才有可能吹来萌发。不过，就松林周边而言，万一土壤适宜，同时确保其他作物无法生长，你也势必将会拥有一片扩展的松林。

        4．甚至8月期间，当我走在山核桃林里，头顶上端不时传来山核桃被山雀啄落的声音，果子还绿茵茵的。秋天，在小镇周围橡树林里或树林附近，我留意到三四英寸长的粗短橡树枝，挂着七八个空空的橡实壳，松鼠咬断坚果两侧硬枝，完全出于搬运简单方便。每当人们敲打或摇晃栗树，便招来松鸦、红松鼠叽喳不停，它们，抑或我们，光顾森林的目的没什么不同，所谓同行冤家，一点不假。

        5．行在树林中，我经常看见红松鼠或灰松鼠扔下带芒刺的绿色栗果，我总觉得，它们想必是冲我砸来的。栗子成熟季节，松鼠忙碌地奔跑，只需在树林中稍站片刻，便能清晰地听见栗子的落地声。

        6．一位喜欢捕猎的朋友对我说，就在前一天，该是10月中旬吧，他还看见一颗绿色带芒刺的栗果，丢在小镇大河边的湿地草原上。那颗栗果离最近的林子有五十杆距离，距最近的栗树林就更远了，他实在想不出那粒栗子究竟从哪冒出来的。深冬季节，我有时去森林里采摘栗子，有时会发现三四十颗栗子聚拢成堆，裹藏在腐叶下森林里常见的林鼠洞边。

        7．白雪皑皑的冬天，松鼠们忙碌搬运、种植松果的活动更为清晰可见。几乎每一片森林里，不难看见数以百计处红松鼠、灰松鼠扒拉雪地的痕迹。有时地面积雪甚至深达两英尺，沿雪洞径直伸手掏下去，坚果或松果每每手到擒来。这些洞穴布局精巧，洞口好像从地底向上挖掘，松鼠们那么得心应手，或许我们只有望洋兴叹。即便雪没下，我们要想找到一粒坚果也极为不易，更别提大雪封山了。当然，松鼠们秋天贮藏下果实，但它们怎样才能记牢那些储藏地，或仅凭气味找到果子，其中奥秘令人费解。



              8．冬天，松鼠通常在常青林灌丛下安家筑穴，洞穴周围最好有落叶乔木小簇灌丛环绕左右，如果洞穴附近有橡树，甚至树上还挂着果，中途没有其他林木遮蔽，那么，松鼠只是在洞穴与挂果树间穿梭奔波，我们亦无须认为，森林里到处应长有橡树，二十到三十杆间隔有那么三两株，播种也就绰绰有余了。



        9．我不妨大胆设想一下，果实尚未裂开或飞落前，就自然落地的小镇上几乎每一颗白松松果来说，全部拜赐松鼠的采摘；那时松果成熟还早，果实还小，松鼠们便早早开始动手了。一般来说，它们几乎不会错过秋天里每一粒珍贵收获。

        10．此外，依据松鼠设想，我是否可以这么猜测，松树果实尚青嫩生涩，松鼠们便迫不及待地开始采摘，一方面在于它们唯恐裂落地，失却到嘴的美食；至于那些落地的白松松籽，或许直到冬天来临，松鼠才能从积雪里挖出，那可是漫长冬季里唯一贮有种子的活命粮。我曾发现一堆松果，那是上一个冬季红松鼠啮咬撕扯后藏匿下的，我数了数，竟有二百三十九颗松果。

        11．坚果被丢弃地面或浅埋土壤，给种子提供了极易萌发的环境，但我有时还是无法明白，那些落到地表的种子如何就能发芽？12月末，我通过观察后发现，当年生栗子落地后，部分外壳已霉变，残枝颓叶混杂覆盖地层，落地栗子从而获得必需的湿濡与营养。挂果多的年头，大多落地坚果上覆盖着腐泥颓叶，深达一英寸，藏匿在稀疏软泥下的果实，起码可躲过松鼠一劫。

        12．有年冬天，适逢栗树丰年，待到翌年1月10日，我用钉耙还从林子里挖出好几夸脱栗子，而恰好那天我从店里也买回一些栗子，可多半已霉坏变质。那年冬天，落过一两场雪了，从积雪覆盖的颓败叶泥下挖出的栗子，依然新鲜如初。栗子极易变质，大自然擅长保鲜之术，只要落叶濡湿，温度适宜，冬去春来，栗子便争先恐后露出胚芽。

        13．秋季穿过树林，或许听见类似有人折断树枝的窸窣，抬头望去，原来是只正在啄食橡果的松鸦，可能亦有成群松鸦在树梢上下翻飞啄食，窸窣声声不断。倏尔，它们又飞到其他树梢，一只爪子踩着橡实不停敲打，发出类似啄木鸟的笃笃声，时而左顾右盼，留意是否有敌人悄悄逼近。鸟儿很快啄到了果肉，先是小口啄食，继尔仰头吞咽，爪子还紧紧抓着残剩果肉，尚有些橡实鸟喙未动，就已掉落地上。

        14．依我来看，威廉 · 巴特拉姆写给鸟类学家威尔森信中这段话颇有道理：

        在大自然经济活动中，松鸦是极有用的掮客。它以坚果为食，同时将结有坚果或硬籽的森林种子到处传播。为履行这一必要职责，松鸦在飞越田野，或驻脚树篱栅栏，或欲将粮食坚藏入洞而往返奔波时，遗落大量种子。历经连绵淫雨的冬春两季，田野或平原到处窜出无数树苗。单单这种能干的松鸦，无需几年，就能将所有垦荒地再度植被造林。





              15．松鼠时常在空旷地丢弃坚果，这点，我一直注意观察，这种现象可进一步解释，橡树和核桃树为何在牧场上萌生而出，因此，每一棵新生树木的萌发皆来自种子。当我察看一两年生的小橡树时，总会在树木发芽的地方看到种子空壳，无一例外。

SPRING AGAIN


        又见春天

        Celia Thaxter (b. 1836, d. 1894), whose maiden name was Laighton, was born in Portsmouth, N.H. Much of her early life was passed on White Island, one of a group of small islands, called the Isles of Shoals, about ten miles from the shore, where she lived in the lighthouse cottage. In 1867-68, she published, in the “Atlantic Monthly,” a number of papers on these islands, which were afterwards bound in a separate volume. Mrs. Thaxter was a contributor to several periodicals, and in strength and beauty of style has few equals among American writers. The following selection is from a volume of her poems entitled “Drift Weed.”





        1. I stood on the height in the stillness

        And the planet’s outline scanned,

        And half was drawn with the line of sea

        And half with the far blue land.





        2. With wings that caught the sunshine

        In the crystal deeps of the sky,

        Like shapes of dreams, the gleaming gulls

        Went slowly floating by.





        3. Below me the boats in the harbor

        Lay still, with their white sails furled;

        Sighing away into silence,

        The breeze died off the world.





        4. On the weather-worn, ancient ledges

        Peaceful the calm light slept;

        And the chilly shadows, lengthening,

        Slow to the eastward crept.





        5. The snow still lay in the hollows,

        And where the salt waves met

        The iron rock, all ghastly white

        The thick ice glimmered yet.





        6. But the smile of the sun was kinder,

        The touch of the air was sweet;

        The pulse of the cruel ocean seemed

        Like a human heart to beat.



              7. Frost-locked, storm-beaten, and lonely,

        In the midst of the wintry main,

        Our bleak rock yet the tidings heard:

        “There shall be spring again!”





        8. Worth all the waiting and watching,

        The woe that the winter wrought,

        Was the passion of gratitude that shook

        My soul at the blissful thought!





        9. Soft rain and flowers and sunshine,

        Sweet winds and brooding skies,

        Quick-flitting birds to fill the air

        With clear delicious cries;





        10. And the warm sea’s mellow murmur

        Resounding day and night;

        A thousand shapes and tints and tones

        Of manifold delight,





        11. Nearer and ever nearer

        Drawing with every day!

        But a little longer to wait and watch

        ’Neath skies so cold and gray;

        12. And hushed is the roar of the bitter north

        Before the might of the spring,

        And up the frozen slope of the world

        Climbs summer, triumphing.

        1．静寂无声， 我站在高处云巅，

        放眼望去， 脚下星球飞转，

        一半海岸， 深邃蕴含着神秘，

        一半陆地， 径直向远方伸展。



              2．我以双翼， 扑向金色阳光 ，

        急旋腾空， 融进绚丽苍穹，

        梦幻缥缈， 星光云海里海鸥，

        恍若仙境， 从我的衣袂飞过。





        3．回眸脚下，海港里的小船，

        静静停泊，卷起白色风帆，

        缄默无声，长舒一声怅叹，

        微风若许，不知所踪飘远。





        4．古老暗礁，滚过多少风暴，

        一道永恒，光明枕入睡眠，

        愈见拉长阴影，寒寂苍凉，

        缓慢滞重，潜行东方归去。





        5．白雪皑皑，雍积在礁石凹穴，

        海浪扑来，一次次冲刷炸裂，

        巉岩耸立，惨白恐怖的嶙峋，

        影影绰绰，厚实的冰凌覆现。





        6．太阳笑脸，更为温柔清馨，

        微风和煦，相逢甜蜜难言，

        残暴大海，那摧毁一切的

        跳动脉搏，心在滴血震颤。





        7．风霜侵蚀，惯于孤独面对，

        雨雪交加，矗立沧海横流，

        擎天一柱，海潮已经听见，

        又见春天，春天又绿人间。





              8． 所有一切，值得耐心等待，

        所有悲哀，冬天早已走远，

        感恩的心，高亢跳跃激情，

        我的灵魂，在春天韵律里放歌。





        9．春雨潇潇，阳光下的花丛，

        风和日丽，天空云层低垂，

        铺天盖地，那飞掠的候鸟，

        传来久违，声声清脆鸣啾。





        10．低声细语，海洋中锦葵植物，

        日夜不停，叙说着海底神奇，

        姹紫嫣红，万般旖旎的美景，

        水天一色，汇聚成欢乐颂歌。





        11．脚步更近， 春天渐渐走进，

        一天天呵， 希望即将来临，

        姑且等待， 不过坚忍片刻，

        长空万里， 阴霾终将远离。





        12．终于抵达，三月风明媚春天，

        北风停止，往昔肆虐的呼啸，

        夏日冉冉，爬上那冰雪覆盖

        高山之巅，抖落长久的欢欣。





        LESSON 93





RELIGION THE ONLY BASIS OF SOCIETY


        宗教——社会的唯一基石

        William Ellery Channing (b. 1780, d. 1842), an eminent divine and orator, was born at Newport, R.I. He graduated from Harvard with the highest honors in 1798, and, in 1803, he was made pastor of the Federal Street Church, Boston, with which he maintained his connection until his death. Towards the close of his life, being much enfeebled, he withdrew almost entirely from his pastoral duties, and devoted himself to literature. Dr. Channing’s writings are published in six volumes, and are mainly devoted to theology.





        1. Religion is a social concern; for it operates powerfully on society, contributing in various ways to its stability and prosperity. Religion is not merely a private affair; the community[11] is deeply interested in its diffusion[12]; for it is the best support of the virtues and principles, on which the social order rests. Pure and undefiled religion is to do good; and it follows, very plainly, that if God be the Author and Friend of society, then, the recognition of him must enforce all social duty, and enlightened[13] piety must give its whole strength to public order.

        2. Few men suspect, perhaps no man comprehends, the extent of the support given by religion to every virtue. No man, perhaps, is aware how much our moral and social sentiments are fed from this fountain; how powerless conscience would become without the belief of a God; how palsied would be human benevolence, were there not the sense of a higher benevolence to quicken and sustain it; how suddenly the whole social fabric[14] would quake, and with what a fearful crash it would sink into hopeless ruin, were the ideas of a Supreme Being, of accountableness and of a future life to be utterly erased[15] from every mind.

        3. And, let men thoroughly believe that they are the work and sport of chance; that no superior intelligence concerns itself with human affairs; that all their improvements perish forever at death; that the weak have no guardian, and the injured no avenger; that there is no recompense for sacrifices to uprightness and the public good; that an oath is unheard in heaven; that secret crimes have no witness but the perpetrator[16]; that human existence has no purpose, and human virtue no unfailing friend; that this brief life is everything to us, and death is total, everlasting extinction[17]; once let them thoroughly abandon religion, and who can conceive or describe the extent of the desolation which would follow?



              4. We hope, perhaps, that human laws and natural sympathy would hold society together. As reasonably might we believe that were the sun quenched in the heavens, our torches would illuminate, and our fires quicken and fertilize[18] the creation. What is there in human nature to awaken respect and tenderness, if man is the unprotected insect of a day? And what is he more, if atheism[19] be true?

        5. Erase all thought and fear of God from a community, and selfishness and sensuality[20] would absorb the whole man. Appetite, knowing no restraint, and suffering, having no solace or hope, would trample in scorn on the restraints of human laws. Virtue, duty, principle, would be mocked and spurned as unmeaning sounds. A sordid self-interest would supplant every feeling; and man would become, in fact, what the theory in atheism declares him to be,—a companion for brutes.

        威廉 · 艾勒瑞 · 查宁(1780～1842) ，美国神学家兼演说家，出生于美国罗得岛纽波特。1798年，他以极为优异成绩从哈佛大学毕业，1803年被选为波士顿联邦街教堂牧师，随后一直担任该职务，直到离世。查宁博士生命晚期，身体极度衰弱，他几乎从宗教传道中全身而退，专心致力文学写作，他出版的文集达六卷之多，大多文章涉及神学。





        1．宗教为一种社会关照，就维系社会稳定繁荣来说，宗教通过不同方式对社会影响甚大。宗教不仅为个体信仰，宗教传播更为引起社会公众的高度关注，因为，仁慈与信念才能维持社会秩序的正常运行，而宗教则为其提供最有力的支持。纯真虔诚的宗教旨在行善，显而易见，它所遵循的信条是，假如上帝缔造了社会，上帝是人类朋友，那么，对上帝认知势必强化社会的所有职能，知礼明义的诚信势必为社会公众秩序的坚韧基石。

        2．鲜少有人质疑，或许无人意识到，就维系并推动人类每一善行来说，宗教究竟能走多远；人们可能无从获悉，人类道德与社会感知究竟从宗教精神源头撷取多少营养？假如，不再信奉上帝，人类良心将会变得极度脆弱；如果内心缺乏更为高尚的激励机制甚至维系向善，人类仁爱悲悯将会苟延残喘；社会构建系统无一避免随即产生动荡，从而引发整个系统的可怕崩溃毁灭：即至高无上的存在、责任担当意识，以及对未来生活的祈求展望将从每一个心灵完全抹去。

        3．因此，不妨让人们由衷相信，他们才是向善机缘的实施与推动者，不会有先哲神明关注人类生活，他们所有努力身后已化为灰烬。弱者没有监护人，伤者无法讨还公道，为正义与公众事业奉献牺牲的人无法获取补偿。天空不再听到铿锵誓言，作恶多端者无人为其犯罪指证，人类生存没有目标，人类美德没有始终如一的支持，有信仰的生活对我们来说意味一切，然而死亡最终来临，象征永恒的万劫不归，一旦彻底放弃宗教，谁能想象抑或描述接踵而来孤独寂灭的人类精神荒原？



              4．我们寄望，或许，人类法则和本性悲悯可以促进整个社会凝聚抱团。不妨合乎情理地设想一下，如果天空中太阳最终熄灭，人类火炬能否持久发光？人类光明能否孕育世间万物生长？如果，无神论确实可信，或者人类沦为不受保护的一介虫豸，那么，究竟什么可以唤醒人类本性或心底蛰伏的生命尊重与脉脉温情？



        5．泯灭所有思想，消除社会群体对上帝的敬畏，沉溺于声色犬马的物质享受，整个人类离彻底堕落亦就为期不远。不知自我约束的贪婪欲望，毫无安慰祈盼的逆来顺受，势必轻蔑地践踏人类法律的底线。良好美德、责任担当以及普世原则将任由嘲弄蔑视并随意抛弃，肮脏卑劣地追求自身利益更是肆意剔除每一个体的真实情感，事实上，正如无神论理论公开宣称的，人类无疑终将沦与禽兽为伍。

ROCK ME TO SLEEP


        在摇篮中安睡

        Elizabeth Akers Allen (b. 1832,—d.1911) was born at Strong, Maine, and passed her childhood amidst the picturesque scenery of that neighborhood. She lost her mother when very young, but inherited her grace and delicacy of thought. Shortly after her mother’s death, her father removed to Farmington, Maine, a town noted for its literary people. Mrs. Allen’s early pieces appeared over the pseudonym of “Florence Percy.” Her first verses appeared when she was twelve years old; and her first volume, entitled “Forest Buds from the Woods of Maine,” was Published in 1856. For some years she was assistant editor of the “Portland Transcript.” The following selection was claimed by five different persons, who attempted to steal the honor of its composition.





        1. Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight,

        Make me a child again, just for to-night!

        Mother, come back from the echoless shore,

        Take me again to your heart as of yore;

        Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,

        Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;

        Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;—

        Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!





        2. Backward, flow backward, O tide of the years!

        I am so weary of toil and of tears;

        Toil without recompense, tears all in vain;

        Take them, and give me my childhood again!

        I have grown weary of dust and decay,—

        Weary of flinging my soul wealth away;

        Weary of sowing for others to reap;—

        Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!





        3. Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,

        Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you!

        Many a summer the grass has grown green,

        Blossomed and faded, our faces between:

        Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,

        Long I to-night for your presence again.

        Come from the silence so long and so deep;—

        Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!





              4. Over my heart in the days that are flown,

        No love like mother love ever has shone;

        No other worship abides and endures,

        Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:

        None like a mother can charm away pain

        From the sick soul, and the world-weary brain.

        Slumber’s soft calms o’er my heavy lids creep;—

        Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!





        5. Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,

        Fall on your shoulders again, as of old;

        Let it drop over my forehead to-night,

        Shading my faint eyes away from the light;

        For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,

        Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;

        Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;—

        Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!





        6. Mother, dear mother, the years have been long

        Since I last listened your lullaby song;

        Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem

        Womanhood’s years have been only a dream!

        Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,

        With your light lashes just sweeping my face,

        Never hereafter to wake or to weep;—

        Rock me to sleep, mother,—rock me to sleep!

        1．时光穿梭， 飞快地回到从前，

        今晚星光，我变成可爱孩子，

        妈妈，从无法应答的彼岸归来，

        一如往昔，将我搂抱入怀。



              轻轻地， 她吻着我的前额皱纹，

        随后抚平，我鬓角上初现白发，

        满心怜爱，默默地看我安睡——

        妈妈呵，慢慢荡起摇篮，让我入眠！





        2．时光穿梭， 追溯往昔岁月，

        难以应对， 生活困厄操劳，

        呕心沥血，汗水无法兑现，

        不再忧伤， 今晚我又回到童年！

        滚滚红尘，行尸走肉的皮囊，

        迷惘不安，如何失去信念？

        世事喧嚣，充满尔虞我诈，

        妈妈呵，慢慢荡起摇篮，让我入眠！



        3．我早已，厌倦世俗的虚伪卑鄙，

        哦，妈妈， 我从心底呼唤你！

        夏夜星落， 那片滴翠的草地，

        母女笑容， 跌落在花开花落之间，

        难以抑制， 我多年的思念苦楚，

        哦，妈妈， 渴望你今晚出现。

        回来吧， 你在寂寞黑暗消失很久，

        妈妈呵， 慢慢荡起摇篮，让我入眠！





        4．我的心里， 沉淀往日尘封，

        世界上，没有比母爱更为温柔，

        你毅力坚忍，承受着难言痛苦，

        你耐心开导，教育我豁达快乐，

        你慈祥宽容， 容忍我执拗任性，

        你坦荡无私， 融尽我冥顽冰山。

        你美丽笑容， 成就母亲伟大的包容，

        妈妈呵，慢慢荡起摇篮，让我入眠！





              5．妈妈，垂落你褐色头发，

        阳光下， 金光飘逸地微笑走来，

        你的长发， 今晚能否拂过我的前额，

        为我再次， 遮挡那炫目的光线？

        你的鬓发， 或许随艳阳周边阴影，

        如梦幻觉，再度裹杂甜蜜而来，

        潋滟的光， 那么温馨，扑面清新，

        妈妈呵， 慢慢荡起摇篮，让我入眠！





        6．亲爱的妈妈，多少风雨沧桑走过，

        最后聆听， 你唱起醉人的摇篮曲，

        那缕歌声， 心底萦绕已久，

        尽管我，早已不再年轻！

        光影迷乱， 你以如此方式与我相逢，

        搂紧我， 用一腔浓浓挚爱，

        今生今世， 我不愿醒来，不再哭泣，

        妈妈呵， 慢慢荡起摇篮，让我入眠！





        LESSON 95





MAN AND THE INFERIOR ANIMALS


        人类与动物

        1. The chief difference between man and the other animals consists in this, that the former has reason, whereas the latter have only instinct; but, in order to understand what we mean by the terms reason and instinct, it will be necessary to mention three things in which the difference very distinctly[21] appears.

        2. Let us first, to bring the parties as nearly on a level as possible, consider man in a savage state, wholly occupied, like the beasts of the field, in providing for the wants of his animal nature; and here the first distinction that appears between them is the use of implements[22]. When the savage provides himself with a hut or a wigwam[23] for shelter, or that he may store up his provisions, he does no more than is done by the rabbit, the beaver, the bee, and birds of every species.

        3. But the man can not make any progress in this work without tools; he must provide himself with an ax even before he can cut down a tree for its timber; whereas these animals form their burrows[24], their cells, or their nests, with no other tools than those with which nature has provided them. In cultivating the ground, also, man can do nothing without a spade or a plow; nor can he reap what he has sown till he has shaped an implement with which to cut clown his harvest. But the inferior animals provide for themselves and their young without any of these things.

        4. Now for the second distinction. Man, in all his operations, makes mistakes; animals make none. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a bird sitting on a twig lamenting over her half-finished nest and puzzling her little head to know how to complete it? Or did you ever see the cells of a beehive in clumsy, irregular shapes, or observe anything like a discussion[25] in the little community, as if there were a difference of opinion among the architects?

        5. The lower animals are even better physicians than we are; for when they are ill, they will, many of them, seek out some particular herb, which they do not, use as food, and which possesses a medicinal[26] quality exactly suited to the complaint; whereas, the whole college of physicians will dispute for a century about the virtues of a single drug.

        6. Man undertakes nothing in which he is not more or less puzzled; and must try numberless experiments before he can bring his undertakings to anything like perfection; even the simplest operations of domestic life are not well performed without some experience; and the term of man’s life is half wasted before he has done with his mistakes and begins to profit by his lessons.



              7. The third distinction is that animals make no improvements; while the knowledge, and skill, and the success of man are perpetually on the increase. Animals, in all their operations, follow the first impulse of nature or that instinct which God has implanted in them. In all they do undertake, therefore, their works are more perfect and regular than those of man.

        8. But man, having been endowed[27] with the faculty[28] of thinking or reasoning about what he does, is enabled by patience and industry to correct the mistakes into which he at first falls, and to go on constantly improving. A bird’s nest is, indeed, a perfect structure; yet the nest of a swallow of the nineteenth century is not at all more commodious or elegant than those that were built amid the rafters of Noah’s ark. But if we compare the wigwam of the savage with the temples and palaces of ancient Greece and Rome, we then shall see to what man’s mistakes, rectified[29] and improved upon, conduct him.





        9. “When the vast sun shall veil his golden light

        Deep in the gloom of everlasting night;

        When wild, destructive flames shall wrap the skies,

        When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies;

        Man shall alone the wreck of worlds survive;

        ’Mid falling spheres, immortal man shall live.”

        —Jane Taylor.

        1．人类与动物区别在于：前者具有理性，而后者唯有本能，不过为了弄清我们所说的理性与本能的定义，在此，有必要阐述三点人与动物之间的显见差异。

        2．首先，让我们将人类与动物尽可能置于同一范畴比较，与兽类雷同，完全处于野蛮状态下的人类，就动物生存性需要而言，人类与动物无异；这里，人类与动物关键差异在于工具的使用。当原始人出于自身考虑，搭建茅舍或者棚屋以遮风避雨，甚至存贮食物，其实，人类行为绝非具有超越野兔、海狸、蜜蜂或任何鸟类的本能意义。

        3．如果没有工具，在原始生存环境下，人类不会获取任何进步；当原始人为获取木头而砍伐树木前，他必须准备刀斧之类工具；而动物打算挖建洞穴、筑造蜂巢、或垒搭鸟窝，无法利用自然界物件造出可供自己使用的工具。如果没有木锹或铧犁，人类无法耕作或翻整土地；甚而无法收获播种的庄稼，除非他事先做出某种可以收割庄稼的工具。然而，低级动物无法为自己或后代制造任何劳动工具。



              4．现在，我们来谈谈第二个差异。就人类行为举止而言，凡夫俗子错误在所难免；而动物不会犯错误。你是否听说栖息树枝上的小鸟哀叹自己尚未完工的巢穴，或是不知所措怎样将巢穴建好？你是否观察过那些拙笨、不规则的蜂房巢室，是否留意在筑造蜂巢时，蜜蜂群体成员存在不同意见从而进行讨论？

        5．与人类相比，低级动物不愧是更好的医生。动物生病时，它们大多寻找某些特殊药草，这类药草并非食用，而是专门用作治病养伤，并且确实具有某种药物疗效；相反，就医用疗效来说，哪怕一种药物，整个医学院专家医生们完全可以喋喋不休地辩论上百年。

        6．人类做事总喜欢瞻前顾后，他必须无数次躬身亲为，试图将事情做到近乎完善，然而，哪怕最简单的家庭生活缺乏实践，他亦无法做到称心如意。人类初涉某一事物，错误过失在所难免，每每开始从自身经验教训里终有所得，他的人生时光早已挥霍过半。

        7．人类与动物的第三点差异在于：动物本身绝不存在任何改进或进步；而人类知识、技能以及成功终将不断地推进自己完善。大凡动物的行为举止，不过遵循生物的最初欲望或上帝嵌入生物的不同本能需求。因此，不管它们从事任何事情，其结果总会比人类所做的更为有序完美。

        8．然而，由于其行为举止被赋予思考与推理的能力，人类通过耐心勤奋可以纠正最初错误，并且不断地加以调整。的确，一只鸟窝构造完美，但十九世纪燕子的巢穴完全不会比用椽木建造的诺亚方舟更为舒适漂亮。不过，当我们将原始人窝棚与古希腊或古罗马的庙宇宫殿进行比较，我们不难看出，一个持续绵延的纠偏改进过程，引导人类走向完美。

        9．“当庞大太阳收敛金色阳光，

         世界进入永恒无边的黑夜，

         毁灭火焰呼啸着卷过天空，

         到处在坍塌，自然走向濒亡，

         目睹无数星体纷纷坠落消逝，

         人类在宇宙残骸中孤独伫立。”

THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT


        盲人摸象

        John Godfrey Saxe (b. 1816, d.1887), an American humorist, lawyer, and journalist, was born at Highgate, Vt. He graduated at Middlebury College in 1839; was admitted to the bar in 1843; and practiced law until 1850, when he became editor of the “Burlington Sentinel.” In 1851, he was elected State’s attorney. “Progress, a Satire, and Other Poems,” his first volume, was published in 1849, and several other volumes of great merit attest his originality. For genial humor and good-natured satire, Saxe’s writings rank among the best of their kind, and are very popular.





        1. It was six men of Indostan,

        To learning much inclined,

        Who went to see the elephant,

        (Though all of them were blind,)

        That each by observation

        Might satisfy his mind.





        2. The first approached the elephant,

        And, happening to fall

        Against his broad and sturdy side,

        At once began to bawl:

        “God bless me! but the elephant

        Is very like a wall!”





        3. The second, feeling of the tusk,

        Cried: “Ha! what have we here,

        So very round, and smooth, and sharp?

        To me ’t is very clear,

        This wonder of an elephant

        Is very like a spear!”





        4. The third approached the animal,

        And, happening to take

        The squirming trunk within his hands,

        Thus boldly up he spake:

        “I see,” quoth he, “the elephant

        Is very like a snake!”



              5. The fourth reached out his eager hand,

        And fell about the knee:

        “What most this wondrous beast is like,

        Is very plain,” quoth he;

        “ ’T is clear enough the elephant

        Is very like a tree!”





        6. The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,

        Said: “E’en the blindest man

        Can tell what this resembles most:

        Deny the fact who can,

        This marvel of an elephant

        Is very like a fan!”





        7. The sixth no sooner had begun

        About the beast to grope,

        Than, seizing on the swinging tail

        That fell within his scope,

        “I see,” quoth he, “the elephant

        Is very like a rope!”





        8. And so these men of Indostan

        Disputed loud and long,

        Each in his own opinion

        Exceeding stiff and strong,

        Though each was partly in the right,

        And all were in the wrong!

        1. 从前，有六个印度人，

        他们想了解外面世界，

        于是，相约一起去看大象，

         （虽然，他们都是盲人，）

        每人都想通过自己的触觉，

        满足抑制不住的好奇心。



              2. 第一个盲人，走上前，

        碰巧摸到，大象宽厚的腹部，

        他立刻，朗声叫道：

         “我的天呀！这大象，

        它，确实像是一堵墙！”





        3. 第二个盲人，抱住象牙，

        他也随即高喊：“哈！

        原来这又圆、又滑、尖尖的，

        今天，我终于明白，

        这只大象，不过是支长矛。”





        4. 第三个盲人走上前，没想到，

        竟然抓到，大象扭动的长鼻，

        于是，兴奋异常地叫唤，

        “我看呀，这，这大象

         好像，一条粗长的蟒蛇！”





        5. 第四位盲人，性子忒急，

        急不可耐中，他伸出双手，

        猛然间，摸到大象的粗腿，

        忙不迭地高声反驳，“所有这些，

        再清楚不过，这只大象，

        想必，你们应该明白，

        与大树，肯定分毫不差。”





        6. 接下来，第五人凑巧拽住

        大象的耳朵，“哪怕最瞎的人，

        也能知道，大象的明显特征，

        你们怎能，罔顾事实说话，

        至于，这头大象的样子，

        它压根嘛，就像一把蒲扇。



              7. 第六个盲人，迈步过来，

        伸手一把，突然抓到

        空中晃悠的，大象尾巴，

        他仔细摸索一番，开口叫喊，

        “我清楚了，大象呀，

        太像是，一条细长的绳子。”





        8. 可怜，那六位印度盲人，

        针尖麦芒，长时间争吵不停，

        他们愚蠢固执，坚信不疑，

        谁都认为，自己完全正确，

        尽管， 每人描述的细节不错，

        但那狭隘眼光，徒留世人笑话！





        LESSON 97





A HOME SCENE


        家庭场景

        Donald Grant Mitchell (b. 1822,—d.1908). This popular American writer was born in Norwich, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1841. In 1844 he went to England, and, after traveling through that country on foot, spent some time on the continent. His first volume, “Fresh Gleanings, or a New Sheaf from the Old Fields of Continental Europe, by Ik Marvel,” was published in 1847, soon after his return home. He revisited Europe in 1848. On his return, he published “The Battle Summer.” Mr. Mitchell has contributed to the “Knickerbocker Magazine,” the “Atlantic Monthly,” and several agricultural journals. His most popular works are “The Reveries of a Bachelor,” 1850, and “Dream Life,” 1851. Besides these, he has written “My Farm of Edgewood,” “Wet Days at Edgewood,” “Doctor Johns,” a novel “Rural Studies,” and other works. He is a charming writer. In 1853 he was appointed United States consul at Venice. In 1855 he settled on a farm near New Haven, Conn., where he now resides. The following selection is from “Dream Life.”





        1. Little does the boy know, as the tide of years drifts by, floating him out insensibly from the harbor of his home, upon the great sea of life,—what joys, what opportunities, what affections, are slipping from him into the shades of that inexorable[30] Past, where no man can go, save on the wings of his dreams.

        2. Little does he think, as he leans upon the lap of his mother, with his eye turned to her, in some earnest pleading for a fancied pleasure of the hour, or in some important story of his griefs, that such sharing of his sorrows, and such sympathy with his wishes, he will find nowhere again.

        3. Little does he imagine that the fond sister Nelly, ever thoughtful of his pleasures, ever smiling away his griefs, will soon be beyond the reach of either; and that the waves of the years which come rocking so gently under him will soon toss her far away, upon the great swell of life.

        4. But now, you are there. The fire light glimmers upon the walls of your cherished home. The big chair of your father is drawn to its wonted[31] corner by the chimney side; his head, just touched with gray, lies back upon its oaken top. Opposite sits your mother: her figure is thin, her look cheerful, yet subdued;—her arm perhaps resting on your shoulder, as she talks to you in tones of tender admonition[32], of the days that are to come.

        5. The cat is purring on the hearth; the clock that ticked so plainly when Charlie died is ticking on the mantel still. The great table in the middle of the room, with its books and work, waits only for the lighting of the evening lamp, to see a return to its stores of embroidery and of story.



              6. Upon a little stand under the mirror, which catches now and then a flicker of the fire light, and makes it play, as if in wanton, upon the ceiling, lies that big book, reverenced of your New England parents—the Family Bible. It is a ponderous[33], square volume, with heavy silver clasps, that you have often pressed open for a look at its quaint[34], old pictures, for a study of those prettily bordered pages, which lie between the Testaments, and which hold the Family Record.

        7. There are the Births;—your father’s and your mother’s; it seems as if they were born a long time ago; and even your own date of birth appears an almost incredible[35] distance back. Then there are the Marriages;—only one as yet; and your mother’s name looks oddly to you: it is hard to think of her as anyone else than your doting [36]parent.

        8. Last of all come the Deaths;—only one. Poor Charlie! How it looks!—“ Died, 12 September, 18—, Charles Henry, aged four years.” You know just how it looks. You have turned to it often; there you seem to be joined to him, though only by the turning of a leaf.

        9. And over your thoughts, as you look at that page of the Record, there sometimes wanders a vague[37], shadowy fear, which will come,—that your own name may soon be there. You try to drop the notion, as if it were not fairly your own; you affect to slight it, as you would slight a boy who presumed[38] on your acquaintance, but whom you have no desire to know.

        10. Yet your mother—how strange it is!—has no fears of such dark fancies. Even now, as you stand beside her, and as the twilight deepens in the room, her low, silvery voice is stealing upon your ear, telling you that she can not be long with you;—that the time is coming, when you must be guided by your own judgment, and struggle with the world unaided by the friends of your boyhood.

        11. There is a little pride, and a great deal more of anxiety, in your thoughts now, as you look steadfastly into the home blaze, while those delicate fingers, so tender of your happiness, play with the locks upon your brow. To struggle with the world,—that is a proud thing; to struggle alone,—there lies the doubt! Then crowds in swift upon the calm of boyhood the first anxious thought of youth.

        12. The hands of the old clock upon the mantel that ticked off the hours when Charlie sighed and when Charlie died, draw on toward midnight. The shadows that the fireflame makes grow dimmer and dimmer. And thus it is, that Home,—boy home, passes away forever,—like the swaying of a pendulum,—like the fading of a shadow on the floor.

        1．男孩很少知道，随着岁月潮水的流逝，不知不觉间，他已从家乡的港口离开，驶入生活的浩瀚海洋。所有快乐、机遇和钟情正在悄然溜走，宛如进入无法改变的过去，除非展开梦幻的双翼，没有任何人能够抵达那一深邃时光。

        2．男孩很少想到，当他倚靠在母亲身边，眼巴巴地望着母亲，急切地恳求母亲为他讲述精彩虚幻的岁月，或者哀怨难过的故事，那些故事里流泻出他的忧愁感伤，寄寓了他的美好愿景，在母亲娓娓动听的故事里，他再次发现无路可逃。

        3．男孩很少考虑，那位可爱的耐莉妹妹对他那么体贴备至，总是笑语盈盈地化解他的哀愁。然而，不久两人便渐离渐远。曾经在他心底激起的温柔涟漪，时光旋即那个美丽身影远远抛开，他不得不面对现实的无端残酷。

        4．现在，你又回到家乡。心里珍藏的家舍墙壁上火光闪烁，父亲那把宽大椅子依旧摆放在烟囱边往日角落，他的头倚靠在座椅的橡木椅顶，已是发须皆白。母亲坐在对面，她身材瘦削，神色开心，笑得有点儿勉强，或许她的胳膊搭在你的肩上，一边轻声叮咛，嘱你不要荒废时日的家常道理。

        5．猫咪在灶台上打着呼噜，沉寂的壁炉架上那台挂钟滴答走着，一如既往地走着，与查理死时毫无两样。房间中央的那张大桌上摆摞着书籍及物件，默默等待夜晚降临的灯光。唯有置身在这熟悉的光影流泻里，才能恍然依稀回到昔日尘嚣。

        6．一个矮小身影站着镜子下，眼光不时荒唐地追逐镜面里亮光闪烁，那团映射到天花板上的摇曳火苗，曾是你自寻其乐的玩耍；翻动家庭《圣经》，那本迁居新大陆后父母敬畏的经书。那本圣经笨重，方形版面装帧，配有厚实的银色搭扣，你经常将大书轻轻摊开，饶有兴致地翻阅书中趣闻，浏览那些古老泛黄的画面，好奇地琢磨镶有彩框的书页，镶嵌在整套《新约全书》中的彩色插图，以及家族传承的相关记载。

        7．上面记录着家族成员的出生日期——包括你父母诞日，他们来到这个世界的日子仿佛那么久远，接着你又找到自己生辰，几乎难以相信的遥远昨天。书中还记有家庭婚姻——不过仅仅一次，母亲名字在你眼里显得颇为古怪，除去那副极为慈爱的面孔，很难想象母亲的其他模样。



              8．所有人最终都离开了这个世界，唯独一人属于非正常死亡，可怜的查理！这究竟怎么回事？家庭圣经里记载：“查理•亨利卒于18××年，9月12日，时年4岁。”你只知道世事无常，当年还时常翻动那本《圣经》，不过轻轻将书翻动一页，似乎也随早殇的查理而去。

        9．翻阅浏览着家庭记载，你的思绪翻腾不安，模糊可怖的阴影不时无端闯入——很快，你的名字将会赫然出现在那本书上。你试图挥去那团荒谬念头，好像那完全不是你的真实想法，你假装不去想那满心惊悚，好像路上走来个孩子，与你套近乎说是你的熟人，而你压根不动声色。

        10．可是，你的妈妈，看来不可思议！你好像丝毫没有黑暗虚妄的恐惧。即便现在，暮色使房间更为昏暗，你伫立她的身边，她那银铃般声音轻轻在你耳边响起，她告诉你，不能长久与你生活一起，离别的时刻已经来临，今后闯荡社会只能依靠你自己判断，独自一人在这个世界打拼，别再指望孩提时代所有的外来肩膀。

        11．你目光坚毅地看着家里壁炉里恍惚光焰，思绪万千的心里或许存有些许骄傲，更多的则是忧虑。那些精致手指打开了你眉间心结，你的幸福刹那间变得旖旎温柔。在世打拼，毕竟引以为豪；独自一人打拼，困惑不安郁闷！青春时代第一次忧心忡忡，就这样急遽闯入童年的静穆安宁。

        12．查理在叹息，查理已死去，壁炉架上古老壁钟仍然滴答不停，时针现在指向午夜。炉火阴影变得愈加黯淡，模糊不清。这就是家，男孩的家，永远消逝不再的家，好像钟摆不停摇动中，地面阴影随之一点点烟消云散。

THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS


        昔日的光辉

        Thomas Moore (b. 1779. d. 1852) was born in Dublin, Ireland, and he was educated at Trinity College in that city. In 1799, he entered the Middle Temple, London, as a student of law. Soon after the publication of his first poetical productions, he was sent to Bermuda in an official capacity. He subsequently visited the United States. Moore’s most famous works are: “Lalla Rookh,” an Oriental romance, 1817; “The Loves of the Angels,” 1823; and “Irish Melodies,” 1834; a “Life of Lord Byron,” and “The Epicurean, an Eastern Tale.” “Moore’s excellencies,” says Dr. Angus, “consist in the gracefulness of his thoughts, the wit and fancy of his allusions and imagery, and the music and refinement of his versification.”





        1. Oft in the stilly night

        Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,

        Fond memory brings the light

        Of other days around me:

         The smiles, the tears

         Of boyhood’s years,

        The words of love then spoken;

         The eyes that shone,

         Now dimmed and gone,

        The cheerful hearts now broken!

        Thus in the stilly night

         Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,

        Sad memory brings the light

        Of other days around me.





        2. When I remember all

        The friends so linked together

        I’ve seen around me fall

         Like leaves in wintry weather,

         I feel like one

         Who treads alone

         Some banquet hall deserted,

         Whose lights are fled

         Whose garlands dead,

        And all but he departed.

        Thus in the stilly night

         Ere slumber’s chain has bound me,



              Sad memory brings the light

        Of other days around me.

        1．大地融入万籁寂静，

        夜半灯火辗转难眠，

        美好眷念泛起温馨，

        孩提往事幕幕浮现。

        追溯以往悲情难抑，

        天真笑语眼泪在飞，

        难以启口温情脉脉，

        海誓山盟爱意缠绵，

        光影黯淡青涩走远，

        肝胆欲裂知音何处？

        大地融入万籁寂静，

        夜半灯火辗转难眠，

        欢乐悲哀镌刻心间，

        历历在目难以复现。





        2．昔日如梦呼啸闪回，

        把盏唤友激情岁月，

        知心伙伴渐次离去，

        萧瑟寒冬风起落叶，

        如今唯有孑身一人，

        形单影只凄凉难奈，



              盛装舞会兀自嗟叹，

        谁的青春年华流逝？

        谁的花朵芬芳凋谢？

         唯我依然苟存于世，

        孤独徜徉红尘世间，

        夜半灯火辗转难眠，

        往事如歌沧桑难诉，

        天高地阔回眸走远。





        LESSON 99





A CHASE IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL


        英吉利海峡追逐战

        James Fenimore Cooper (b. 1789, d. 1851). This celebrated American novelist was born in Burlington, N.J. His father removed to the state of New York about 1790, and founded Cooperstown, on Otsego Lake. He studied three years at Yale, and then entered the navy as a common sailor. He became a midshipman in 1806, and was afterwards promoted to the rank of lieutenant; but he left the service in 1811. His first novel, “Precaution,” was published in 1819; his best work, “The Spy,” a tale of the Revolutionary War, in 1821. The success of “The Spy” was almost unprecedented, and its author at once took rank among the most popular writers of the day. “The Pilot” and “The Red Rover” are considered his best sea novels. “The Pioneers,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” “The Prairie,” “The Pathfinder,” and “The Deerslayer” are among the best of his tales of frontier life. The best of his novels have been translated into nearly all of the European languages, and into some of those of Asia. “The creations of his genius,” says Bryant, “shall survive through centuries to come, and only perish with our language.” The following selection is from “The Pilot.”

        1. The ship which the American frigate[39] had now to oppose, was a vessel of near her own size and equipage[40]; and when Griffith looked at her again, he perceived that she had made her preparations to assert her equality in manful fight.

        2. Her sails had been gradually reduced to the usual quantity, and, by certain movements on her decks, the lieutenant and his constant attendant, the Pilot, well understood that she only wanted to lessen the distance a few hundred yards to begin the action.

        “Now spread everything,” whispered the stranger.

        3. Griffith applied the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted, in a voice that was carried even to his enemy, “Let fall—out with your booms—sheet home—hoist away of everything!”

        4. The inspiring cry was answered by a universal bustle. Fifty men flew out on the dizzy heights of the different spars, while broad sheets of canvas rose as suddenly along the masts, as if some mighty bird were spreading its wings. The Englishman instantly perceived his mistake, and he answered the artifice[41] by a roar of artillery. Griffith watched the effects of the broadside[42] with an absorbing interest as the shot whistled above his head; but when he perceived his masts untouched, and the few unimportant ropes, only, that were cut, he replied to the uproar with a burst of pleasure.



              5. A few men were, however, seen clinging with wild frenzy to the cordage, dropping from rope to rope, like wounded birds fluttering through a tree, until they fell heavily into the ocean, the sullen ship sweeping by them in a cold indifference. At the next instant, the spars and masts of their enemy exhibited a display of men similar to their own, when Griffith again placed the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted aloud, “Give it to them; drive them from their yards, boys; scatter them with your grape; unreeve their rigging!”

        6. The crew of the American wanted but little encouragement to enter on this experiment with hearty good will, and the close of his cheering words was uttered amid the deafening roar of his own cannon. The Pilot had, however, mistaken the skill and readiness of their foe; for, notwithstanding the disadvantageous circumstances under which the Englishman increased his sail, the duty was steadily and dexterously performed.

        7. The two ships were now running rapidly on parallel lines, hurling at each other their instruments of destruction with furious industry, and with severe and certain loss to both, though with no manifest[43] advantage in favor of either. Both Griffith and the Pilot witnessed, with deep concern, this unexpected defeat of their hopes; for they could not conceal from themselves that each moment lessened their velocity through the water, as the shot of the enemy stripped the canvas from the yards, or dashed aside the lighter spars in their terrible progress.

        8. “We find our equal here,” said Griffith to the stranger. “The ninety is heaving up again like a mountain; and if we continue to shorten sail at this rate, she will soon be down upon us!”

        “You say true, sir,” returned the Pilot, musing, “the man shows judgment as well as spirit; but—”

        9. He was interrupted by Merry, who rushed from the forward part of the vessel, his whole face betokening the eagerness of his spirit and the importance of his intelligence.—

        “The breakers!” he cried, when nigh enough to be heard amid the din; “we are running dead on a ripple, and the sea is white not two hundred yards ahead.”

        10. The Pilot jumped on a gun, and, bending to catch a glimpse through the smoke, he shouted, in those clear, piercing tones, that could be even heard among the roaring of the cannon,—

        “Port, port your helm! we are on the Devil’s Grip! Pass up the trumpet, sir; port your helm, fellow; give it to them, boys—give it to the proud English dogs!”

        11. Griffith unhesitatingly relinquished the symbol of his rank, fastening his own firm look on the calm but quick eye of the Pilot, and gathering assurance[44] from the high confidence he read in the countenance of the stranger. The seamen were too busy with their cannon and the rigging to regard the new danger; and the frigate entered one of the dangerous passes of the shoals, in the heat of a severely contested battle.

        12. The wondering looks of a few of the older sailors glanced at the sheets of foam that flew by them, in doubt whether the wild gambols of the waves were occasioned by the shot of the enemy, when suddenly the noise of cannon was succeeded by the sullen wash of the disturbed element, and presently the vessel glided out of her smoky shroud, and was boldly steering in the center of the narrow passages.



              13. For ten breathless minutes longer the Pilot continued to hold an uninterrupted sway[45], during which the vessel ran swiftly by ripples and breakers, by streaks of foam and darker passages of deep water, when he threw down his trumpet and exclaimed—

        “What threatened to be our destruction has proved our salvation.—Keep yonder hill crowned with wood one point open from the church tower at its base, and steer east and by north; you will run through these shoals on that course in an hour, and by so doing you will gain five leagues of your enemy, who will have to double their trail.”

        14. Every officer in the ship, after the breathless suspense of uncertainty had passed, rushed to those places where a view might be taken of their enemies. The ninety was still steering boldly onward, and had already approached the two thirds, which lay a helpless wreck, rolling on the unruly seas that were rudely tossing her on their wanton billows. The frigate last engaged was running along the edge of the ripple, with her torn sails flying loosely in the air, her ragged spars tottering in the breeze, and everything above her hull exhibiting the confusion of a sudden and unlooked-for check to her progress.

        15. The exulting taunts and mirthful congratulations of the seamen, as they gazed at the English ships, were, however, soon forgotten in the attention that was required to their own vessel. The drums beat the retreat, the guns were lashed, the wounded again removed, and every individual able to keep the deck was required to lend his assistance in repairing the damages to the frigate, and securing her masts.

        16. The promised hour carried the ship safely through all the dangers, which were much lessened by daylight; and by the time the sun had begun to fall over the land, Griffith, who had not quitted the deck during the day, beheld his vessel once more cleared of the confusion of the chase and battle, and ready to meet another foe.

        詹姆士 · 费尼莫尔 · 库珀(1789～1851)，这位著名的美国小说家出生于美国新泽西州伯林顿。大约在18世纪90年代，他的父亲举家搬迁到纽约州，在奥特希哥湖畔创办了库珀斯敦镇。库珀在耶鲁大学学习3年后，作为一位普通水手进入海军服役。1806年，他成为一名见习船员，后提升为中尉，然而他于1811年退役。1819年，他的首部小说《百般提防》出版；1821年，他的最好作品《间谍》问世，那是，一篇描述独立战争的小说；《间谍》续集极为精彩，几乎无与伦比，库珀很快便被推崇为当时最负声望的作家。他的《领航员》与《红罗孚》被公认为他最优异的海洋题材小说；《先驱者》、《最后的莫西干人》、《大草原》，《开拓者》与《猎鹿人》则为他边陲题材的优秀作品。他的优秀小说几乎翻译成欧洲所有语言推出，其中一些被译成亚洲语言出版。布莱恩特做出如此评价：“库珀的天才创造，将会穿越数百年时光，陪伴我们的语言留世珍藏。”以下段落来自他的《领航员》。





        1．这艘美国防卫舰此刻的对手，为一艘与其体积配置所差无几的英国战舰，格里菲斯船长再度打量了自己舰艇，意识到准备工作已经就绪，完全可以投入即将到来的激烈战斗。



              2．护卫舰航行速度缓慢地减到正常时速后，随同一直左右的领航员，上尉船长登上甲板观察后发现，只要将两舰距离减少数百码，便可即刻发动攻击。

        “进入战斗状态，”那位新来的领航员低声说道。

        3．格里菲斯船长扬起喇叭，他的声音洪亮，在空中炸响，甚至敌舰亦能听见，“士兵们，各就各位投入战斗，做好炮击准备，立即升起风帆！”

        4．船舰上顿时一团喧嚣忙乱。五十位军人如离弦的箭般飞奔爬向高低不同的大小桅杆，数张宽阔的船帆顷刻间沿着桅杆嗖嗖地升起展开，宛如巨鸟霎时打开宽阔双翼。英国人旋即意识到自己的失策，很快用一通轰鸣火炮回应美舰的袭击。当炮弹呼啸着从格里菲斯头顶掠过，船长急切地察看隆隆炮声后的船舷，防卫舰上所有桅杆毫发无伤，不过只是炸断几根不甚紧要的绳索，他的心头不禁泛起一阵狂喜。

        5．然而，就在那时，桅杆上端有几位水兵拼命想抓住绳索，却接二连三地急遽掉落，“嘭”“嘭”地重重地摔进大海，犹如受伤鸟儿胡乱拍打颤抖的双翼，从树丛高处跌落下来，尽管满腔掠过不悦的神情，但官兵们只能束手无策。紧接着，敌舰甲板的桅杆上亦有士兵陆续掉进海里，重复再现美舰甲板上的场景。这时，格里菲斯船长再次拿起喇叭高声叫喊，“士兵们！开始炮击！将敌人从桅杆上轰下来！连续炮击，炸掉他们的桅杆！咬死他们！”

        6．微不足道的战场煽情，一丁点由衷的热切鼓励，美军防卫舰上士兵们顿时群情激奋，勇气倍增，船长激昂的话音未落，全船随即淹没在舰船发出一连串震耳欲聋的炮声轰鸣。然而，敌舰迅速敏捷的应变能力，还是超出了领航员的估计与判断，尽管面对英国人加大航速的不利局面，美军防卫舰并未乱了阵脚，船舰仍然正常有序行进。

        7．两艘战舰互为平行地快速行驶，双方猛烈地互相开炮攻击，短兵相接，炸弹纷飞，交火双方损失惨重，但尚未有任何一方明显占有上风。格里菲斯与领航员忧心忡忡地望着两舰惨烈厮杀，这场未曾料想的海上激战使他们原以为胜劵在握的希望落空，因为敌方炮火猛烈，疯狂肆虐的轮番进攻，倾泻不断的炮火，接二连三地炸断防卫舰甲板桅杆，造成多处桅杆毁损严重，船长和领航员清醒地意识到，乘风破浪中的防卫舰速度愈来愈慢。

        8．“我们遇到对手了，”格里菲斯船长对新来的领航员说，“九十根桅杆重新拉好了，风帆立起像座山；如果我们仍以目前速率持续减速，英国战舰会嘲笑我们的！”



        “说得不错，先生，”领航员回答，内心暗自思忖，“船长眼光敏锐，犹如神助，但是——”

         9．领航员思绪突然被打断，原来，水手梅里从船的前舷飞跑过来，满脸焦急万分，像有重大事情要报。

        “船，就要搁浅了！”他高声喊叫着，即使在两舰对决的炮火纷飞中，梅里的话依然清晰真切地在空中炸响，“我们身陷绝境，前方不到两百码已见大片滩涂。”





              10．领航员迅速爬上炮管，透过浓密的炮火硝烟，躬身往前仔细察看，不过迅速瞥看一眼，他随即高喊起来，如此尖利刺耳的声音，在炮声轰鸣中愈发瘆人。



        “快，左满舵！左满舵！我们马上就要玩完了。船长先生，请把喇叭递给我，伙计，劳驾，左满舵！快点！让英国佬撞上去，让那些英国猪去死吧！”

        11．格里菲斯船长毫不犹豫地将他权力象征的喇叭递给领航员，一个目光坚毅，一个冷静急切，双方刹那间眼神在对视交流，格里菲斯觉得内心力量的聚集，从那个陌生的面容上，他清楚地看到力挽狂澜以拯救全船危难的坚定信心。此刻甲板上忙乱成团，有的水兵在发射炮弹，有的在桅杆上扯拉风帆索具，在战事最为白热化阶段，水兵们全然不知美军防卫舰已驶入最危险的滩涂地带，一场灭顶之灾咫尺之遥。

        12．炮声间隙中，突然船底水流清晰不安的冲刷声，让几位老水手好生疑惑，他们匆忙中发现，军舰疾驶过的水域几乎无法激起涌浪，不由心中疑惑，是否敌舰炮弹造成海浪的消失？此刻，炮声歇息了但海浪的冲刷声令人令严躁不安。不一会，军舰悄悄地驶出那片烟雾缭绕、充满裹尸布气息的恐怖海域，终于，在那条极为狭窄的通道中勇敢地转舵成功。

        13．十分钟窒息时光，似乎如此漫长，领航员冷静沉着地指挥，军舰迅速地转向，一路上浪花不惊，危机四伏，渐渐地浪花变大，最后驶入海水颜色渐深的海域，领航员突然扔下喇叭，发出大声尖叫，说，“拯救顺利啦！我们终于将要摆脱死亡的魔爪！注意那边林木茂密的山顶，就是那处冒出教堂塔尖的地方，注意转舵，保持朝东偏北的航线方向，一小时后，我们就能穿过这片危险的滩涂地带。这样看来，我舰就会比敌舰快五海里，他们路程肯定会增倍。”

        14.船上官兵人人无不屏住呼吸，等到熬过这段艰险万分的航程后，大家纷纷冲到最佳位置，寻找可以清楚看清敌舰方位的地方。此时，载有九十人的军舰勇猛地转舵向前，劈风斩浪，安全驶过差不多三分之二的航程，包括那片可怕的搁浅滩。浪花汹涌翻腾扑来，防卫舰剧烈地颠簸不停，舰艇最终抵达深海边缘。放眼望去，猎猎飞舞的船帆支离破碎，多处断裂的桅杆在微风中摇摆晃荡，甲板上一片悲惨狼藉。所有这些，无不显示一场突如其来、无法预料的战事如此惨烈不堪。



        15.望着远方的英国舰队，防卫舰官兵们的欢声笑语夹杂诙谐逗乐在整个甲板响起，但好景不长，战鼓已擂起撤退令，枪炮很快悉数收起，伤痛将再度消除；每位官兵将迅速投身到战事给舰艇造成损伤的紧张修复中，以确保船上桅杆等相关设施安全无虞。

        16.满怀希望之光，伴随战舰驶过危难重重的征途，美军防卫舰终于迎来了温馨黎明，明媚阳光荡除了死亡阴霾，整整一天中，格里菲斯船长没有从甲板上退下。此刻的他，看着他可爱战舰从恐怖危险中冲出到得以弥合战斗创伤；从激烈追逐的战场到安全返航；英勇的战舰将再度焕发新生，准备迎接下一场激烈战斗。





        LESSON 100





BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE


        约翰·摩尔先生的葬礼

        Charles Wolfe (b. 1791, d. 1823), an Irish poet and clergyman, was born in Dublin. He was educated in several schools, and graduated at the university of his native city. He was ordained in 1817, and soon became noted for his zeal and energy as a clergyman. His literary productions were collected and published in 1825. “The Burial of Sir John Moore,” one of the finest poems of its kind in the English language, was written in 1817, and first appeared in the “Newry Telegraph,” a newspaper, with the author’s initials, but without his knowledge. Byron said of this ballad that he would rather be the author of it than of any one ever written.





        1. Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,

        As his corse to the rampart we hurried;

        Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot

        O’er the grave where our hero we buried.





        2. We buried him darkly, at dead of night,

        The sods with our bayonets turning,

        By the struggling moonbeam’s misty light,

        And the lantern dimly burning.





        3. No useless coffin inclosed his breast,

        Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him;

        But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,

        With his martial[46] cloak around him.





        4. Few and short were the prayers we said,

        And we spoke not a word of sorrow;

        But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead

        And we bitterly thought of the morrow.





        5. We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,

        And smoothed down his lonely pillow,

        That the foe and the stranger would tread o’er his head,

        And we far away on the billow!





              6. Lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone

        And o’er his cold ashes upbraid[47] him;

        But little he’ll reck[48], if they’ll let him sleep on

        In a grave where a Briton has laid him.





        7. But half of our heavy task was done,

        When the clock struck the hour for retiring

        And we heard the distant random[49] gun

        That the foe was sullenly firing.





        8. Slowly and sadly we laid him down,

        From the field of his fame, fresh and gory;

        We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,

        But we left him alone with his glory!

        查尔斯 · 沃尔夫(1791～1823年)，爱尔兰诗人和牧师，出生于都伯林。在数处学校接受教育，毕业于都伯林当地大学。1817年，沃尔夫被任命为牧师，不久便以热情与能力声名鹊起，1825年，他的文学作品集辑出版。1817年，他开始用英语写作《约翰 · 摩尔先生的葬礼》，该篇为英文同类诗歌题材中上乘之作，最早登载于《钮里电讯》报上；尽管报纸刊有作者姓名的首字母，却并未关于作者的只言片语介绍。拜伦在谈到这首诗作时说，他但愿自己能写出如此不朽之作，与其相比，其他诗歌只会黯然失色。





        1.没有鼓鸣，没有葬礼哀乐，

         我们匆忙地，将战友掩埋，

         没有枪声，送行英雄，

         我们悲哀地，告别兄弟。





        2.夜幕嗅出， 死亡阴森气息，

         草地上， 刺刀寒光凛凛，

         惨白月光下， 身影憧憧，

         送葬马灯， 鬼火忽暗忽明。





              3.长眠兹此，甚至没有棺冢，

         亦没有， 最后送终敛衣；

         那勇猛武士，似乎战时休憩，

         依然披戴，出征的盔甲战衣。





        4.几乎没有，祈祷或是祝愿，

         亦没有， 半句悲伤话语；

         默默凝视，死者惨白面孔，

         不由嗟叹，是否明天的自己？





        5.匆忙平整，那块狭窄墓穴，

         从今往后，对手抑或过客，

         再亦不会，惊扰他的睡眠，

         我们又将迎接，新的血雨腥风。



        6.鬼神们，轻声谈论摩尔先生，

         尸骨未寒，却遭讥笑奚落；

         他全然不理，是否自己获许，

         竟径直躺在，英国佬棺椁上面。





        7.撤离钟声，已经敲响，

         事业未竟，道路崎岖漫长，

         远处，敌人的稀疏枪声，

         黎明将来临，夜色未央。





        8.哀伤欲绝，我们掩埋英雄，

         他戎马一生，鲜血浸透大地，

         不见碑石，甚至没有碑文，

         唯有英名，在战士心底追忆。





        LESSON 101





LITTLE VICTORIES


        微小的胜利

        1. “O Mother, now that I have lost my limb, I can never be a soldier or a sailor; I can never go round the world!” And Hugh burst into tears, now more really afflicted[50] than he had ever been yet. His mother sat on the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as they flowed, while he told her, as well as his sobs would let him, how long and how much he had reckoned[51] on going round the world, and how little he cared for anything else in future; and now this was the very thing he should never be able to do!

        2. He had practiced climbing ever since he could remember, and now this was of no use; he had practiced marching, and now he should never march again. When he had finished his complaint, there was a pause, and his mother said,

        “Hugh, you have heard of Huber?”

        “The man who found out so lunch about bees?” said Hugh.

        “Bees and ants. When Huber had discovered more than had ever been known about these, and when he was sure that he could learn still more, and was more and more anxious to peep into their tiny homes and curious ways, he became blind.”

        3. Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.

        “Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of the greatest musical composers[52] that ever lived. His great, his sole delight was in music. It was the passion of his life. When all his time and all his mind were given to music, he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf; so that he never more heard one single note from the loudest orchestra[53]. While crowds were moved and delighted with his compositions, it was all silence to him.” Hugh said nothing.

        4. “Now do you think,” asked his mother—and Hugh saw that a mild and gentle smile beamed from her countenance—“do you think that these people were without a Heavenly Parent?”

        “O no! but were they patient?” asked Hugh.

        “Yes, in their different ways and degrees. Would you suppose that they were hardly treated? Or would you not rather suppose that their Father gave them something better to do than they had planned for themselves?”

        5. “He must know best, of course; but it does seem very hard that that very thing should happen to them. Huber would not have so much minded being deaf, perhaps; or that musical man, being blind.

        “No doubt their hearts often swelled within them at their disappointments; but I fully believe that they very soon found God’s will to be wiser than their wishes. They found, if they bore their trial well, that there was work for their hearts to do far nobler than any the head could do through the eye or the ear. And they soon felt a new and delicious pleasure which none but the bitterly disappointed can feel.”



              “What is that?”

        6. “The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and of agreeing with God silently, when nobody knows what is in the breast. There is no pleasure like that of exercising one’s soul in bearing pain, and of finding one’s heart glow with the hope that one is pleasing God.”

        “Shall I feel that pleasure? ”

        “Often and often, I have no doubt; every time you can willingly give up your wish to be a soldier or a sailor, or anything else you have set your mind upon, you will feel that pleasure. But I do not expect it of you yet. I dare say it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see hundreds of people in raptures with his music, when he could not hear a note of it.”

        7. “But did he ever smile again?” asked Hugh.

        “If he did, he was happier than all the fine music in the world could have made him,” replied his mother.

        “I wonder, oh, I wonder, if I shall ever feel so!”

        “We will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask him now?” Hugh clasped his hands. His mother kneeled beside the bed, and, in a very few words, prayed that Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune well, and that his friends might give him such help and comfort as God should approve[54].

        8. Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes, such as no one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to pity as they deserved. On one occasion, when he had been quite merry for a while, and his mother and his sister Agnes were chatting, they thought they heard a sob from the sofa. They spoke to Hugh, and found that he was indeed crying bitterly.

        “What is it, my dear?” said his mother. “Agnes, have we said anything that could hurt his feelings?”

        “No, no,” sobbed Hugh. “I will tell you, presently.”

        9. And, presently, he told them that he was so busy listening to what they said that he forgot everything else, when he felt as if something had gotten between two of his toes; unconsciously he put down his hand as if his foot were there! Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in his toes; and then, when he put out his hand, and found nothing, it was so terrible, it startled him so! It was a comfort to find that his mother knew about this. She came, and kneeled by his sofa, and told him that many persons who had lost a limb considered this the most painful thing they had to bear for some time; but that, though the feeling would return occasionally through life, it would cease to be painful.

        10. Hugh was very much dejected[55], and when he thought of the months and years to the end of his life, and that he should never run and play, and never be like other people, he almost wished that he were dead.

        Agnes thought that he must be miserable indeed if he could venture to say this to his mother. She glanced at her mother’s face, but there was no displeasure there. On the contrary, she said this feeling was very natural. She had felt it herself under smaller misfortunes than Hugh’s; but she had found, though the prospect appeared all strewn with troubles, that they came singly, and were not so hard to bear, after all.



              11. She told Hugh that when she was a little girl she was very lazy, fond of her bed, and not at all fond of dressing or washing.

        “Why, mother! you?” exclaimed Hugh.

        “Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was. Well, I was in despair, one day, at the thought that I should have to wash, and clean my teeth, and brush my hair, and put on every article of dress, every morning, as long as I lived.”

        “Did you tell anybody?” asked Hugh.

        12. “No, I was ashamed to do that; but I remember I cried. You see how it turns out. When we have become accustomed to anything, we do it without ever thinking of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us, the clock that has to tick so many millions of times, has exactly the same number of seconds to do it in. So will you find that you can move about on each separate occasion, as you wish, and practice will enable you to do it without any trouble or thought.”

        “But this is not all, nor half what I mean,” said Hugh.

        13. “No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear. You resolved to bear it all patiently, I remember. But what is it you dread the most?”

        “Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other people.”

        “Some things,” replied his mother. “You can never play cricket, as every Crofton boy would like to do. You can never dance at your sister’s Christmas parties.”

        14. “O mamma!” cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and with the thought in her mind that it was cruel to talk so.

        “Go on! Go on!” cried Hugh, brightening. “You know what I feel, mother; and you don’t keep telling me, as others do, and even sister Agnes, sometimes, that it will not signify much, and that I shall not care, and all that; making out that it is no misfortune, hardly, when I know what it is, and they don’t. Now, then, go on, mother! What else?”

        15. “There will be little checks and mortifications continually, when you see little boys leaping over this, and climbing that, and playing at the other, while you must stand out, and can only look on. And some people will pity you in a way you will not like: and some may even laugh at you.”

        “O mamma!” exclaimed Agnes.

        “Well, and what else?” said Hugh.

        16. “Sooner or later you will have to follow some way of life determined by this accident instead of one that you would have liked better.”

        “Well, what else?”

        “I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more; and I hope there is not much else; for, indeed, I think here is quite enough for a boy, or anyone else, to bear.”

        “I will bear it though; you will see.”

        17. “You will find great helps. These misfortunes of themselves strengthen one’s mind. They have some advantages too. You will be a better scholar for your lameness, I have no doubt. You will read more books, and have a mind richer in thoughts. You will be more beloved by us all, and you yourself will love God more for having given you something to bear for his sake. God himself will help you to bear your trials. You will conquer your troubles one by one, and by a succession of LITTLE VICTORIES will at last completely triumph over all.”





        —Harriet Martineau.

        1．“哦，妈妈，我现在已经失去了一条腿，我不能成为战士或者水手，再也不能周游世界了！”休嚎啕大哭，从未像今天这样饱经痛苦折磨。休的妈妈坐在他的床边，擦去休的满脸泪水。休抽泣着，向妈妈尽情倾诉他的心中委屈。多年来，他憧憬有一天能周游世界，甚而很少为世俗喧嚣杂事烦扰，但由于残疾，他将永远无法实现自己的梦想了。

        2．从记事起，休就开始练习爬行，现在爬行用不上了；他还练习过走路，如今再也断然不能走路了。休不再抱怨后，母子俩静静沉默了一会，妈妈开口说，“休，你听说过胡伯尔这个人吗？”“就是那个发现蜜蜂食物许多奥秘的人？”休问道。

        “是的，还有蚂蚁。当胡伯尔发现更多他以往不知道的东西，他就相信，他肯定会了解更多；他愈想了解更多，他就愈发急切地窥探蜜蜂以及蚂蚁的微小巢穴，甚至它们奇妙的生活方法，最后，他竟然成了瞎子。”

        3．休叹了口气，妈妈接着说，“你听说过贝多芬吗？他是迄今为止最伟大的一位作曲家，他的伟大、他的唯一快乐在于音乐，音乐是他生活的所有激情。当他的时光心血全部奉献给音乐的时候，他突然失去了听力，彻底变聋了。他再也听不见任何音符，即使交响乐团恢弘的现场演奏，当人群为他的作曲欢呼雀跃，他却沉浸在一片无声世界。”休听后缄默无言。

        4．“你现在想到了吗？”他的妈妈问道，此刻的休看见妈妈脸上露出温柔灿烂的微笑，“是否想过，假若没有天上圣父，这些人该怎么办？”“哦，不会！如果他们坚韧、具有耐心呢？”休问道。

        “不错，每人认知方式或程度不尽相同，你认为他们理应命运坎坷？或者，你难道宁愿认为圣父不会为他们安排更好，甚至不会超过他们自身的选择？”

        5．“当然，人，应该明理通透，不过，不可理喻的事恰恰发生在自己身上，怎么来看，这道关隘始终难以超越。胡伯尔不可能想到他会变瞎；对贝多芬来说，或许压根没想到他会失去听力。”

         “毫无疑问，这些人时常为失望困扰不堪，但我完全相信，他们很快就会明白，上帝旨意比个人祈求或愿望更为睿智。如果他们坦然地承受厄运的降临，就会明白他们用心去做的事情，比其他任何头脑仅仅通过眼或耳机械去做的事情远远高尚很多。无需多久，他们就会身心感受其他任何人无从领略的、一种新奇美好的欢欣，唯独那些最为痛苦失望的人才能悟出其中玄妙。”



              “那是什么呢？”

        6．“当无人知道什么才是心中的信念，这种快乐在于唤醒浑噩灵魂去承受痛苦，安静地顺从上帝安排。世上没有任何快乐能够与之媲美，它旨在培养个体灵魂去承担痛苦，或发掘因希望而熠熠生辉的个体心灵，正是这种星光使上帝感动宽慰。”

        “那么，我能感到那种快乐吗？”

        “你会经常不断地感受到，这一点，我毫不怀疑。每当你愿意放弃成为士兵或水手的希望，其实，其他志存高远的目标已在你的心底孕成，你会感到那种欢欣。当然，我并不指望这种内心升华很快出现。对贝多芬来说，他听不见一个音符，最终却看到一百个观众为他的音乐欣喜若狂；我敢说，那条路实在痛苦漫长。”



        7．“那么，他重新感到幸福吗？”休问道。

        “如果他感到幸福，那肯定超过世界上所有美好音乐带给他的无穷快乐。”他的妈妈回答。

        “我想知道，哦，想知道，如果我也能感到这些幸福，该有多好！”

        “我们会向上帝祷告，你可以做到，现在开始祷告，好吗？”

        听了妈妈的话，休合拢手掌，妈妈跪在床边，两人默默地低声呢喃，保佑休能够坦然面对他的不幸，保佑休的朋友将给予他帮助安慰，而这些都是上帝极为赞赏的。

        8．休有时觉得自己极易为痛苦现实感伤，这点，任何其他人或许无法完全明白，他害怕没有任何人怜悯那些值得同情的残疾人。有一次，休的妈妈和姐姐艾格尼丝在聊天，休显得非常开心，可不一会，她们听到沙发后面的哭泣声，两人这才发现休哭得十分伤心。

         “怎么回事？亲爱的？”妈妈问道，“艾格尼丝，我们说过什么话伤害休的感情吗？”

        “没有，没有，”休哭着说，“我等会告诉你们。”

        9．过了一会，休告诉妈妈和姐姐，刚才他专心致志地听他们两人说话，突然感到脚趾间好像有什么东西，他毫无意识地探了下手，似乎觉得他的脚还在！全身脚趾间的感觉那么清楚真切，可当他伸手摸去，让他错愕不已的是，只有空空的裤脚！幸运的是，妈妈谙知他的心事，她走了过来，跪在休的沙发边，对儿子说，失去腿脚的许多人，不得不承受人生最为黑暗痛苦、身有残疾的事实，但这只是一段时间，这种感觉以后时而还会有，甚至持续终生，但痛苦的感觉最终将会消失。



              10．想到失去条腿，往后年复一年甚至直到生命的终点，休灰心沮丧简直到了极点，想到他永远不会跑步玩耍，永远不会像别人一样，他巴望自己不如马上死去的好。姐姐艾格尼丝以为休肯定心里太难过，才对母亲说出心里话。她瞥了母亲一眼，母亲脸上却没有一丝不开心的神情，反而说休的感情很自然，她曾经也遭遇过，尽管面对的挫折比儿子要小。前方的路充满苦难纠结，不过她最后发现，她毕竟一步步坚持挺过来了，当然，天底下没有过不去的坎。

        11．妈妈告诉休，当她还是个小姑娘的时候，她实在很懒，喜欢赖床不起，讨厌穿衣洗漱。

        “为什么呢？妈妈，天呀！”休尖声叫道。

        “没错，我就是那样的孩子，是的，有一天，一想到每天早上我该去洗脸，该去刷牙，该去梳头，该穿戴整齐，只要活着，千篇一律地该做这做那，我就变得沮丧绝望。”

        “你和别人谈过这些吗？”休问妈妈。

        12．“没有，我那时羞于告诉别人，可我记得，我哭了。你看这事原本就是这样。如果凡事安然若素，我们就不会忧心自扰。有句俗话说得好，时钟需要滴答百万上亿次，确切地说，走过无外乎相同数字的分秒。所以，你应该不难发现，如同你所希望的，你可依据不同的场合处人行事，一旦形成习惯，也就觉察不到任何烦扰或者纠结。”

        “这不是最糟糕的，离我要面对的实在差得还远。”休说。

        13．“是的，亲爱的，谈论这些，即使远不及你需要承受的，你也要学会耐心地面对，我记得。你最害怕的是什么？”

        “哎呀！再不能像别人那样，我所有的行为方式全部改变了。”

         “并非所有事情，”妈妈说道，“当然，你再不能像每个克罗夫顿男孩那样去打板球，你也不能在你姐姐的圣诞聚会上跳舞。”

        14．“哦，妈妈！” 艾格尼丝叫了起来，眼里满是泪水，心里想这样谈话对弟弟来说，实在太残忍。

        “接着说！说呀！”休叫着，眼里闪着焦灼的光，“妈妈，你知道我的感受；你不要不停地告诉我，像别人那样做，甚至像姐姐艾格尼丝那样做，有时，这些并不意味多么重要，我也不会在意，所有这些说明，我绝不是那么不幸，或者几乎不幸，当我明白这些，什么痛苦看来都是浮云。好了，接着说，妈妈！还有什么教诲？”



              15．“当你看见那些男孩子们蹦蹦跳跳，攀上爬下，与其他孩子一起玩耍，你总想站出来，最后却只能袖手旁观，你总会感到内心些许压抑，或者某种耻辱。有人怜悯你，你却不乐意那种直白的表达方式，更有人索性嘲笑你。”

        “噢，妈妈，别说了！”艾格尼丝叫喊。

        “好了，还有什么？”休说。

        16．“或迟或早，你都得遵循某种生活方式，这种方式当然由本身局限决定，而不是你内心指望的更好方式。”

        “好的，还有吗？”

        “现在，我来问你，我想不出还有什么；我但愿没有更多的需要提醒；因为，的确，我这里所说的，对一个男孩或其他任何孩子，需要承受的已经足够多了。”

        “虽然我得承受，不过，你会看到。”

        17．“你会得到无私的帮助。不幸本身将使个体灵魂日趋强大，这也是不幸的悖论。由于残疾缘故，你会成为一位优秀学者，这点，我毫不怀疑。你会博览群书，头脑睿智敏锐，思想深邃丰富，你也将赢得我们大家更多眷爱。你本人将对上帝更加虔诚，因为他已让你承受更多的生活磨难，而你所作所为不过在为上帝受难；上帝将帮助你忍受无穷苦难；你会接连不断地征服你的困难，正是通过系列微小的胜利，你才能最终完全战胜人生的所有艰难。”

        LESSON 102





THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE


        幸福生活的特点

        Sir Henry Wotton (b. 1568, d. 1639) was born at Bocton Hall, Kent, England. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1598 he was taken into the service of the Earl of Essex, as one of his secretaries. On the Earl’s committal to the Tower for treason, Wotton fled to France; but he returned to England immediately after the death of Elizabeth, and received the honor of knighthood. He was King James’s favorite diplomatist, and, in 1623, was appointed provost of Eton College. Wotton wrote a number of prose works; but his literary reputation rests mainly on some short poems, which are distinguished by a dignity of thought and expression rarely excelled.





        1. How happy is he born and taught,

        That serveth not another’s will;

        Whose armor is his honest thought,

        And simple truth his utmost skill!





        2. Whose passions not his masters are,

        Whose soul is still prepared for death,

        Untied unto the worldly care

        Of public fame, or private breath;

        3. Who envies none that chance doth raise,

        Or vice; who never understood

        How deepest wounds are given by praise;

        Nor rules of state, but rules of good:





        4. Who hath his life from rumors freed,

        Whose conscience is his strong retreat;

        Whose state can neither flatterers feed,

        Nor ruin make oppressors great;

        5. Who God doth late and early pray,

        More of his grace than gifts to lend;

        And entertains the harmless day

        With a religious book or friend.





        6. This man is freed from servile bands,

        Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;

        Lord of himself, though not of lands;

        And having nothing, yet hath all.




【中文阅读】

        亨利 · 沃顿爵士（1568～1639年），出生于英国肯特郡博克顿豪尔，曾进入温彻斯特大学与牛津大学接受教育。大约1598年，他被埃塞克斯伯爵雇用为私人秘书。当伯爵以叛国罪押送伦敦古堡监狱时，沃顿逃往法国。伊丽莎白去世后，他即刻返回英国，并接受了骑士授勋。国王詹姆斯看好他的应变能力，1623年，他被任命为伊顿学院院长。沃顿发表过一些散文作品，不过他的文学声誉主要限于诗歌短章，这些诗歌因思想高贵及超凡脱俗的表现力而著称于世。





        1．幸福，后天的良好教育，

        侍从，原非他人本意，

        坦诚真挚，方坚韧强势，

        常人难及，行知合一的技能！





        2．冷静睿智，并非凭借激情，

        义无反顾，为死亡做好准备，

        远离世俗，蝇营狗苟之利，

        声名地位，一笑过眼烟云。





        3．无需嫉妒，那些人脱颖而出，

        抑或指责，无法洞悉的堕落，

        盛誉，使他深受伤害，以及

        社会秩序，与良知背驰而行。





        4．生活当中，远离诋毁小人，

        道德良知，首推要则公义，

        对阿谀谄媚者，惯以冷眼应对，

        没有任何毁灭，能让强权矗立。





        5．无论何时， 上帝为其祝福，

        恩泽无边， 超越世俗范畴，

        翻读圣经， 与友倾心交谈，

        从容享受， 岁月姝好安宁。





        6．傲世独立， 远离乌合之众，

        不求发迹， 亦不恐惧坠落，

        精神丰盈， 尽管鲜有财产，

        月白风清， 内心富足一生。





        LESSON 103





THE ART OF DISCOURAGEMENT


        泼冷水的艺术

        Arthur Helps (b. 1813, d. 1875) graduated at Cambridge, England, in 1835. His best known works are: “Friends in Council, a Series of Readings and Discourses,” “Companions of my Solitude,” and “Realmah,” a tale of the “lake dwellers” in southern Europe. He has also written a “History of the Spanish Conquests in America,” two historical dramas, and several other works. Mr. Helps was a true thinker, and his writings are deservedly popular with thoughtful readers. In 1859 he was appointed secretary of the privy council.





        1. Regarding, one day, in company with a humorous friend, a noble vessel of a somewhat novel construction sailing slowly out of port, he observed, “What a quantity of cold water somebody must have had down his back.” In my innocence, I supposed that he alluded to the wet work of the artisans who had been building the vessel; but when I came to know him better, I found that this was the form of comment he always indulged in when contemplating any new and great work, and that his “somebody” was the designer of the vessel.

        2. My friend had carefully studied the art of discouragement, and there was a class of men whom he designated[56] simply as “cold-water pourers.” It was most amusing to hear him describe the lengthened sufferings of the man who first designed a wheel; of him who first built a boat; of the adventurous personage who first proposed the daring enterprise of using buttons, instead of fish bones, to fasten the scanty raiment of some savage tribe.

        3. Warming with his theme, he would become quite eloquent in describing the long career of discouragement which these rash men had brought upon themselves, and which he said, to his knowledge, must have shortened their lives. He invented imaginary dialogues between the unfortunate inventor, say of the wheel, and his particular friend, some eminent cold-water pourer. For, as he said, every man has some such friend, who fascinates him by fear, and to whom he confides his enterprises in order to hear the worst that can be said of them.

        4. The sayings of the chilling friend, probably, as he observed, ran thus:—“We seem to have gone on very well for thousands of years without this rolling thing. Your father carried burdens on his back. The king is content to be borne on men’s shoulders. The high priest is not too proud to do the same. Indeed, I question whether it is not irreligious to attempt to shift from men’s shoulders their natural burdens.

        5. “Then, as to its succeeding,—for my part, I see no chance of that. How can it go up hill? How often you have failed before in other fanciful things of the same nature! Besides, you are losing your time; and the yams[57] about your hut are only half planted. You will be a beggar; and it is my duty, as a friend, to tell you so plainly.



              6. “There was Nang-chung: what became of him? We had found fire for ages, in a proper way, taking a proper time about it, by rubbing two sticks together. He must needs strike out fire at once, with iron and flint; and did he die in his bed? Our sacred lords saw the impiety of that proceeding, and very justly impaled[58] the man who imitated heavenly powers. And, even if you could succeed with this new and absurd rolling thing, the state would be ruined. What would become of those who carry burdens on their backs? Put aside the vain fancies of a childish mind, and finish the planting of your yams.”

        7. It is really very curious to observe how, even in modern times, the arts of discouragement prevail. There are men whose sole pretense to wisdom consists in administering discouragement. They are never at a loss. They are equally ready to prophesy, with wonderful ingenuity, all possible varieties of misfortune to any enterprise that may be proposed; and when the thing is produced, and has met with some success, to find a flaw in it.

        8. I once saw a work of art produced in the presence of an eminent cold-water pourer. He did not deny that it was beautiful; but he instantly fastened upon a small crack in it that nobody had observed; and upon that crack he would dilate[59] whenever the work was discussed in his presence. Indeed, he did not see the work, but only the crack in it. That flaw,—that little flaw,—was all in all to him.

        9. The cold-water pourers are not all of one form of mind. Some are led to indulge in this recreation from genuine timidity. They really do fear that all new attempts will fail. Others are simply envious and ill-natured. Then, again, there is a sense of power and wisdom in prophesying evil. Moreover, it is the safest thing to prophesy, for hardly anything at first succeeds exactly in the way that it was intended to succeed.

        10. Again, there is the lack of imagination which gives rise[60] to the utterance of so much discouragement. For an ordinary man, it must have been a great mental strain to grasp the ideas of the first projectors[61] of steam and gas, electric telegraphs, and pain-deadening chloroform. The inventor is always, in the eyes of his fellow-men, somewhat of a madman; and often they do their best to make him so.

        11. Again, there is the want of sympathy; and that is, perhaps, the ruling cause in most men’s minds who have given themselves up to discourage. They are not tender enough, or sympathetic enough, to appreciate all the pain they are giving, when, in a dull plodding way, they lay out argument after argument to show that the project which the poor inventor has set his heart upon, and upon which, perhaps, he has staked his fortune, will not succeed.

        12. But what inventors suffer, is only a small part of what mankind in general endure from thoughtless and unkind discouragement. Those high-souled men belong to the suffering class, and must suffer; but it is in daily life that the wear and tear of discouragement tells so much. Propose a small party of pleasure to an apt discourager, and see what he will make of it. It soon becomes sicklied over with doubt and despondency; and, at last, the only hope of the proposer is, that his proposal, when realized, will not be an ignominious failure. All hope of pleasure, at least for the proposer, has long been out of the question.

        阿瑟 · 海伯斯（1813～1875），1835年毕业于英国剑桥大学，他最为著名的作品包括《枢密院之友，系列读物与论述》、《我的孤独伴侣》及《真诚的人》讲述的是欧洲南部湖畔居者的故事。阿瑟 · 海伯斯写有题为《西班牙美洲征服史》的两部历史剧及其他作品，他推崇深度思考，在关切思考的作者群中享有很高声誉。1859年，他被任命为枢密院院长。





        1．有一天，我与一位风趣幽默的朋友正在聊天，一艘造型颇为新奇的宏伟轮船缓缓地驶离港口，他注视那船说道：“有的人脊梁骨上该是泼过多少凉水。”以我天真揣度，我猜想，朋友不过暗指那些顶风冒雨建造那艘轮船的工匠们，但随着话语展开，我才得以了解个中玄机。这位朋友长期沉湎于研究整套创新思维的话语体系，他说的“有的人”，指的是该艘轮船的设计者。

        2．我的那位朋友曾深入研究过气馁艺术，他将创新者定义为“被泼凉水的人”。听他叙述那位轮船设计师经久多年的痛苦煎熬，倒是挺有意思。那家伙第一次设计出车轮，第一次建造出小船；极爱冒险的他，也是第一次提出大胆创意，用按钮取代鱼骨来固定原始部落野人身上那些衣不蔽体的衣服。

        3．一旦深入这类话题，朋友随即口若悬河，滔滔不绝地谈起那些鲁莽草率人士无端为自己带来气馁沮丧的漫长生涯。据他所说，他清楚这些气馁沮丧无疑将缩短人的寿命，他还撰写与那位背运的轮船设计师之间虚拟对话。他谈到车轮，谈到他那位超凡脱俗的设计师朋友，谈到某位著名的泼冷水者。诚如斯言，确实，我们每人周围都有类似朋友，他们因恐惧而对这些发明达人萌生迷恋，而这些达人之所以乐意倾露心事，叙说自己花样翻新的冒险，不过只是关注可能反馈回来的批评或指责。

        4．如他的观察所见，朋友间心寒齿冷的话语或许如此，“没有那个滚动的家伙，几千年呼啦啦过去了，我们不也过得很好嘛！一路神气十足地走来？你老爸肩驮背扛，国王坐在轿夫肩膀上自得其乐，那些大神甫祭司们也并非过于自傲，不能手提肩扛。”确实如此，而我想质疑的是，从人类肩膀上试图移走他们的物质重负，唯道居然违反宗教教义不成？

        5．“那么，对于这种承继，就我来说，我看不到任何改变机会。那车轮莫非能爬山？面对类似稀奇古怪想法，你屡屡受挫究竟多少回！况且，还要浪费大量时间，茅屋边番薯地还有很多农活没做，没准厮混下去，你或许还会沦为乞丐。作为朋友，我当然有责任直截了当地提醒你。”

        6．“历史上有过纳春野人，他们的后裔进化如何？很久以前，人类以某种合适方式、在某种特定场合下发现了火。那时，野人迫切需要生火，他们将两根枝干相互摩挲，倘若机缘巧合，仓促中用铁与燧石试着摩擦，火，就这样被发现了，有野人因失火死在自己床上吗？相反，那些原始部落领主们看到那些不虔诚行为，干脆将那位试图模仿圣父魔力的人处以钉刑，这事看起来还挺正义。这样说来，是否你仍然琢磨那个新奇荒谬的滚动东西，你的族群甚至亦会面临灭顶之灾。至于那些辛苦重负的人还能怎样？不妨将那些幼稚虚妄抛到一边，回家接着种完你的番薯罢。”



              7．即便现在，关注这门泼冷水艺术到处狼奔豸突，也不能不令人啧啧称奇。有这样一种人，其唯一睿智夸口在于如何实施泼凉水，他们不曾手足无措。一方面，针对可能提出的冒险创意，他们从惊天骇俗的独创适时预言，任何冒险可能导致不幸结局的种种可能；另一方面，一旦冒险创意进入实际运作，并取得一定成功，他们不会错失良机，开始百般挑剔。

        8．类似的事我曾经历过，有一回，某位名声显赫的泼冷水者观看创意冒险的实际操作。他不否认那创意挺好，但只死死盯住那东西内部的某道细缝，而其他人均未留意那道裂缝。后来，只要出席讨论那桩创新，他总会不厌其烦地尽力夸张那点瑕疵，当然，除却那道裂缝，他并不关注事情本身，那个缺陷——毕竟微不足道，可对他来说，瑕疵意味一切。

        9．泼冷水人心态各异。有的人由于真正胆怯，不由自主地陷入或沉湎这类娱乐消遣，他们确实内心恐惧所有创新尝试势必遭遇失败，而其他人则仅仅出于嫉妒或心存不良。那么，世上是否存在一种预言邪恶的力量与智慧？此外，看来预言最为安全妥当，因为几乎没有任何创意伊始就能获得大获成功，究其成功方式，初衷甚或结局，大多大相径庭。

        10．再来看看，由于想象力匮乏引起气馁情绪的普遍存在。对一位普通人来说，冒险行为无疑将承受巨大的精神负担，那种来自攫取最初创意灵感的压力。诸如蒸汽与燃气、电报或用作麻醉剂的氯仿，在旁观者看来，创新者多少难免走火入魔，他们往往更是不遗余力地促使冒险家抓狂。

        11．或许在大多数放弃自己、甘愿沉沦人的心里，关键原因在于缺乏同情心。他们不够温情脉脉，缺乏足够悲悯，无法感悟挫折失败给予人类的所有痛苦。他们以某种单调乏味方式，安排策划一场又一场创新会论辩，展示某位蹩脚发明者全身心投入的创意，或许，那家伙在给他的运气押宝撞大运，恐怕注定不会成功。



        12．然而，由于轻率或可恶的气馁，在人类经历的整体苦难中，创新者乖舛命运所占比例甚小。那些灵魂高尚的人隶属受难阶层，且必须历经劫难；不过庸常生活中，能够果敢地承受气馁失意最为难能可贵。不妨提议对易于失落之人举办小型欢乐聚会，观察他如何策划安排。由于疑虑失望诸多因素，破绽势必很快显露；而提议一旦付诸实施，提议者唯一指望不要遭遇可耻失败；但最终看来，至少对提议者来说，所有快乐希望已经毫无可能。





        LESSON 104





THE MARINER’S DREAM


        水手的梦

        William Dimond (b. 1780, d. 1837) was a dramatist and poet, living at Bath, England, where he was born and received his education. He afterwards studied for the bar in London. His literary productions are for the most part dramas, but he has also written a number of poems, among them the following:





        1. In slumbers of midnight the sailor boy lay;

        His hammock[62] swung loose at the sport of the wind;

        But watch-worn and weary, his cares flew away,

        And visions of happiness danced o’er his mind.





        2. He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,

        And pleasures that waited on life’s merry morn;

        While Memory each scene gayly covered with flowers,

        And restored every rose, but secreted the thorn.





        3. Then Fancy her magical pinions spread wide,

        And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise;

        Now, far, far behind him the green waters glide,

        And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes.





        4. The jessamine clambers in flowers o’er the thatch,

        And the swallow chirps sweet from her nest in the wall;

        All trembling with transport[63], he raises the latch,

        And the voices of loved ones reply to his call.





        5. A father bends o’er him with looks of delight;

        His cheek is impearled[64] with a mother’s warm tear;

        And the lips of the boy in a love kiss unite

        With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.





        6. The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast;

        Joy quickens his pulses,—all his hardships seem o’er;

        And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest,—

        “O God! thou hast blest me,—I ask for no more.”





        7. Ah! whence is that flame which now bursts on his eye?

        Ah! what is that sound that now ’larums[65] his ear?

        ’T is the lightning’s red glare painting hell on the sky!

        ’T is the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!





        8. He springs from his hammock,—he flies to the deck;

        Amazement confronts him with images dire;

        Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a wreck;

        The masts fly in splinters; the shrouds are on fire.





        9. Like mountains the billows tremendously swell;

        In vain the lost wretch calls on Mercy to save;

        Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,

        And the death angel flaps his broad wings o’er the wave!





        10. O sailor boy, woe to thy dream of delight!

        In darkness dissolves the gay frostwork of bliss!

        Where now is the picture that Fancy touched bright,—

        Thy parents’ fond pressure, and love’s honeyed kiss?





        11. O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again

        Shall home, love, or kindred, thy wishes repay;

        Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,

        Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.





        12. No tomb shall e’er plead to remembrance for thee,

        Or redeem form or fame from the merciless surge;

        But the white foam of waves shall thy winding sheet be,

        And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge[66].

        13. On a bed of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid,—

        Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;

        Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made,

        And every part suit to thy mansion below.

        14. Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away,

        And still the vast waters above thee shall roll;

        Earth loses thy pattern forever and aye;

        O sailor boy! sailor boy! peace to thy soul!

        1．午夜，少年水手进入睡眠，

        轻松随意的风，荡起吊床，

        褪下，白昼紧张的躯壳，

        心中， 美梦盘旋流连。





        2．浓密树荫下，家的幻觉，

        稚气地企盼，晨曦苏醒，

        欣然回想， 每簇花丛的记忆，

        品尝美好， 将痛苦深深藏匿。





        3．幻想鸟儿，离家愈飞愈近，

        痴迷眺望，颤栗不住的心悸，

        海水哗哗，恍惚消退走远，

        叠涌闪现，家乡亲人的眼睛。





        4．茉莉花树，越过颓圮屋顶，

        燕子唧啾，筑巢不再飘零，

        惊喜若狂中，他推开门闩，

        游子归来，父母的熟悉身影。





        5．年长水手，俯身疼爱的慈祥，

        梦中盘桓，晶莹泪花渗出，

        热烈的唇，散发轻吻清香，

        袅娜走来，久远的倩影佳人。





              6．少年的心， 怦怦地猛跳胸膛，

        脉搏加快， 痛苦消散不再，

        思恋话语， 溪水般潺潺流淌，

        哦，上帝保佑！微薄美梦成真。





        7．啊！你眼里火光，来自哪里？

        啊！你耳边声音， 来自何方？

        那是炸雷滚动，大地呻吟，

        闪电，将地狱腥红写在天上。





        8．少年从吊床跃起，飞身甲板，

        眼前，惊愕不已的景象，

        狂风巨浪，将船体撕裂，

        桅杆断成碎片，遍地火光。





        9．涌浪拍天，排山倒海扑来，

        落水的手，徒唤苍天在上，

        鬼神，敲响瘆人的丧钟，

        死亡天使，振翼掠过海浪。





        10．哦，水手少年，梦魇伴随灾难，

        黑暗融化，神佑的浪漫秋霜，

        父母钟爱，还有恋人温香，

        梦幻小船，究竟哪里迷航？





        11．哦，水手少年，你再亦无法

        回到家乡，一偿亲情夙愿，

        你不幸地， 默默葬身海底，

        冰冷海浪， 将蚀尽你的躯体。





        12．没有荒冢，为你掬起回忆，

        没有救赎，来自涛声奏响，



              浪花奔涌，裹起青春殓衣，

        寒冬夜半，铺开生命悲怆。





        13．你安卧海底，绿色花朵簇拥，

        白骨悄然， 红色珊瑚生长，

        你堇色头发，绺成琥珀丝线，

        时光凝固， 铺满平静安详。





        14．年复一年，岁月穿梭流转，

        你的身上，海浪訇然如常，

        你的身影，永远不会再现，

        哦，灵魂安息，帅美的水手少年！





        LESSON 105





THE PASSENGER PIGEON


        野鸽过客

        John James Audubon (b. 1780, d. 1851). This celebrated American ornithologist was born in Louisiana. When quite young he was passionately fond of birds, and took delight in studying their habits. In 1797 his father, an admiral in the French navy, sent him to Paris to be educated. On his return to America, he settled on a farm in eastern Pennsylvania, but afterward removed to Henderson, Ky., where he resided several years, supporting his family by trade, but devoting most of his time to the pursuit of his favorite study. In 1826 he went to England, and commenced the publication of the “Birds of America,” which consists of ten volumes—five of engravings of birds, natural size, and five of letterpress. Cuvier declares this work to be “the most magnificent monument that art has ever erected to ornithology.” In 1830 Audubon returned to America, and soon afterwards made excursions into nearly every section of the United States and Canada. A popular edition of his great work was published, in seven volumes, in 1844, and “The Quadrupeds of America,” in six volumes,—three of plates and three of letterpress, in 1846-50. He removed to the vicinity of New York about 1840, and resided there until his death.





        1. The multitudes of wild pigeons in our woods are astonishing. Indeed, after having viewed them so often, and under so many circumstances, I even now feel inclined to pause and assure myself that what I am going to relate is a fact. Yet I have seen it all, and that, too, in the company of persons who, like myself, were struck with amazement.

        2. In the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Henderson, on the banks of the Ohio, on my way to Louisville. In passing over the Barrens, a few miles beyond Hardinsburgh, I observed the pigeons flying, from northeast to southwest, in greater numbers than I thought I had ever seen them before, and feeling an inclination to count the flocks that might pass within the reach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated myself on an eminence, and began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every flock that passed.

        3. In a short time, finding the task which I had undertaken impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and, counting the dots then put down,found that one hundred and sixty-three had been made in twenty-one minutes I traveled on, and still met more the farther I proceeded. The air was literally filled with pigeons; the light of noonday was obscured as by an eclipse; and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose.

        4. Whilst waiting for dinner at Young’s inn, at the confluence of Salt River with the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure, immense legions still going by, with a front reaching far beyond the Ohio on the west, and the beech wood forests directly on the east of me. Not a single bird alighted, for not a nut or acorn was that year to be seen in the neighborhood. They consequently flew so high that different trials to reach them with a capital rifle proved ineffectual; nor did the reports disturb them in the least.



              5. I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their aerial[1] evolutions when a hawk chanced to press upon the rear of a flock. At once, like a torrent, and with a noise like thunder, they rushed into a compact mass, pressing upon each other towards the center. In these almost solid masses, they darted forward in undulating and angular lines, descended and swept close over the earth with inconceivable velocity, mounted perpendicularly so as to resemble a vast column, and, when high, were seen wheeling and twisting within their continued lines, which then resembled the coils of a gigantic serpent.

        6. As soon as the pigeons discover a sufficiency of food to entice them to alight, they fly round in circles, reviewing the country below. During their evolutions, on such occasions, the dense mass which they form exhibits a beautiful appearance, as it changes its direction, now displaying a glistening sheet of azure, when the backs of the birds come simultaneously into view, and anon[2] suddenly presenting a mass of rich, deep purple.

        7. They then pass lower, over the woods, and for a moment are lost among the foliage, but again emerge, and are seen gliding aloft. They now alight; but the next moment, as if suddenly alarmed, they take to wing, producing by the flappings of their wings a noise like the roar of distant thunder, and sweep through the forests to see if danger is near. Hunger, however, soon brings them to the ground.

        8. When alighted, they are seen industriously throwing up the withered leaves in quest of the fallen mast[3]. The rear ranks are continually rising, passing over the main body, and alighting in front, in such rapid succession, that the whole flock seems still on wing. The quantity of ground thus swept is astonishing; and so completely has it been cleared that the gleaner who might follow in their rear would find his labor completely lost.

        9. On such occasions, when the woods are filled with these pigeons, they are killed in immense numbers, although no apparent diminution ensues. About the middle of the day, after their repast is finished, they settle on the trees to enjoy rest and digest their food. As the sun begins to sink beneath the horizon; they depart en masse for the roosting place, which not unfrequently is hundreds of miles distant, as has been ascertained by persons who have kept an account of their arrivals and departures.

        10. Let us now inspect their place of nightly rendezvous[4]. One of these curious roosting places, on the banks of the Green River, in Kentucky, I repeatedly visited. It was, as is always the case, in a portion of the forest where the trees were of great magnitude, and where there was little underwood. I rode through it upwards of forty miles, and, crossing it in different parts, found its average breadth to be rather more than three miles. My first view of it was about a fortnight subsequent[5] to the period when they had made choice of it, and I arrived there nearly two hours before sunset.

        11. Many trees, two feet in diameter, I observed, were broken off at no great distance from the ground; and the branches of many of the largest and tallest had given way, as if the forest had been swept by a tornado. Everything proved to me that the number of birds resorting to this part of the forest must be immense beyond conception.



              12. As the period of their arrival approached, their foes anxiously prepared to receive them. Some were furnished with iron pots containing sulphur, others with torches of pine knots, many with poles, and the rest with guns. The sun was lost to our view, yet not a pigeon had arrived. Everything was ready, and all eyes were gazing on the clear sky, which appeared in glimpses amidst the tall trees. Suddenly there burst forth the general cry of, “Here they come!”

        13. The noise which they made, though yet distant, reminded me of a hard gale at sea passing through the rigging of a close-reefed vessel. As the birds arrived and passed over me, I felt a current of air that surprised me. Thousands were soon knocked down by the pole men. The birds continued to pour in. The fires were lighted, and a magnificent as well as wonderful and almost terrifying sight presented itself.

        14. The pigeons, arriving by thousands, alighted everywhere, one above another, until solid masses, as large as hogsheads, were formed on the branches all round. Here and there the perches gave way under the weight with a crash, and falling to the ground destroyed hundreds of the birds beneath, forcing down the dense groups with which every stick was loaded. It was a scene of uproar and confusion. I found it quite useless to speak or even to shout to those persons who were nearest to me. Even the reports of the guns were seldom heard, and I was made aware of the firing only by seeing the shooters reloading.

        15. The uproar continued the whole night; and as I was anxious to know to what distance the sound reached, I sent off a man, accustomed to perambulate[6] the forest, who, returning two hours afterwards, informed me he had heard it distinctly when three miles distant from the spot. Towards the approach of day, the noise in some measure subsided; long before objects were distinguishable, the pigeons began to move off in a direction quite different from that in which they had arrived the evening before, and at sunrise all that were able to fly had disappeared.

              1．北美森林里野生鸽子数量极为惊人，我的确经常在不少地方见过大批野鸽，即便现在，也坚持认为不要轻率做出结论，以确保自己陈述皆为事实。我和同伴都见过大批野鸽，彼此感受心同，那种形容毋庸说是身心震撼，难以言说的刻骨铭心。

        2．1813年秋天，离开坐落于俄亥俄河岸汉德森的家，我前去路易斯维尔。途中，当马车穿越一片荒原，驶过哈丁斯博格数英里后，我看到天空中由东北往西南方向飞来的黑压压的鸽群，眼见鸽群数量愈来愈多，甚至超过我有生以来所见总和，我心血来潮，突然想做次统计，计算一小时内目力所及范围内飞过的鸽群数，于是我便走下车，找处高坡坐下，开始用铅笔做记号，每见一个鸽群飞过就用圆点做个标注。

        3．不一会儿，我便发现我的记录完全无济于事，鸽群铺天盖地不断涌来，成片成队委实难计其数。我站立起来，数了数刚记下的标记，短短21分钟里，竟有163个鸽群在我眼前呼啸而过。我接着往前走，愈发见到更多，整座天空完全成为鸽子的飞翔世界。鸽群掠飞，宛如日食遮天蔽日，正午阳光亦随即黯淡起来。鸽群翼翅发出的嗡嗡翕动声，竟然让我产生昏昏欲睡的时空错觉。

        4．在当地青年旅馆就餐前的闲暇期间，在盐湖与俄亥俄州一处接壤地带，我看到黑云压顶的庞大鸽群军团大军压境般飞扑涌来。野鸽队伍前列早已长驱直入俄亥俄州西部，恰好抵达我所在位置东面的榉木森林。今年，就在周边地区，我观察到没有一只鸟儿落地不是为了觅食坚果或是橡果，但这些野鸽通常飞得很高，哪怕想方设法，甚至用最好的步枪猎杀也是徒劳无益，至于枪声干扰更是毫不奏效。

        5．实在无法描述野鸽群空中队列变化的奇异壮观。我碰巧看见一只老鹰逼近鸽群尾部，旋即，鸽群翻卷起一道狂涌气流，嘶鸣如雷，巨型队列迅速麇集成团，一只只叠起翅翼向中心靠拢，整个鸽群急遽地掠过空中；那排列齐整、棱角分明的队形波浪起伏，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，时而俯冲直下，时而横扫而过，时而扶摇直上，犹如庞大柱体径直腾空而起。它们不停地翻扭旋转，连绵不断地幻变组合队形，偌大天空中整齐划一的凌空翱翔，犹如一条巨龙倒海翻江。

        6．每当鸽群发现可引诱其降落的充足食物，它们便在天空盘旋不停，观察地面动静。在变幻多端的队形中，麇集鸽群的靓丽色彩令人击节赞叹。倏尔，羽翼头部一片亮晶晶的蔚蓝扑面而来；旋即，羽翼背部一团浓郁艳丽的深紫夺路而去。



        7．低低掠过灌丛的鸽群，不时徜徉流连于树杈丛林间，一转眼，又重新聚集飞往高处。此刻，鸽群落到地面，哪怕丁点响动，便会急速拍打双翼腾空而起。偌大鸽群拍打翼翅，听起来像远方滚过的一阵阵轰鸣雷声。鸽群不时穿越树林，它们仔细察觉周围是否存在危险，不过，饥肠骨碌的它们很快再度落地觅食。





              8．一旦降临地面，野鸽们便开始翻找地上的枯枝残叶，尽可能寻觅地上的橡树果实，而鸟群后翼队伍继续保持低飞，直到飞过整个鸽群，飞到前方落地，这种连续快捷的队列，使整个鸽群处于随时起飞状态。当然，大面积地面果实将被劫掠一空，犹如刚刚结束彻底清扫，倘若有拾穗人跟在鸽群后捡拾，终将一无所获。

        9.这种情况下，野鸽遭遇捕杀的数量相当惊人，尽管尚未有明显的大批锐减，因为森林原野里的野鸽持续不断涌来。大约中午，野鸽结束觅食后，它们往往栖息枝杈歇息或消化食物。每当夕阳快要落山，鸽群便成群结队地分开，寻找各自过夜的栖息地，不同鸽群宿眠地相隔数百英里未必鲜见，有人通过记录鸽群每天栖宿细节已予以证实。

         10．我们不妨来看看鸽群的夜间麇集地。令人关注的其中一处栖息地位于肯特基州格林河畔，我先后前去查勘过好几次，类似情况极为常见，那条河岸毗邻森林，四周林木葱郁，林下灌丛稀少。我曾驾车穿林而过，溯流直上达四十英里开外。我还在不同地带越过这片广袤森林，最终查明这处林地平均宽度已超过3英里，鸽群选择来此处栖息过夜。大约半月后，那天太阳下山两个时辰前，我第一次步行踏进这片密林。

        11．森林里巨树参天，我观察到，不少树的直径已达两英尺，这些树地面间距委实不大，不少高大树木的低矮枝杈更是早已砍伐殆尽，好似无情的龙卷风肆虐地掠过林中。对我来说，所有情况皆已表明，此地森林夜间栖息的野鸽数目惊人，不可思议或者简直难以想象。

        12．当鸽群快要飞临森林上空时，鸟类天敌正焦急地等待捕获它们。有的人拿着装有硫黄的铁罐，还有人擎着松节火把，更多的人拿着棍棒树干，还有的人扛着枪支。太阳落入西边边陲，人们见不到丁点鸽子的踪影，万事俱备。那株株参天大树蓊郁浓荫遮天蔽日，唯有树顶流泻出窄细光亮，透过少许光亮，人们在仰望中焦急等待。突然，人群中爆发一阵叫喊，“野鸽来了！”

        13．人们分散距离颇远，森林里一片嘈杂鼎沸。此情此景，令我突然想起海面狂风乍起，猛地扑向紧紧收起船帆的小船。当鸽群逐渐飞近掠过我的头顶，一阵惊悚让我的心痉挛收紧。成千上万只鸟儿即将倒毙于这帮明火执仗的屠夫脚下。野鸽黑压成片、汹涌不断地飞来，涌来，扑来，无数只火把已经点燃，一袭壮观恢弘的杀戮大幕正在拉开。



              14．遮天蔽日的野鸽落下来了，雨点般叠落下来，举目满眼的鸽子到处翻飞，粗硕酒桶般、成群成团地急遽降落，迅速挤满周围所有高矮不等的大小枝桠。接连不断的坠落冲力，使得方才落脚来及站稳的鸟们纷纷坠下，压翻甚至撞死下端的同类；每一根坠弯的树枝上，到处站满了密密麻麻的鸽子，骚动混乱的恐怖气息，在偌大森林里铺开弥漫。我感到自己的孤零无助，无法与哪怕离我最近的人说上几句话，甚至叫上几嗓子；我几乎听不见任何枪声，直到看到持枪的人们不停地装卸子弹，才惊悚意识到一场疯狂嗜血的屠杀正在紧锣密鼓进行。

        15．血腥喧嚣持续了整整一夜。我当时急切想知道这场残忍的杀戮究竟传及多远，于是便派出一位熟悉当地森林地形的人前去了解情况。两小时后，他回来告诉我，哪怕距此三英里开外的地方，激烈的枪声亦能清晰听见。天将破晓时，嘈杂声逐渐平息下来。其实，天亮前很久，鸽群已开始飞离，与当晚它们飞来降落的方向截然不同。太阳冉冉升起，所有再度起飞的野鸽早已消逝得无影无踪。

THE COUNTRY LIFE


        乡村生活

        Richard Henry Stoddard (b. 1825, d.1903) was born at Hingham, Mass., but removed to New York City while quite young. His first volume of poems, “Foot-prints,” appeared in 1849, and has been followed by many others. Of these may be mentioned “Songs of Summer,” “Town and Country,” “The King’s Bell,” “Abraham Lincoln” (an ode), and the “Book of the East,” from the last of which the following selection is abridged. Mr. Stoddard’s verses are full of genuine feeling, and some of them show great poetic power.





        1. Not what we would, but what we must,

        Makes up the sum of living:

        Heaven is both more and less than just,

        In taking and in giving.

        Swords cleave to hands that sought the plow,

        And laurels miss the soldier’s brow.





        2. Me, whom the city holds, whose feet

        Have worn its stony highways,

        Familiar with its loneliest street,—

        Its ways were never my ways.

        My cradle was beside the sea,

        And there, I hope, my grave will be.





        3. Old homestead! in that old gray town

        Thy vane is seaward blowing;

        Thy slip of garden stretches down

        To where the tide is flowing;

        Below they lie, their sails all furled,

        The ships that go about the world.





        4. Dearer that little country house,

        Inland with pines beside it;

        Some peach trees, with unfruitful boughs,

        A well, with weeds to hide it:

        No flowers, or only such as rise

        Self-sown—poor things!—which all despise.





              5. Dear country home! can I forget

        The least of thy sweet trifles?

        The window vines that clamber yet,

        Whose blooms the bee still rifles?

        The roadside blackberries, growing ripe,

        And in the woods the Indian pipe?





        6. Happy the man who tills his field,

        Content with rustic labor;

        Earth does to him her fullness yield,

        Hap what may to his neighbor.

        Well days, sound nights—oh, can there be

        A life more rational and free?

        1．随波逐流，我们习惯坦然，

        无外乎， 生活归纳的深刻，

        苍天在上，接受抑或付出，

        区别在于，每人或多或少。

        刀剑在手，扶动犁铧的大手，

        功成名就，乃万骨筑垒铺就。





        2．城市呵， 羁绊我的双脚，

        奔波跋涉， 砾石将心磨破，

        空荡无人的街道，熟悉清晰，

        没有尽头，孤独中云山雾罩。

        海滩微风， 荡起我的摇篮，

        千年沉睡的故乡，魂归何处？





              3．古老家园，快乐安详小镇，

        面朝大海，风向旗猎猎地吹，

        乡村沃土，枝桠尽兴舒展，

        惊涛拍岸，唤醒心底悸颤。

        风帆卷起，远行人入土为安，

        船只远航，迎风扬起长帆。





        4．狭仄亲切， 那处农家小院，

        松树环绕， 枝干点缀苍翠，

        桃花开落， 未见果实的硕枝，

        井沿旁边， 青草茂密森然，

        花香难觅， 野性蔓延恣意，

        浑然天成， 乡土写满粗粝。



        5．难忘家乡， 至今无法忘怀，

        往事追忆， 点滴郁积胸间。

        藤蔓青青， 悄然爬满窗前，

        花香深处， 引来蝶舞蜂旋。

        路边黑莓， 芬芳令人心醉，

        林中夕阳， 谁家横笛缠绵？





        6．日作夜息，辛勤耕耘土地，

        春华秋实，丰足纯朴野趣，

        脚踏实地，采撷劳动收获，

        不会指望，天上掉落馅饼。

        落日长圆，岁月安宁静好，

        畅快人生，岂不称心如意？





        LESSON 107





THE VIRGINIANS


        弗吉尼亚人

        William Makepeace Thackeray (b. 1811, d. 1863). This popular English humorist, essayist, and novelist was born in Calcutta. He was educated at the Charterhouse school in London, and at Cambridge, but he did not complete a collegiate course of study. He began his literary career as a contributor to “Fraser’s Magazine,” under the assumed name of Michael Angelo Titmarsh, and afterwards contributed to the column of “Punch.” The first novel published under Thackeray’s own name was “Vanity Fair,” which is regarded by many as his greatest work. He afterwards wrote a large number of novels, tales, and poems, most of which were illustrated by sketches drawn by himself. His course of “Lectures on the English Humorists” was delivered in London in 1851, and the following year in several cities in the United States. He revisited the United States in 1856, and delivered a course of lectures on “The Four Georges,” which he repeated in Great Britain soon after his return home. In 1860 he became the editor of “The Cornhill Magazine,” the most successful serial ever published in England.





        1. Mr. Esmond called his American house Castlewood, from the patrimonial[7] home in the old country. The whole usages of Virginia, indeed, were fondly modeled after the English customs. It was a loyal colony. The Virginians boasted that King Charles the Second had been king in Virginia before he had been king in England. English king and English church were alike faithfully honored there.

        2. The resident gentry were allied to good English families. They held their heads above the Dutch traders of New York, and the money-getting Roundheads of Pennsylvania and New England. Never were people less republican than those of the great province which was soon to be foremost in the memorable revolt against the British Crown.



        3. The gentry of Virginia dwelt on their great lands after a fashion almost patriarchal. For its rough cultivation, each estate had a multitude of hands—of purchased and assigned servants— who were subject to the command of the master. The land yielded their food, live stock, and game.

        4. The great rivers swarmed with fish for the taking. From their banks the passage home was clear. Their ships took the tobacco off their private wharves on the banks of the Potomac or the James River, and carried it to London or Bristol,—bringing back English goods and articles of home manufacture in return for the only produce which the Virginian gentry chose to cultivate.

        5. Their hospitality was boundless. No stranger was ever sent away from their gates. The gentry received one another, and traveled to each other’s houses, in a state almost feudal. The question of slavery was not born at the time of which we write. To be the proprietor of black servants shocked the feelings of no Virginia gentleman; nor, in truth, was the despotism exercised over the negro race generally a savage one. The food was plenty: the poor black people lazy and not unhappy. You might have preached negro emancipation to Madam Esmond of Castlewood as you might have told her to let the horses run loose out of the stables; she had no doubt but that the whip and the corn bag were good for both.



              6. Her father may have thought otherwise, being of a skeptical turn on very many points, but his doubts did not break forth in active denial, and he was rather disaffected[8] than rebellious, At one period, this gentleman had taken a part in active life at home, and possibly might have been eager to share its rewards; but in latter days he did not seem to care for them. A something had occurred in his life, which had cast a tinge of melancholy over all his existence.

        7. He was not unhappy,—to those about him most kind,—most affectionate, obsequious[9] even to the women of his family, whom he scarce ever contradicted; but there had been some bankruptcy of his heart, which his spirit never recovered. He submitted to life, rather than enjoyed it, and never was in better spirits than in his last hours when he was going to lay it down.

        8. When the boys’ grandfather died, their mother, in great state, proclaimed her eldest son George her successor and heir of the estate; and Harry, George’s younger brother by half an hour, was always enjoined to respect his senior. All the household was equally instructed to pay him honor; the negroes, of whom there was a large and happy family, and the assigned servants from Europe, whose lot was made as bearable as it might be under the government of the lady of Castlewood.

        9. In the whole family there scarcely was a rebel save Mrs. Esmond’s faithful friend and companion, Madam Mountain, and Harry’s foster mother, a faithful negro woman, who never could be made to understand why her child should not be first, who was handsomer, and stronger, and cleverer than his brother, as she vowed; though, in truth, there was scarcely any difference in the beauty, strength, or stature of the twins.

        10. In disposition, they were in many points exceedingly unlike; but in feature they resembled each other so closely, that, but for the color of their hair, it had been difficult to distinguish them. In their beds, and when their heads were covered with those vast, ribboned nightcaps, which our great and little ancestors wore, it was scarcely possible for any but a nurse or a mother to tell the one from the other child.

        11. Howbeit, alike in form, we have said that they differed in temper. The elder was peaceful, studious, and silent; the younger was warlike and noisy. He was quick at learning when he began, but very slow at beginning. No threats of the ferule would provoke Harry to learn in an idle fit, or would prevent George from helping his brother in his lesson. Harry was of a strong military turn, drilled the little negroes on the estate, and caned them like a corporal, having many good boxing matches with them, and never bearing malice if he was worsted;—whereas George was sparing of blows, and gentle with all about him.

        12. As the custom in all families was, each of the boys had a special little servant assigned him: and it was a known fact that George, finding his little wretch of a blackamoor[10] asleep on his master’s bed, sat down beside it, and brushed the flies off the child with a feather fan, to the horror of old Gumbo, the child’s father, who found his young master so engaged, and to the indignation of Madam Esmond, who ordered the young negro off to the proper officer for a whipping. In vain George implored and entreated— burst into passionate tears, and besought a remission of the sentence. His mother was inflexible regarding the young rebel’s punishment, and the little negro went off beseeching his young master not to cry.



              13. On account of a certain apish drollery and humor which exhibited itself in the lad, and a liking for some of the old man’s pursuits, the first of the twins was the grandfather’s favorite and companion, and would laugh and talk out all his infantine heart to the old gentleman, to whom the younger had seldom a word to say.

        14. George was a demure, studious boy, and his senses seemed to brighten up in the library, where his brother was so gloomy. He knew the books before he could well-nigh carry them, and read in them long before he could understand them. Harry, on the other hand, was all alive in the stables or in the wood, eager for all parties of hunting and fishing, and promised to be a good sportsman from a very early age.

        15. At length the time came when Mr. Esmond was to have done with the affairs of this life, and he laid them down as if glad to be rid of their burden. All who read and heard that discourse, wondered where Parson Broadbent of James Town found the eloquence and the Latin which adorned it. Perhaps Mr. Dempster knew, the boys’ Scotch tutor, who corrected the proofs of the oration, which was printed, by the desire of his Excellency and many persons of honor, at Mr. Franklin’s press in Philadelphia.

        16. No such sumptuous funeral had ever been seen in the country as that which Madam Esmond Warrington ordained for her father, who would have been the first to smile at that pompous grief.

        17. The little lads of Castlewood, almost smothered in black trains and hatbands, headed the procession and were followed by my Lord Fairfax, from Greenway Court, by his Excellency the Governor of Virginia (with his coach), by the Randolphs, the Careys, the Harrisons, the Washingtons, and many others; for the whole country esteemed the departed gentleman, whose goodness, whose high talents, whose benevolence and unobtrusive urbanity[11], had earned for him the just respect of his neighbors.

        18. When informed of the event, the family of Colonel Esmond’s stepson, the Lord Castlewood of Hampshire in England, asked to be at the charges of the marble slab which recorded the names and virtues of his lordship’s mother and her husband; and after due time of preparation, the monument was set up, exhibiting the arms and coronet of the Esmonds, supported by a little, chubby group of weeping cherubs, and reciting an epitaph[12] which for once did not tell any falsehoods.

        威廉•梅克皮斯•萨克雷( 1811～1863)，这位英国极受欢迎的幽默作家、散文家及小说家出生于印度加尔各答市，他曾在伦敦查特豪斯学校和剑桥大学接受教育，然而并未完成他的大学学业。作为《弗雷泽》杂志的写稿人，萨克雷以米歇尔•安吉洛•泰特马斯为笔名开始了他的文学生涯，后来为《重击》 杂志撰写专栏。他第一部以萨克雷本名发表的小说《名利场》，被公认为他最为优秀的小说。后来，他又撰写了大量小说、故事和诗歌，书中大多插图皆为他亲手绘作。1851年，萨克雷《关于英国幽默家讲座》一书在伦敦出版；翌年，在美国数座城市发行。1856年，萨克雷再度访问美国，与此同时，他的《四个乔治》讲座教程问世；返回英国后，他随即出版该书。1860年，他成为《康希尔》杂志编辑，这部杂志为当时英国最为成功的期刊出版物。





        1.埃斯蒙德先生将他的美国房产称为卡斯尔伍德庄园，那是坐落于乡间的一处世袭家产。作为殖民地的弗吉尼亚州无不热衷效仿大英帝国诸多习俗，对英国皇室极尽效忠。弗吉尼亚人甚至不惜吹嘘，在英国登基前，国王查理二世已在弗吉尼亚州被拥戴为王，英国国王及英国教会在本州受到的敬畏丝毫不亚于英国本土民众的虔诚信奉。

        2.弗吉尼亚州贵族家族大可追溯到英国上流社会的背景渊源，这些贵族家庭纷纷将家族显赫的祖先头像悬挂起来，炫耀地挂在那些纽约市荷兰商人的头顶上端，挂在那些宾夕法尼亚州及新英格兰地区捞钱的圆颅党人的头顶上端。与那些大省相比，该州拥戴共和政体的民众绝不会少，在反抗英国宗主国统治的难忘战争中，这点随后显示弗吉尼亚州的至关重要。

        3.弗吉尼亚州贵族世家承袭的地产通常颇为可观，他们遵循近乎家族式的管理模式，这种模式简单粗放，每户庄园人手丰裕，包括那些买来的黑奴还有指派做活的固定奴仆。那些仆从服从主人的调遣掌控，而土地则为其提供食物、牲畜以及享乐性庞杂需求。

        4.弗吉尼亚州内河鱼类资源极为丰富，水路畅达通衢方便，往来穿梭的船只从波多马克河或詹姆士河的私家码头运走烟叶，直抵伦敦或布里斯托尔，然后回程运回英国各类居家用度，那些该州名望家族视其为可熏陶其家族子女贵族气质的众多商品。

        5.弗吉尼亚州贵族世家的豪爽待客令人称奇，他们不会打发上门的陌生人，在几乎完全封建制的全州境内，上流家庭彼此经常设宴款待，达官名媛争相登门互访。当时奴隶制问题尚未见争端，该州贵族世家拥有众多黑奴，使得贵族名流圈外的下层阶层颇为震惊，事实上，那类专制管理未必将黑人种族作为野蛮人肆意欺凌。当地黑人食物充足，他们贫困懒惰，也并非不快乐。你或许向卡斯尔伍德庄园埃斯蒙德夫人兜售过黑奴解放之类新潮思想，如同你曾经对她游说，不妨解开拴马桩上的马群缰绳，两者间该有异曲同工之妙。倘若鞭子或玉米对主人及黑奴并非缺一不可，埃斯蒙德夫人没准对你的观点深信不疑。

        6.由于对诸多观点持怀疑态度，埃斯蒙德夫人的父亲想法或见解有所不同，但他的怀疑不会在主动否认中爆发，与其说他的行为颇为格格不入，倒不如说是更为愤懑不平的表露。有一段时期，这位绅士在家里极为活跃，很可能他急于分享家庭管理之类悬赏，但后来似乎对此又失去兴趣。假如他生活中发生什么事，他的全身都会留下阴郁味道。



              7.老绅士倒不是不开心，对周围所有人，他都极为仁慈钟爱，甚至到了顺从附和的地步，哪怕对家里女流之辈亦不例外。他极少与她们发生牴牾或产生矛盾，然而始终内心沉沦、难以自拔，精神上从未彻底放松。老人逆来顺受地屈从生活，而非自在地享受生活；即便死亡将至，不得不撒手尘寰面对死神，他的心境绝不见得比平时更糟。

        8.男孩们的祖父最终去世后，他们的母亲威风凛凛地在全庄园郑重宣布，她的大儿子乔治为她的继任者以及财产继承人；半小时后，乔治的弟弟哈里接到需要认可乔治地位的授意，全家上下无一例外必须尊重乔治的权威，包括那些人口众多、幸福和睦的黑人家庭，还有那些来自欧洲指派的固定奴仆，一干人命运当然以对卡斯尔伍德庄园女主人绝对服从为基本前提。

        9.全家几乎所有人都对埃斯蒙德夫人唯唯诺诺，鲜少的反驳之声来自夫人的忠实朋友兼伴友蒙顿夫人，还有哈里的继母，那位忠心耿耿的黑女人。她从未弄清楚，为什么她的哈里在家里不该排第一？哈里相貌英俊，身体健壮结实，比他的哥哥聪明活络，这一点，那位黑人奶母甚至赌咒发誓，事实上，尽管就相貌、体格或身材而言，这双胞胎兄弟几乎无法分辨。

        10.至于性情方面，两兄弟行为举止显然大相径庭。单从外貌特征来看，兄弟俩实在过于相像，如果不是头发颜色的差异，外人的确很难分清兄弟俩；如果晚上兄弟俩上床，戴上家族先人们曾佩戴的那种硕大无朋的缎带睡帽，那么，除保姆或妈妈，几乎没人能够辨认出这对宝贝。

        11.正如方才提到的，两人长相雷同，脾气秉性则迥异不同。老大平和好学且沉默寡言，老二则挑衅好战，沉湎嬉闹。每每开始学习，他反应很快；一旦进入课程便显得格外鲁钝。来自戒尺的惩戒对游手好闲的哈里无济于事；同时，亦无法阻止乔治协助弟弟躲避用功。哈里的军事悟性极高，他习惯模仿军官，居然有模有样地训练庄园一批黑人少年，经常习惯模仿军士用藤杖鞭打那些少年，或与他们进行激烈的拳击竞赛，即使被打趴在地，哈里断然亦不会心怀恶意或萌生怨恨；相反，乔治从不与人殴斗，对人总是温和友善。

        12.像当地所有贵族家庭一样，每个贵族男孩都有专门伺童跟从伺候，乔治有件轶事在当地无人不晓。一天，乔治发现自己伺童居然在他这个主人的床上睡着了，他一声不吭地在床边坐下，拿起一把羽毛扇给那个小坏蛋撵蚊虫；让孩子爸爸、老黑奴甘博万分恐惧的是，眼前儿子的年轻主子手脚一直忙活不停。埃斯蒙德夫人知道此事后恼怒万分，她即刻吩咐撵走那小坏蛋去接受鞭刑。乔治的祈求全然无用，竟然在旁边嚎啕大哭起来，他苦苦哀求母亲赦免他的仆从，当然，埃斯蒙德夫人压根不会放过对这个黑色小反骨的惩罚，那位小伺童却走上前恳求他的小主人不要哭泣。



              13.抖落乔治身上的诙谐笑料，令人忍俊不禁。这个半大小子喜爱似乎与祖父嗜好有些不谋而合，乔治还喜欢和老人袒露孩子的小秘密。童言无忌的纯真，使他成为老人的心头肉和忘年交，而乔治喜欢和老人尽情袒露孩童的小秘密。弟弟哈里则与祖父几乎无话可说。

        14.乔治学习严肃认真，一进入知识海洋，便显现出惊人天赋；捧起书本的哈里，总是蔫头耷脑，满脸愁容。乔治小时候，甚至在无法明白文章内容的时候，他便喜欢上了书，早早开始阅读；此刻的哈里成天活蹦乱跑，不是在马厩或树林里搅得鸡飞狗跳，就是屁颠颠地钓鱼打猎聚众喧闹，从小便信誓旦旦地声称自己将会成为优秀的体育健将。

         15.死神降临，埃斯蒙德先生即将告别人世，庄园一干世俗杂务业已与他无关，对他来说，如释重负的解脱似乎意味着内心欣慰无比。凡是读过或听过埃斯蒙德先生祭文的人，对詹姆斯镇德本特牧师究竟从哪找到这么一篇流利完美、不时缀有庄重典雅拉丁文的祭文心存疑惑。登普斯特先生或许深谙其中奥秘，这位乔治与哈里的苏格兰家庭老师想必对那篇祭文最后润笔。这篇祭文依照国王阁下的本人意愿，另外鉴于诸多贤士名流的荣誉考虑，最终在费城富兰克林先生出版社得以印出。

        16.有史以来，弗吉尼亚全州从未经历过如此奢华盛大的送葬，沃林顿•埃斯蒙德夫人授权为她的父亲操办的这场葬礼，冲着这场炫耀于世的风光，那位离去的逝者恐怕最先笑出声来。

        17.卡斯尔伍德家族两位少年身穿黑色曳尾礼服，戴着缀有黑色缎带的礼帽，走在送葬队伍前列，心情压抑得几乎喘不过气来。少年身后跟随有格林威法院的费尔法克斯勋爵、尊贵的弗吉尼亚州州长阁下（乘坐他的四轮马车赶来）、伦道夫夫妇、卡雷斯夫妇、哈里森斯夫妇、华盛顿夫妇以及众多宾客。全州对这位逝去的名流之士致以敬意，埃斯蒙德先生的良好美德、出众才华、仁慈宽厚以及不事张扬的温文尔雅赢得了周边居民的恰当尊重。

        18.埃斯蒙德先生的上校继子，英国汉普郡卡斯尔伍德勋爵一家接到这一不幸的消息，并被要求承担继父大理石墓碑的所有费用，碑上镌刻母亲的勋爵身份与她丈夫的贵族头衔，还有夫妇俩的一生善行。经过一段时间准备，那块纪念碑已矗立起来，碑面刻有埃斯蒙德夫妇戎装照与爵位冕冠，下面衬有一排胖乎乎的哭泣小天使，小家伙们正在朗诵这篇未见任何漏洞谎言的墓志铭。





        LESSON 108





MINOT’S LEDGE


        迈诺特的利奇

        Fitz-James O’Brien (b. 1828, d. 1862) was of Irish birth, and came to America in 1852. He has contributed a number of tales and poems to various periodicals, but his writings have never been collected in book form. Mr. O’Brien belonged to the New York Seventh Regiment, and died at Baltimore of a wound received in a cavalry skirmish.





        1. Like spectral hounds across the sky,

        The white clouds scud before the storm;

        And naked in the howling night

        The red-eyed lighthouse lifts its form.

        The waves with slippery fingers clutch

        The massive tower, and climb and fall,

        And, muttering, growl with baffled rage

        Their curses on the sturdy wall.





        2. Up in the lonely tower he sits,

        The keeper of the crimson light:

        Silent and awe-struck does he hear

        The imprecations of the night.

        The white spray beats against the panes

        Like some wet ghost that down the air

        Is hunted by a troop of fiends,

        And seeks a shelter anywhere.





        3. He prays aloud, the lonely man,

        For every soul that night at sea,

        But more than all for that brave boy

        Who used to gayly climb his knee,—

        Young Charlie, with his chestnut hair,

        And hazel eyes, and laughing lip.

        “May Heaven look down,” the old man cries.

        “Upon my son, and on his ship!”





        4. While thus with pious heart he prays,

        Far in the distance sounds a boom:

        He pauses; and again there rings

        That sullen thunder through the room.



              A ship upon the shoals to-night!

        She cannot hold for one half hour;

        But clear the ropes and grappling hooks,

        And trust in the Almighty Power!





        5. On the drenched gallery he stands,

        Striving to pierce the solid night:

        Across the sea the red eye throws

        A steady crimson wake of light;

        And, where it falls upon the waves,

        He sees a human head float by,

        With long drenched curls of chestnut hair,

        And wild but fearless hazel eye.





        6. Out with the hooks! One mighty fling!

        Adown the wind the long rope curls.

        Oh! will it catch? Ah, dread suspense!

        While the wild ocean wilder whirls.

        A steady pull; it tightens now:

        Oh! his old heart will burst with joy,

        As on the slippery rocks he pulls

        The breathing body of his boy.





        7. Still sweep the specters through the sky;

        Still scud the clouds before the storm;

        Still naked in the howling night

        The red-eyed lighthouse lifts its form.

        Without, the world is wild with rage;

        Unkenneled demons are abroad;

        But with the father and the son

        Within, there is the peace of God.

        LESSON 109





HAMLET


        哈姆雷特

         William Shakespeare (b. 1564, d. 1616), by many regarded as the greatest poet the world has ever produced, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was married, when very young, to a woman eight years his senior, went to London, was joint proprietor of Blackfriar’s Theater in 1589, wrote poems and plays, was an actor, accumulated some property, and retired to Stratford three or four years before his death. He was buried in Stratford church, where a monument has been erected to his memory. This is all that is known of him with any degree of certainty. Shakespeare’s works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. They show a wonderful knowledge of human nature, expressed in language remarkable for its point and beauty.





        (ACT I, SCENE II. HAMLET alone in a room, of the castle. Enter

        HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.)





        Hor. Hail, to your lordship!

        Ham. I am glad to see you well:

         Horatio,—or I do forgot myself.

        Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

        Ham. Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you:

         And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—Macellus?

        Mar. My good lord—

        Ham. I am very glad to see you. [To Ber.] Good even, sir.

         But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

        Hor. A truant[13] disposition, good my lord.

        Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,

         Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,

         To make it truster[14] of your own report

         Against yourself: I knew you are no truant.

         But what is your affair in Elsinore?

         We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

        Hor. My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.

        Ham. I pray thee, do not mock me, follow-student;

         I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.

        Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

        Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats

         Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.



               Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

         Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

         My father!—methinks I see my father.

        Hor. Where, my lord?

        Ham. In my mind’s eye, Horatio.

        Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

        Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all,

         I shall not look upon his like again.

         Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

         Ham. Saw? who?

         Hor. My lord, the king your father.

        Ham. The king my father!

        Hor.· Season your admiration for a while

         With an attent[15] ear, till I may deliver[16],

         Upon the witness of these gentlemen,

         This marvel to you.





              Ham. For God’s love, let me hear.

        Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen,

         Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,

         In the dead vast and middle of the night,

         Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,

         Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie[17].

         Appears before them, and with solemn march

         Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d

         By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,

         Within his trucheon’s[18] length; whilst they, distill’d

         Almost to jelly with the act of fear,

         Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me

         In dreadful secrecy impart they did;

         And I with them the third night kept the watch:

         Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,

         Form of the thing, each word made true and good,

         The apparition comes: I knew your father;

         These hands are not more like.

        Ham. But where was this?

        Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch’d.

        Ham. Did you speak to it?

        Hor. My lord, I did;

         But answer made it none: yet once methought

         It lifted up its head and did address

         Itself to motion, like as it would speak;

         But even then the morning cock crew loud,

         And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,

         And vanish’d from our sight.

        Ham. ’T is very strange.

        Hor. As I do live, my honor’d lord, ’t is true;

         And we did think it writ down in our duty

         To let you know of it.

        Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me,

         Hold you the watch to-night?

        Mar.

         We do, my lord.

        Ber.



        Ham. Arm’d, say you?

        Mar.



         Arm’d, my lord.

        Ber.



        Ham. From top to toe?

        Mar.



         My lord, from head to foot.

        Ber.





              }



              }



              }



              Ham. Then saw you not his face?

        Hor. Oh, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver[19] up.

        Ham. What, look’d he frowningly?

        Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

        Ham. Pale or red?

        Hor. Nay, very pale.

        Ham. And fix’d his eyes upon you?

        Hor. Most constantly.

        Ham. I would I had been there.

        Hor. It would have much amazed you.

        Ham. Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?

        Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

        Mar.

         Longer, longer.

        Ber.

        Hor. Not when I saw’t.

        Ham. His beard was grizzled,—no?

        Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,

         A sable silver’d.

        Ham. I will watch to-night;

         Perchance ’t will walk again.

        Hor. I warrant it will.

        Ham. If it assume my noble father’s person,

         I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape

         And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,

         If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,

         Let it be tenable[20] in your silence still;

         And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,

         Give it an understanding, but no tongue:

         I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:

         Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,

         I’ll visit you.

              （第一幕，第二场。哈姆雷特单独在城堡一间屋内。霍瑞修、马塞勒斯与勃那多同上）





        霍瑞修：向您致敬，陛下！

        哈姆雷特：你身体很好，见到你很高兴。你是霍瑞修？或许我记忆有误。

        霍瑞修：没错，陛下，正是您谦卑的仆人。

        哈姆雷特：不，我的好朋友，我倒希望与你不受地位名分之拘。霍瑞修，你怎么从威登堡回来了？马塞勒斯呢？

        马塞勒斯：在，陛下——

        哈姆雷特：（对勃那多）见到你真高兴，晚上好，朋友，不过，坦诚地说来，你为何要离开威登堡？

        霍瑞修：不过开开小差而已，尊贵的陛下。

        哈姆雷特：但愿你的仇家不要用这样借口来搪塞，你也别用这样话来刺我，你的言不由衷只会使你愈发尴尬，我知道，你本不是闲散懒惰之徒，可你来埃尔西诺有何公干？这么说来，在你动身之前，我们真该和你好好地喝上几杯。

        霍瑞修：陛下，我来参加您父王的葬礼。

        哈姆雷特：拜托，请别取笑，小伙子，恐怕你是来参加我母后的婚礼吧？

        霍瑞修：当然，陛下， 这两桩事确实前后相近。

        哈姆雷特：霍瑞修！从葬礼上撤下的杯羹残酒，再度款待参加婚宴的八方宾客，这可真够节俭便捷。我宁可与此生血海深仇的仇家相遇天堂，亦不愿亲眼看着那个日子来临，霍瑞修！我的父王，我似乎看见他了。

        霍瑞修：在哪里？陛下。

        哈姆雷特：在我的心灵之眼，霍瑞修。

        霍瑞修：我见过他一次，一位慈爱君王。

        哈姆雷特：父王是位真正的男子汉；总而言之，恐怕以后再亦难以遇见这样伟岸尊贵的君王。

        霍瑞修：陛下，我想说，我昨天晚上见到他了。

        哈姆雷特：你见到谁？

        霍瑞修：陛下，我见到您的父王。

        哈姆雷特：我的父王？

        霍瑞修：陛下无需惊讶，在场两位可以见证，且等我将这件奇异的事细说与您听。



              哈姆雷特：圣父在上，快说。

        霍瑞修：连续两个夜晚，马塞勒斯与勃那多一起在皇宫守夜，夜半三更，周围一片寂静，一个好像你父王的高大身影，出现在他们面前。那魂灵全身披着胄甲，从头至脚，它的步伐威严缓慢，从他们身边走过三次。当时的马塞勒斯与勃那多错愕不已，那魂灵手中的廷杖甚至差点触到他们身上；他俩魂魄飞散，呆若木鸡，吓得一句话也说不出来。万分恐惧中，他们向我透露了实情，于是，第三天晚上，我就过来与他们一起守夜。果然不出所料，那魂灵又来了，它出现的时间还有身影与马塞勒斯与勃那多描述得竟然不差分毫。我见过您的父王，那魂灵模样与您的父王委实无异。

        哈姆雷特：在什么地方？

        马塞勒斯：陛下，就在我们守夜的平台上。

        哈姆雷特：你们与它说话吗？

        霍瑞修：陛下，我问话了，可它没有回应；可我觉得，那魂灵当时好像抬起头，刚想开口说话，可偏巧那时，晨鸡鸣叫起来，那魂灵听见鸡鸣声，转眼间便隐遁不见了。

        哈姆雷特：这事可真够鬼怪灵异。

        霍瑞修：尊贵的陛下，此事千真万确，我敢以性命担保；我们有责任让您知晓实情。

        哈姆雷特：很好，真的，朋友们，不过我对这事依然心存疑惑，今晚你们还去守夜？

        马塞勒斯：



        勃那多： 是的，陛下。



        哈姆雷特：你们说那魂灵穿着胄甲？

        马塞勒斯：



        勃那多： 是的，陛下。



        哈姆雷特：全身披挂？

        马塞勒斯：

        勃那多： 从头至脚，陛下。



        哈姆雷特：那你们没看清那魂灵的脸吗？

        霍瑞修：哦，我看见了，陛下；它揭起了脸上盔甲。

        哈姆雷特：它愁眉紧锁吗？

        霍瑞修：它的脸上悲伤胜过愤怒。



              }



              }



              }



              哈姆雷特：脸色惨白或是红润？

        霍瑞修：满脸惨白。

        哈姆雷特：它盯着你看吗？

        霍瑞修：几乎一直盯着。

        哈姆雷特：如果我当时在场，那该多好。

        霍瑞修：您会惊悚万分的。

        哈姆雷特：确实，差不多如此。那魂灵盘桓多久？

        霍瑞修：估计从一数到一百，大体的平均速度吧。

        马塞勒斯：

        勃那多： 还要再长点，再长点。



        霍瑞修：我看见的时候，应该这样。

        哈姆雷特：那魂灵胡须花白还是黑色？

        霍瑞修：我当时所见，与国王生前一样，黑色胡须中夹杂少许白色。

        哈姆雷特：我今晚也去守夜，或许那魂灵还会再来。

        霍瑞修：我相信，它会出来的。

        哈姆雷特：倘若那魂灵以我尊贵的父王形象出现，我要与它说话，哪怕地狱裂开，撒旦令我噤言。如果你们尚未将你们所见告知他人，不妨依然保持缄默，我会感念你们。无论今晚情况如何，谨记在心，万不可逞口舌之强，你们的忠诚会有回报。好了，再见。今晚十一点到十二点之间，我会登临平台一查究竟。

        LESSON 110





DISSERTATION ON ROAST PIG


        论烤猪

        Charles Lamb (b. 1775, d. 1834) was born in London. He was educated at Christ’s Hospital, where he was a schoolfellow and intimate friend of Coleridge. In 1792 he became a clerk in the India House, London, and in 1825 he retired from his clerkship on a pension of ￡441. Lamb never married, but devoted his life to the care of his sister Mary, who was at times insane. He wrote “Tales founded on the Plays of Shakespeare,” and several other works of rare merit; but his literary fame rests principally on the inimitable “Essays of Elia” (published originally in the “London Magazine”), from one of which the following selection is adapted.

        1. Mankind, says a Chinese manuscript, which my friend M. was obliging enough to read and explain to me, for the first seventy thousand ages ate their meat raw, clawing or biting it from the living animal, just as they do in Abyssinia to this day.

        2. This period is not obscurely hinted at by their great Confucius in the second chapter of his “Mundane Mutations,” where he designates a kind of golden age by the term Cho-fang, literally the Cooks’ Holiday. The manuscript goes on to say that the art of roasting, or rather broiling (which I take to be the elder brother), was accidentally discovered in the manner following:

        3. The swineherd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the woods one morning, as his manner was, to collect mast for his hogs, left his cottage in the care of his eldest son, Bo-bo, a great lubberly boy, who, being fond of playing with fire, as younkers[21] of his age commonly are, let some sparks escape into a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly, spread the conflagration over every part of their poor mansion till it was reduced to ashes.

        4. Together with the cottage,—a sorry, antediluvian[22] makeshift[23] of a building, you may think it,—what was of much more importance, a fine litter of newborn pigs, no less than nine in number, perished. China pigs have been esteemed a luxury all over the East from the remotest periods we read of.

        5. Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may think, not so much for the sake of the tenement, which his father and he could easily build up again with a few dry branches, and the labor of an hour or two, at any time, as for the loss of the pigs. While he was thinking what he should say to his father, and wringing his hands over the smoking remnants of one of those untimely sufferers, an odor assailed his nostrils unlike any scent which he had before experienced.



              6. What, could it proceed from? Not from the burnt cottage,— he had smelt that smell before,—indeed, this was by no means the first accident of the kind which had occurred through the negligence of this unlucky young firebrand. Much less did it resemble that of any known herb, weed, or flower. A premonitory[24] moistening at the same time overflowed his nether lip. He knew not what to think.

        7. He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were any signs of life in it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them he applied them in his booby fashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin had come away with his fingers, and for the first time in his life (in the world’s life, indeed, for before him no man had known it) he tasted—crackling! Again he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much now; still he licked his fingers from a sort of habit.

        8. The truth at length broke into his slow understanding that it was the pig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so delicious; and surrendering himself up to the newborn pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls of the scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire entered amid the smoking rafters, armed with a retributory[25] cudgel, and, finding how affairs stood, began to rain blows upon the young rogue’s shoulders as thick as hailstones, which Bo-bo heeded not any more than if they had been flies.

        9. His father might lay on, but he could not beat him from his pig till he had fairly made an end of it, when, becoming a little more sensible of his situation, something like the following dialogue ensued:

        “You graceless whelp, what have you got there devouring? Is it not enough that you have burnt me down three houses with your dog’s tricks, and be hanged to you! but you must be eating fire, and I know not what? What have you got there, I say?”

        “O father, the pig, the pig! do come and taste how nice the burnt pig eats!”

        10. The ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed his son, and he cursed himself that he should ever have a son that should eat burnt pig.

        Bo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since morning, soon raked out another pig, and, fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser half by main force into the fists of Ho-ti, still shouting out, “Eat, eat, eat the burnt pig, father! only taste! Oh!” with such like barbarous ejaculations, cramming all the while as if he would choke.

        11. Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the abominable thing, wavering whether he should not put his son to death for an unnatural young monster, when the crackling scorching his fingers, as it had done his son’s, and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn tasted some of its flavor, which, make what sour mouths he would for a pretense, proved not altogether displeasing to him. In conclusion (for the manuscript here is a little tedious), both father and son fairly sat down to the mess, and never left off till they had dispatched all that remained of the litter.



              12. Bo-bo was strictly enjoined[26] not to let the secret escape, for the neighbors would certainly have stoned them for a couple of abominable wretches, who could think of improving upon the good meat which God had sent them. Nevertheless strange stories got about. It was observed that Ho-ti’s cottage was burnt down now more frequently than ever. Nothing but fires from this time forward. Some would break out in broad day, others in the nighttime; and Ho-ti himself, which was the more remarkable, instead of chastising his son, seemed to grow more indulgent to him than ever.

        13. At length they were watched, the terrible mystery discovered, and father and son summoned to take their trial at Pekin, then an inconsiderable assize town. Evidence was given, the obnoxious[27] food itself produced in court, and verdict about to be pronounced, when the foreman of the jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of which the culprits stood accused, might be handed into the box.

        14. He handled it, and they all handled it; and burning their fingers, as Bo-bo and his father had done before them, and nature prompting to each of them the same remedy, against the face of all the facts, and the clearest charge which the judge had ever given,—to the surprise of the whole court, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, and all present,—without leaving the box, or any manner of consultation whatever, they brought in a simultaneous verdict of “Not Guilty.”

        15. The judge, who was a shrewd fellow, winked at the manifest iniquity of the decision; and when the court was dismissed, went privily, and bought up all the pigs that could be had for love or money. In a few days his lordship’s townhouse was observed to be on fire.

        16. The thing took wing, and now there was nothing to be seen but fire in every direction. Fuel and pigs grew enormously dear all over the district. The insurance offices one and all shut up shop. People built slighter and slighter every day, until it was feared that the very science of architecture would in no long time be lost to the world.

        17. Thus this custom of firing houses continued till in process of time, says my manuscript, a sage arose, like our Locke, who made a discovery that the flesh of swine, or indeed of any other animal, might be cooked (burnt, as they called it) without the necessity of consuming a whole house to dress it.

        18. Then first began the rude form of a gridiron. Roasting by the string or spit came in a century or two later; I forget in whose dynasty[28]. By such slow degrees, concludes the manuscript, do the most useful, and seemingly the most obvious, arts make their way among mankind.

        19. Without placing too implicit[29] faith in the account above given, it must be agreed that if a worthy pretext for so dangerous an experiment as setting houses on fire (especially in these days) could be assigned in favor of any culinary[30] object that pretext and excuse might be found in Roast Pig.

        查尔斯 · 兰姆（1775～1834）出生于英国伦敦。兰姆在基督医学院接受教育，与诗人柯尔律治同校，且一生与其交往甚密。1792年，兰姆成为伦敦东印度公司职员；1825年退休，享有441英镑年金。兰姆终生未曾婚娶，但倾其一生照料他的姐姐玛丽，玛丽罹患精神错乱，时常发作不堪折磨。兰姆《莎士比亚戏剧故事集》引起广泛关注，不过，他的其他一些作品较为平庸；兰姆文学声誉主要为其别具一格的《伊利亚随笔》（该文最早发表在《伦敦杂志》），以下段落来自他其中一篇删节。





        1.我的朋友老麦，曾经好心地为我朗读一本中国古代手抄书，并辅以解释，那本书上说，最早七万年前的人类尚为生番族，他们大啖生肉，从活物身上撕扯或啮咬血淋淋的肉来充饥，与当今蒙昧落后的埃塞俄比亚人堪有一比。

        2.在中国伟大的孔夫子《春秋》一书第二章节中，孔夫子清晰地用“庖房” 词语将那一远古时期定为黄金时代，“庖房”文字上意指厨师的庆典。书中认为烘烤，或者毋庸说烧烤手艺（我觉得后者应率先采用），不过是人类不经意的发现，或许经过应该这样：

        3.有一天，霍逖猪倌清晨离家走进森林，如同往常那样，给家里猪猡采摘橡树果实，留下他的儿子波波看家。愚笨冥顽的儿子波波喜欢玩火，远古荒蛮年代的孩子大多有此嗜好，于是，火星点点遽然从草堆里冒出，很快燃成一片熊熊烈火。大火迅速地舔舐那间狭小茅舍，直到将其彻底化为灰烬。

        4.不妨设想一下，当时原始人的眼里迫切需要，究竟一间远古大洪水前破陋窝棚，抑或一窝生下不久、数量不少于九只的活泼猪崽孰重孰轻？什么窝棚，猪崽呀，统统在冲天大火中化为乌有。追溯到我们尚且可查的悠久记载中，中国猪一向堪为整个东方世界奢侈生活的象征。

        5.不难想象，波波当时的错愕不已，当然他并不担心那间糟糕茅屋；随便拈来三两根枯枝干柴，他与父亲只消花上一两个时辰就可重新铺盖完毕。让波波百般纠结的是，他如何向父亲大人交差，因此不停地摩挲双手，不知所措。眼前一具烧焦的猪崽冒出缕缕青烟，一股平生未曾闻到的香味扑鼻而来。

        6.天呀，究竟哪里飘来的香味？这味道不是来自灰烬尚存的茅屋，那位倒霉孩子的疏忽过失引起火灾频发，当然祝融绝非第一次光顾这间茅庵破窝；至于波波熟悉的那些花草植物，更是八竿子沾不上边；波波居然有了某种预感，他的涎水嗒嗒滴地流了下来，尽管眼前一切看来似乎懵懂未知。

        7.波波俯身弯腰摸了摸火中小猪，想看看是否猪崽还存有一丝气息，没想到蓦然缩回烫疼的手，于是愠恼地凑在嘴边猛吹；烤焦乳猪的零星碎屑碰巧沾到他的手指，于是，他平生第一次品咂到烤乳猪的焦脆美味（这也是人类有史以来第一次体验未曾品尝的口腹之妙）。波波再次探手摸了摸小猪，炙热的烤猪不再那么灼烫，他习惯地又吮吸了一下手指。



              8.此刻，一向迟钝的他突然醍醐灌顶，那种奇妙无比的醇香居然来自那只火中乳猪，焦脆的猪肉尝起来美味绵长，波波全身心沉湎于这一前所未有的快感中，索性尽兴地大块撕扯着那团乳猪，忙不迭地拼命往嘴里海吃乱塞。恰好这时，他老爸迈步走过尚且冒着余烟的椽木，手里提着一根杀威棒，看到惨不忍睹的家，雨点般的手起棒落，全部落到了倒霉蛋的波波身上。此时的波波吃得正欢，何曾理会老爸飞来的棍棒，美食当前的他，不过像被蚊蝇叮咬几口罢。

        9.怒火中烧的老爸棍棒不断，波波狼吞虎咽地咀嚼不停，直到将那只乳猪彻底消灭干净，这时波波似乎才略微明白眼前处境，接下来父子间没准有如下对话：

        “你这不知羞耻的狗崽子，你蹲在哪里吞吃什么？咱家房子给你烧光了三次，你这惹是生非的家伙，难道还没烧够？你这天杀的贱货！你在火里刨吃什么呀？我的天呀，你在吃什么东西？”

        “哎呀，老爸，是小猪，小猪呀！快来尝尝这好吃的小猪。”

        10.霍逖耳朵嗡嗡刺响，心中恐惧顿生，他骂骂咧咧地诅咒儿子，也责骂自己生了这么不争气的儿子，竟然敢吃烤焦的小猪。

        从早上开始，此时波波的嗅觉已是灵异过人，哗啦一声，居然又从火堆中摸扒出一只小猪，他猛地撕扯开，将小半份烤猪硬是塞到老爸的手中，还一边大声叫唤，“快吃，快吃，看看这烤焦的小猪，老爸，你先尝尝！我的妈呀！太好吃了。”波波粗鄙地兴奋喊叫，乐不可支地大嚼大咽，一时竟噎得说不出话来。

        11.霍逖怒气中烧，全身关节咯蹦作响，手里还端着一大坨烤猪，看着这个伤天害理的怪物，他犹豫是否将儿子弄死；炙热的烤猪突然烫到了他的手，如同当时儿子的手被灼疼一模一样，他也照旧用嘴吹了吹，因此顺理成章地品咂到焦脆美味的乳猪；他装模作样地撇撇嘴，看起来不以为然，其实内心完全不是那回事，末了（手抄本此处描述真有点冗长乏味），老爸和儿子在废墟前安然坐好，拉开架势饕餮一餐，直到将那窝猪崽风卷残云扫荡精光。

        12.波波得到父亲授意，万万不可对他人吐露半点风声，否则，父子两人将会视为卑鄙的邪恶之徒，死在左邻右舍的乱石棍棒之下；因为，在邻居们眼中，他们竟然随意改变上帝赏赐人类的血腥食物。然而，流言蜚语却在不胫而走。有人留意到，霍逖家窝棚隔三岔五便有祝融光顾，火灾似乎频繁起来；从那以后，火灾似乎压根就没消停过，而且一烧就烧个精光。有时青天白日莫名失火，有时夜半三更火灾光临，霍逖本人举止愈发让人狐疑，不仅不惩罚他的儿子，似乎愈发放任孩子屡屡纵火的恶行。



              13.最终，霍逖与波波受到严密监控，可怕的秘密终于真相大白，父子二人被传讯到北京严加审问，那时北京城规模要小得多，不过是个民间巡回审判的村落小镇。戴罪之人被带上庭堂，弥天大罪的证据亦被提交法庭，判决即将宣判之际，突然，审判团长老要求指控罪犯犯罪证据的烤猪当庭呈上，以验明核实。

        14.审判团长老伸手摸了摸烤乳猪，在座其他要员随之仿效，与波波与他老爸感受心同，大家都烫得缩回了手，下意识用嘴吹了吹灼痛之处。接下来，无视所有的事实证据，甚至法官提交法庭的犯罪清晰指控，包括聚众旁观的市井小民，过往路人，嚼舌之徒，以及所有在场者瞠目结舌的是，审判团成员没有离开法庭商讨，也未经任何磋商讨论，异口同声一致作出“无罪判决”。

        15.那位法庭长老级人物，显然精明过人，对法庭明显违规操作的判决深谙于心；待到散庭后，他悄悄买光所有的烤猪，这场交易称得上连买带送。不几天，法官大人官邸火光眼见红了半边天。

        16.这样稀罕之事简直像长了翅膀。这下好了，城里不时有此起彼伏的火光冒出，劈柴与猪崽价格眼见突突地涨个不停，保险当铺一家家倒闭关门；日复一日，居民窝棚越发粗制潦草，甚至有人开始担忧，这门盖房技艺无需良久就会失传，无人承继。

        17.于是，焚烧房屋的习俗延续下来，直到后来的文明进步才得以废除。一位类似西方洛克的圣人横空出世，我的那本手抄本如此描述，那位睿者发现，不管猪肉，还是其他动物的肉，无须点燃整座房屋，同样可通过烹制为食（或如中国人所说的炙烤）。

        18.由此，粗陋的食物烤架最先问世，一两百年后，成行成串的炙烤烹制方法开始流行，我可真忘了这些事发生在哪朝哪代。不过，那部手抄本给出以下结论，伴随缓慢的文明进步，那些人类生活中最为实用、似乎最为显见的生存技艺，就是这样逐渐地完善起来。

        19.无须对上述历史尘封过分当真，然而，对于那种放火燃尽茅舍窝棚的危险实验（尤其在原始蛮荒时期），我们还是深以为然；因为，如果说这类冒险价有所值，那么，烹饪史上的烤乳猪显然值得一书。





        LESSON 111





A PEN PICTURE


        北极光

        William Black (b. 1841,—-d.1898) is one of the leading modern novelist of England. The scenes of his stories are for the most part laid in Scotland, and he excels in the delineation of Scotch character. But his most remarkable power is seen in those vivid, poetical descriptions of scenery, of which the following selection, adapted from “The Princess of Thule,” is a good example. Mr. Black’s most noted works, in addition to the one named, are: “A Daughter of Heth,” “The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton,” “Kilmeny,” and “McLeod of Dare.”





        1. Lavender had already transformed Sheila into a heroine during the half hour of their stroll from the beach and around the house; and as they sat at dinner on this still, brilliant evening in summer, he clothed her in the garments of romance.

        2. Her father, with his great, gray beard and heavy brow, became the King of Thule, living in this solitary house overlooking the sea, and having memories of a dear sweetheart. His daughter, the Princess, had the glamour[31] of a thousand legends dwelling in her beautiful eyes; and when she walked by the shores of the Atlantic, that were now getting yellow under the sunset, what strange and unutterable thoughts must appear in the wonder of her face!

        3. After dinner they went outside and sat down on a bench in the garden. It was a cool and pleasant evening. The sun had gone down in red fire behind the Atlantic, and there was still left a rich glow of crimson in the west, while overhead, in the pale yellow of the sky, some filmy clouds of rose color lay motionless. How calm was the sea out there, and the whiter stretch of water coming into Loch[32] Roag! The cool air of the twilight was scented with sweetbrier. The wash of the ripples along the coast could be heard in the stillness.

        4. The girl put her hand on her father’s head, and reminded him that she had had her big greyhound, Bras, imprisoned all the afternoon, and that she had to go down to Borvabost with a message for some people who were leaving by the boat in the morning.

        “But you can not go away down to Borvabost by yourself, Sheila,” said Ingram. “It will be dark before you return.”

        “It will not be darker than this all the night through,” said the girl.

        5. “But I hope you will let us go with you,” said Lavender, rather anxiously; and she assented with a gracious smile, and went to fetch the great deerhound that was her constant companion. And lo! he found himself walking with a Princess in this wonderland, through the magic twilight that prevails in northern latitudes. Mackenzie and Ingram had gone to the front. The large deerhound, after regarding him attentively, had gone to its mistress’s side, and remained closely there.



              6. Even Sheila, when they had reached the loftiest part of their route, and could see beneath them the island and the water surrounding it, was struck by the exceeding beauty of the twilight; and as for her companion, he remembered it many a time thereafter, as if it were a dream of the sea.

        7. Before them lay the Atlantic—a pale line of blue, still, silent, and remote. Overhead the sky was of a clear, thin gold, with heavy masses of violet cloud stretched across from north to south, and thickening as they got near the horizon. Down at their feet, near the shore, a dusky line of huts and houses was scarcely visible; and over these lay a pale blue film of peat[33] smoke that did not move in the still air.

        8. Then they saw the bay into which the White Water runs, and they could trace the yellow glimmer of the river stretching into the island through a level valley of bog and morass. Far away towards the east lay the bulk of the island,—dark green undulations of moorland and pasture; and there, in the darkness, the gable of one white house had caught the clear light of the sky, and was gleaming westward like a star.

        9. But all this was as nothing to the glory that began to shine in the southeast, where the sky was of a pale violet over the peaks of Mealasabhal and Suainabhal. There, into the beautiful dome, rose the golden crescent of the moon, warm in color, as though it still retained the last rays of the sunset. A line of quivering gold fell across Loch Roag, and touched the black hull and spars of the boat in which Sheila had been sailing in the morning.

        10. That bay down there, with its white sands and massive rocks, its still expanse of water, and its background of mountain peaks palely covered by the yellow moonlight, seemed really a home for a magic princess who was shut off from all the world. But here, in front of them, was another sort of sea, and another sort of life,—a small fishing village hidden under a cloud of pale peat smoke, and fronting the great waters of the Atlantic itself, which lay under a gloom of violet clouds.

        11. On the way home it was again Lavender’s good fortune to walk with Sheila across the moorland path they had traversed some little time before. And now the moon was still higher in the heavens, and the yellow lane of light that crossed the violet waters of Loch Roag quivered in a deeper gold. The night air was scented with the Dutch clover growing down by the shore. They could hear the curlew[34] whistling and the plover[35] calling amid that monotonous plash of the waves that murmured all around the coast.

        12. When they returned to the house, the darker waters of the Atlantic and the purple clouds of the west were shut out from sight; and before them there was only the liquid plain of Loch Roag, with its pathway of yellow fire, and far away on the other side the shoulders and peaks of the southern mountains, that had grown gray and clear and sharp in the beautiful twilight. And this was Sheila’s home.

        威廉 · 布莱克 (1841～1898)，为英国现代领军小说家。他的故事大多以苏格兰为背景。威廉极为擅长描述苏格兰人物，然而，他诗性化风景的描绘能力，以及生动细致的艺术勾勒最为世人推崇，下列段落节选自他的名作《极北之地的公主》便是极好佐证。除该篇作品外，布莱克先生著名作品还有《赫的女儿》、《四轮敞篷马车的奇异冒险》、《基尔门尼》，以及《好斗的麦克劳德》。





        1.在海滩以及住处周边半小时的散步途中，莱维德紧随希拉左右，对她百般依顺。夏季的黄昏，周围静寂极了，天空明亮依然，当两人准备坐在餐桌前吃饭时，莱维德为希拉披上浪漫色调的外套。

        2.希拉父亲长有一副漂亮的灰色胡须，眉毛粗黑浓重。在这处可以俯瞰大海的孤零零房舍，他心里珍藏心上人的美好记忆，俨然一位威严的极地之王。夕阳西下，天空金光夺目四溢，希拉信步走向大西洋海边沙滩。极地公主那么漂亮迷人，那双美丽的眼睛扑闪着无数极地传奇，漂亮的脸庞里隐藏多少无以言说的深邃神秘！

        3.晚餐后，希拉和父亲走到屋外，在花园里长凳坐下。凉风送爽，夏季的傍晚心旷神怡。太阳裹着一团红色烈焰落入寥廓的大西洋，西边天陲现出深浅不一的火红斑斓，浅黄色头顶上空，玫瑰色的薄云空渺朦胧，纹丝不动。身边大海安然若素，粼粼银光的海面逶迤绵延到远处的洛赫罗格海湾。暮色里凉风袭人，暗香浮动。不远的岸边周遭静谧，甚至可以听见浪花拍打沙滩传来的窃窃私语。

        4.姑娘将手搭放在父亲额头，父亲想起女儿养的那条格雷伊猎犬布莱丝，那天布莱丝被关了整整一个下午，当时希拉要去波沃博斯特给人送信，那些人第二天一早就要乘船离开。“希拉，你不能独自去波沃博斯特，”英格拉姆说，“回来的路上，恐怕你没到家，天就会黑了。”“没事，不会比这里整晚通宵更黑。”希拉回答。

        5.“最好还是让我们和你一起去吧。”莱维德对希拉说，神情很是焦虑，姑娘豪爽地笑了笑表示赞同，接着，她转身去牵那条猎鹿犬，那狗与希拉总是形影不离。瞧！莱维德觉得自己在这块梦幻土地上与极地公主一起，在北纬充满神奇的极光中穿越莽莽冰原。那时，麦肯齐和英格拉姆已先行离开了，那条体积庞大的猎鹿犬警觉地打量莱维德一番，走过来紧紧依偎在女主人身旁。

        6.当希拉和莱维德到达路途中海拔最高处，两人鸟瞰整个岛屿和周边海面，希拉亦为美轮美奂的极光感到惊悚震撼，而莱维德眼中的北极光，宛如大海的无边梦幻，多年以后，他依然记起北极天空的寥廓壮观，久久难以忘怀。



              7.大西洋卧在眼前——那是遥远的寂静安宁中一抹灰蓝。头顶天空清澈无比，夹杂稀疏细薄的金黄，紫罗兰色的厚实云团从北往南横铺天穹，愈接近地平面，云团愈发厚重。在他们站立的脚下，那块毗邻岸边的地方，成排的房屋村舍隐约憧憧，一柱蓝色泥炭炊烟隐绰升起，在静谧的空中悄然凝固。

        8.他们然后看见那条大河急速奔腾流入海湾，目光追随黄色的微光溯河而上，那道星云流过等高的沼泽与山谷，最后流入那座小岛，岛屿大半向东延伸很远，很远；黑暗中，远处荒原牧野现出墨绿色的波浪起伏，天空清澈的极光射在一处白色房舍的山墙，墙体向西缓慢漂移，宛如飘曳浮动的半空星辰。

        9.不过，上述风景委实算不上精彩。此刻的东南方天空朦胧发光，美那沙巴和苏恩那巴高耸顶峰上，天空洇出一条浅淡紫色，一轮金色新月从那里升起，然后跃入苍莽天穹，艳黄月牙，似乎挽住夕阳最后一缕辉煌；一道金光泻落，颤抖地粼粼扫过洛赫罗格海湾，扫过黑黢黢的船身还有桅杆，那条当天清早希拉扬帆出海的小船。

        10.脚下那片海湾沙滩洁白，岸边巨石嶙峋，水面更见宽阔无边，海湾上空，金黄色月光将山峰背景映成苍白，好一处与世隔绝中极地公主的神奇家园。眼前大海自有别样迷人风情，别样不同生活，藏匿在隐绰泥炭炊烟下的小渔村里，独自面对浩瀚大西洋的惊涛骇浪，在紫色晦暗云团下慵懒演绎一轮轮庸常岁月。

        11.对莱维德来说，回家路上的他，真是再度幸运光临，能与希拉携手走出先前颇费艰难才跋涉穿过的一处沼泽地。此时月亮在空中升得更高，一条黄色的光柱通衢横跨洛赫罗格紫色的海面，在愈加深黄的夜幕深处战栗摇曳。夜风习习，弥漫出岸边荷兰三叶草的清馨芬芳；沙滩四周，海浪单调如一的拍打声碎细呢喃，莱维德和希拉甚至还能听到麻鹬的鸣啾，偶然夹杂凤头麦鸡的求偶声。

        12.希拉和莱维德回到家，西部边陲大西洋更为黝黑的海面从他们眼中消失，同时消逝的还有天空众多的紫色云团，偌大平静的洛赫罗格海湾铺在面前；海水上空，一条亮丽的焰火之路延伸向远。越过南方绵亘山脉的山脊或巅峰。那片遥远地方呵，美丽极光不断演绎着大自然神奇，时而晦暗幽深，时而热烈清朗，时而惊诧莫名，那，就是希拉可爱的家园。

THE GREAT VOICES


        伟大的声音

        Charles T. Brooks (b. 1813, d. 1833) was born at Salem, Mass., and was the valedictorian of his class at Harvard College, where he graduated in 1832. He shortly afterwards entered the ministry, and had charge of a congregation at Newport, R.I. He was a great student of German literature, and began his own literary career by a translations of Schiller’s “William Tell.” This was followed by numerous translations from the German, mainly poetry, which have been published from time to time, in several volumes. Of these translations, Goethe’s “Faust,” Richter’s “Titan” and “Hesperus,” and a humorous poem by Dr. Karl Arnold Kortum, “The Life, Opinions, Actions, and Fate of Hieronimus Jobs, the Candidate,” deserve especial mention. Mr. Brooks also published a number of original poems, addresses, etc.





        1. A voice from the sea to the mountains,

        From the mountains again to the sea;

        A call from the deep to the fountains,—

        “O spirit! be glad and be free.”

        2. A cry from the floods to the fountains;

        And the torrents repeat the glad song

        As they leap from the breast of the mountains,—

        “O spirit! be free and be strong.”





        3. The pine forests thrill with emotion

        Of praise, as the spirit sweeps by:

        With a voice like the murmur of ocean

        To the soul of the listener they cry.

        4. Oh! sing, human heart, like the fountains,

        With joy reverential and free,

        Contented and calm as the mountains,

        And deep as the woods and the sea.

        1．一个声音，从海洋滚过山脉，

        接着，又从山脉荡回海洋，

        LESSON 113





A PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE


        人生如画

         Samuel Johnson (b. 1709, d. 1784). This remarkable man was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, England. He was the son of a bookseller and stationer. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but his poverty compelled him to leave at the end of three years. Soon after his marriage, in 1736, he opened a private school, but obtained only three pupils, one of whom was David Garrick, afterwards a celebrated actor. In 1737, he removed to London, where he resided most of the rest of his life. The most noted of his numerous literary works are his “Dictionary,” the first one of the English language worthy of mention, “The Vanity of Human Wishes,” a poem, “The Rambler,” “Rasselas,” “The Lives of the English Poets,” and his edition of Shakespeare. An annual pension of 300 pounds was granted him in 1762. In person, Johnson was heavy and awkward; in manner, boorish and overbearing; but his learning and his great powers caused his company to be sought by many eminent men.

        1. Obidah, the son of Abnesina, left the caravansary[1] early in the morning, and pursued his journey through the plains of Hindostan. He was fresh and vigorous with rest; he was animated with hope; he was incited by desire; he walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw the hills gradually rising before him.

        2. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the morning song of the bird of paradise; he was fanned by the last flutters of the sinking breeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices; he sometimes contemplated towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter of the spring; all his senses were gratified, and all care was banished from his heart.

        3. Thus he went on, till the sun approached his meridian, and the increasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked round about him for some more commodious path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that seemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant. He did not, however, forget whither he was traveling, but found a narrow way, bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the same direction with the main road, and was pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite pleasure with business, and to gain the rewards of diligence without suffering its fatigues.

        4. He, therefore, still continued to walk for a time, without the least remission of his ardor, except that he was sometimes tempted to stop by the music of the birds, which the heat had assembled in the shade, and sometimes amused himself with picking the flowers that covered the banks on each side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At last, the green path began to decline from its first tendency, and to wind among the hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls.

        5. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether it was longer safe to forsake the known and common track; but, remembering that the heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty and uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed only to make a few meanders[2], in compliance with the garieties of the ground, and to end at last in the common road.



              6. Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace, though he suspected he was not gaining ground. This uneasiness of his mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every sensation that might soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo, he mounted every hill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside to every cascade, and pleased himself with tracing the course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region, with innumerable circumvolutions[3].

        7. In these amusements, the hours passed away uncounted; his deviations[4] had perplexed his memory, and he knew not toward what point to travel. He stood pensive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of loitering was now past. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was overspread with clouds, the day vanished from before him, and a sudden tempest gathered round his head.

        8. He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the grove, and despised the petty curiosity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.

        9. He now resolved to do what remained yet in his power; to tread back the ground which he had passed, and try to find some issue where the wood might open into the plain. He prostrated himself upon the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of nature. He rose with confidence and tranquillity, and pressed on with his saber in his hand; for the beasts of the desert were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage, and fear, and ravage, and expiration[5]; all the horrors of darkness and solitude surrounded him; the winds roared in the woods, and the torrents tumbled from the hills.

        10. Thus, forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the wild without knowing whither he was going or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to safety or to destruction. At length, not fear but labor began to overcome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled, and he was on the point of lying down, in resignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced toward the light, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before him such provisions as he had collected for himself, on which Obidah fed with eagerness and gratitude.

        11. When the repast was over, “Tell me,” said the hermit, “by what chance thou hast been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of this wilderness, in which I never saw a man before.” Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or palliation[6].

        12. “Son,” said the hermit, “let the errors and follies, the dangers and escapes, of this day, sink deep into your heart. Remember, my son, that human life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of youth, full of vigor, and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope, with gayety and with diligence, and travel on awhile in the straight road of piety toward the mansions of rest. In a short time we remit our fervor, and endeavor to find some mitigation[7] of our duty, and some more easy means of obtaining the same end.



              13. “We then relax our vigor, and resolve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constancy, and venture to approach what we resolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ease, and repose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and vigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire whether another advance can not be made, and whether we may not at least turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleasure. We approach them with scruple and hesitation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pass through them without losing the road of virtue, which we for a while keep in our sight, and to which we propose to return.

        14. “But temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we, in time, lose the happiness of innocence, and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifications. By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate[8] object of rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge ourselves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths[9] of inconstancy till the darkness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, and with repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we had not forsaken the paths of virtue.

        15. “Happy are they, my son, who shall learn, from thy example, not to despair, but shall remember that though the day is past, and their strength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that reformation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavors ever unassisted; that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he who implores strength and courage from above, shall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose: commit thyself to the care of Omnipotence; and when the morning calls again to toil, begin anew thy journey and thy life.”

        1．艾比内斯纳的儿子奥巴代亚清早离开了商队旅馆，继续他横贯印度斯坦大平原的漫长旅程。一宿安睡后，他显得神清气爽，满怀征服欲望，他全身充满活力地穿山越谷，一片山峦渐渐地耸立眼前。

        2．奥巴代亚一路向前走，清晨，耳边传来偌大一片鸟儿天堂的快乐鸣啾。微风和煦阵阵拂面，灌木丛林露水芬芳，周围景色令他心旷神怡。他时而望着树冠蔽日的高大橡树，厚重沧桑彰显森林君王的大家风范；时而瞥见风光旖旎里蓬勃怒放的迎春花，春风中率先绽放第一缕芳香娇艳；他的脚步愈发轻松矫健，所有烦恼一股脑儿烟飞云散。

        3．他不停地走着，太阳慢慢升到头顶，酷日灼热不断地消耗他的力气。他四处打量一番，看能否找到些许凉荫躲避，就在那时，他突然看见右手前方一处树丛似乎向他招手呼唤，正中下怀的他随即走进那片浓密的翠绿凉荫，当然，他并未忘记前方行程，眼前一条缀满鲜花的狭窄小路，方向途径大致不差，显得那么顺理成章。欣喜的是，这种快乐让他感到，枯燥的长途跋涉中，伴随轻松愉悦的音符响起，既能在辛勤劳动有所收获，又无需经历痛苦磨难。

        4．他兴致盎然地迈步前行，有时停下脚步，聆听鸟儿声声鸣啾，丛林中扑来沁透心脾的凉爽，似乎收尽了漫天暑气；有时颇为自得地采撷路边野花，或捋下路边枝干上荡悠的三两野果。末了，满眼绿色的小路从此处径直往下延伸，周围山泉叮咚相间，瀑布浪花飞溅越起，空中泛起阵阵清新凉意，眼前小路一路蜿蜒，仄入连绵无尽的山岭密林。

        5．走到一处地方，奥巴代亚停住了脚步，他思忖着，离开那条老路是否会发生什么意外，转而一想，此刻阳光炙热灼人，老路上灰尘满天，坑洼不平，他当即决定还是循着新路往前走。他觉得，只消顺着这条路拐上几个弯，最终总会拐回老路上。

        6．想到这里，他不再焦虑，继续前行，尽管心中隐隐有些狐疑，或许真会迷路吗？随着心中愈来愈多的忐忑不安，他开始仔细打量周边的景色，不放过视线里不断出现的陌生物体，甚至不时暗自宽慰自己。

        他细心聆听树林里的微小回声，他攀爬途经的每处高地，查看延伸向远的风景，揣测推断地形地貌的特征端倪，不幸的是，他所走过的关键路口，毫无例外地偏离了原先的正常路径。直到最后，他才欣喜地发现，一条河流从森林中静静流过，河面流域极为宽广，九曲十八弯中有数不清的回转盘旋。



              7．七兜八转的东奔西突，时间过得飞快，难以确定的方向干扰了他的记忆，后来，他简直不知道究竟朝哪里走才好。他木木地站立那里，陷入迷惘，脑子里一片混乱，他不敢迈步向前，唯恐再走错了路，尽管这样，他毕竟觉察到，时间在他的反复折腾中飞快流逝。正当他百般纠结时，刹那间，天空乌云密布，刚才明晃晃的天空旋即变得晦暗混沌，突如其来的暴雨云团在他头顶上空急遽聚集。

        8．突然间清楚眼前的困厄险境，他为起初的愚蠢后悔万分，此刻他才意识到，拐入岔路前尚有路人可以询问，而他却是糟蹋了良好机遇！想起当时不假思索，一门心思要在丛林里寻觅荫凉，加上微不足道的好奇心，却让此时的他手足无措，难以脱身，想到这里，他不禁长吁短叹起来。正当他兀自后悔不迭时，天刹时愈来愈黑，一道霹雳电闪，打断了他的思路。

        9．他决心利用仅存体力沿原路返回，首先必须先找到森林通向平原的出口。他随后匍匐在地，让身心感应自然之神，片刻功夫，他充满自信地站立起来，内心格外宁静。由于唯恐森林里野兽四处出没，他拔出军刀以作防身。此刻，四面八方的野兽嚎叫接连涌来，愤怒、恐惧、践踏乃至死亡的气息紧紧地攫住了他，他身处黑暗，孤孑一人，惶恐不安在他周边不断萦绕增大，风声尖利地在森林里呼啸而过，激流翻滚端急从山顶訇然而下。

        10．他如此孤独地在森林里跌跌撞撞，伴随撕心裂肺的担忧和痛苦，他不清楚自己究竟走往何方，亦不知晓每时每刻离安全抑或死亡距离更近。最后，他心中不再恐惧，只有双脚铅一般沉重，他的呼吸变得特别急促，膝盖甚而亦无法站直，人似乎接近瘫倒。万般无奈之时，透过一处荆棘，他突然看见一丝锥形光亮；他朝着那丝光亮走去，发现一个身影从隐蔽的茅屋里闪出，他怯意地叫唤起来，得到许可，他才走进屋里。一位老人慷慨地拿出食物，摆在他的面前，奥巴代亚忙不迭地吃了起来，满心感激难以表述。

        11．吃过饭后，那位森林隐士问他，“告诉我，你怎么来到这里？在这块渺无人烟的荒野森林里，我已经生活了二十年了，这么多年来，我在这片林子里从未遇见任何人。”奥巴代亚告诉老人自己路途中的经历，以及迷路的来龙去脉，他未加丝毫隐瞒地坦诚相告。

        12．“我的孩子，”那位老人说，“不妨让今天这些错误与愚蠢，危险与临阵逃脱深深藏于你的心底。请你记住，我的孩子，人的生活就像一天的旅程。我们在青春的早晨起床，到处生机勃勃充满期待；我们怀揣希望，春风得意且勤勉发奋，精神饱满地踏上旅途；我们心怀无比虔诚，走向那条径直通往心灵之乡的大路，没想到刚走不远，转眼间，我们的炽烈热情开始退却，开始努力寻找可以减轻我们职责的东西，寻求更为简单可抵达终结的途径。



              13．“然后，我们斗志开始松懈，告诫自己不再对远方的罪孽感到恐惧，我们仅仅依赖个体的坚持，甚至冒险走近危险地带，那块我们曾经发誓永远不会涉及的地方；就这样，我们走进安逸凉亭，在自以为安全的荫凉地带休憩，我们的心在闲逸松弛中得以柔软，警觉随之减退，于是，我们便开始询问是否存在另一种进展可能？我们是否至少不能仅仅沉湎于花前月下的享受？我们踌躇犹豫地走近，怀着颇为羞怯颤抖的内心；我们总是希望自己能够闯关成功，而又不会迷失美德，这条美德道路，我们曾一度举目可及，后来却盘算原路返回。

        14．“毕竟，诱惑成功诱惑了诱惑，屈从后面仍是屈从，最终，我们完全失去清纯无辜的快乐，以感官刺激抚慰自己焦虑的身心。渐渐地，我们抛却自己最初目标的承诺，放弃唯一充足信念的理性欲求。我们在金钱中百般纠结，沉湎于奢侈享受，徘徊在反复无常的迷宫，直到风烛残年，黑暗开始吞噬我们；直到忧心忡忡，我们疾病缠身，步履蹒跚。在恐惧悲哀、悔恨夹杂希望欲求的百感交集中，我们回想自己一生，那些太过频繁、徒劳枉然的欲望，迫使我们不得不一次次背离美德的康庄正途。

        15．“我的孩子，那些将从你的教训中获得启示的人，将会多么幸福。他们不会绝望，且铭记在心。虽然今天已经过去，辛苦已经付出，然而依然有待继续前行。改变绝非等同失望，真诚拼搏并不意味孤独无助；漂泊者最终将反思自己所有的谬误，祈求从过去失误中获得力量与勇气，那么，他会发现危险或苦难会在他的面前退却。现在动身吧，我的孩子，奔赴你精神的长眠之乡，将自己交与上帝眷顾，当晨钟再次呼唤接受苦难，不妨开始你全新生活的崭新旅程吧！”

A SUMMER LONGING


        夏天的渴望

        George Arnold (b. 1834, d. 1865) was born in New York, but removed with his parents to Illinois while yet an infant. There he passed his boyhood, being educated at home by his parents. In 1849 the family again removed to Strawberry Farms, Monmouth County, N.J. When eighteen years old he began to study painting, but soon gave up the art and devoted himself to literature. He became a journalist of New York City, and his productions include almost every variety of writings found in the literary magazines. After his death, two volumes of his poems, “Drift: a Seashore Idyl,” and “Poems, Grave and Gay,” were edited by Mr. William Winter.





        1. I must away to the wooded hills and vales,

        Where broad, slow streams flow cool and silently

        And idle barges flap their listless sails.

        For me the summer sunset glows and pales,

        And green fields wait for me.





        2. I long for shadowy founts, where the birds

        Twitter and chirp at noon from every tree;

        I long for blossomed leaves and lowing herds;

        And Nature’s voices say in mystic words,

        “The green fields wait for thee.”





        3. I dream of uplands, where the primrose shines

        And waves her yellow lamps above the lea;

        Of tangled copses, swung with trailing vines;

        Of open vistas, skirted with tall pines,

        Where green fields wait for me.





        4. I think of long, sweet afternoons, when I

        May lie and listen to the distant sea,

        Or hear the breezes in the reeds that sigh,

        Or insect voices chirping shrill and dry,

        In fields that wait for me.





        5. These dreams of summer come to bid me find

        The forest’s shade, the wild bird’s melody,

        While summer’s rosy wreaths for me are twined,

        While summer’s fragrance lingers on the wind,

        And green fields wait for me.

        1．我要离开， 去幽深的沟壑溪谷，

        河水宽阔， 静穆流淌着沁凉，

        停泊的船， 风儿扑打倦怠长帆，

        夕阳的光， 炙热刺目，

        绿色田野， 等待着我。





        2．我向往那，蓊郁树林边清泉，

        鸟声鼎沸，躲避正午的炎炎，

        繁花落尽，果树下哞哞牛群，

        静谧柔和，自然纯净的天籁，

        绿色田野，等待着我。





        3．我梦想， 樱草花盛开的高处，

        草地上， 黄色灯笼随风滚翻，

        灌木丛， 藤茎蔓延摇曳多姿，

        松林高耸，点缀满目寥廓苍翠，

        绿色田野，等待着我。





        4．我期待， 漫长舒适的夏季午后，

        躺卧在地，聆听远处海浪呼吸，

        微风拂过，传来芦苇深深叹息，

        虫鸣四起，声声锐利饥渴难耐，

        绿色田野，等待着我。





        5．夏季梦幻，热烈期待纷沓至来，

        丛林荫蔽，孕育鸟儿婉转歌喉，

        玫瑰花环，编织夏天繁复美丽，

        芳香浓郁，风中徘徊难以忘记，

        绿色田野，等待着我。

FATE


        命 运

        Francis Bret Harte (b. 1839, d.1902) was born in Albany, N.Y. When seventeen years old he went to California, where he engaged in various employments. He was a teacher, was employed in government offices, worked in the gold mines, and learned to be a compositor in a printing office. In 1868 he started the “Overland Monthly,” and his original and characteristic poems and sketches soon made it a popular magazine. Mr. Harte has been a contributor to some of the leading periodicals of the country, but principally to the “Atlantic Monthly.”





        1. “The sky is clouded, the rocks are bare;

        The spray of the tempest is white in air;

        The winds are out with the waves at play,

        And I shall not tempt the sea to-day.





        2. “The trail is narrow, the wood is dim,

        The panther clings to the arching limb;

        And the lion’s whelps are abroad at play,

        And I shall not join in the chase to-day.”





        3. But the ship sailed safely over the sea,

        And the hunters came from the chase in glee;

        And the town that was builded upon a rock

        Was swallowed up in the earthquake shock.

THE BIBLE THE BEST OF CLASSICS


        《圣经》——最好的经典

        Thomas S. Grimke (b. 1786, d. 1834). This eminent lawyer and scholar was born in Charleston, S.C. He graduated at Yale College in 1807. He gained considerable reputation as a politician, but is best known as an advocate of peace, Sunday schools, and the Bible. He was a man of deep feeling, earnest purpose, and pure life.





        1. There is a classic[1] the best the world has ever seen, the noblest that has ever honored and dignified the language of mortals. If we look into its antiquity, we discover a title to our veneration unrivaled in the history of literature. If we have respect to its evidences, they are found in the testimony of miracle and prophecy; in the ministry of man, of nature, and of angels, yea, even of “God, manifest in the flesh,” of “God blessed forever.”

        2. If we consider its authenticity[2], no other pages have survived the lapse of time that can be compared with it. If we examine its authority, for it speaks as never man spake, we discover that it came from heaven in vision and prophecy under the sanction[3] of Him who is Creator of all things, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift.

        3. If we reflect on its truths, they are lovely and spotless, sublime and holy as God himself, unchangeable as his nature, durable as his righteous dominion, and versatile[4] as the moral condition of mankind. If we regard the value of its treasures, we must estimate them, not like the relics of classic antiquity, by the perishable glory and beauty, virtue and happiness, of this world, but by the enduring perfection and supreme felicity of an eternal kingdom.

        4. If we inquire who are the men that have recorded its truths, vindicated[5] its rights, and illustrated the excellence of its scheme, from the depth of ages and from the living world, from the populous continent and the isles of the sea, comes forth the answer: “The patriarch and the prophet, the evangelist[6] and the martyr.”

        5. If we look abroad through the world of men, the victims of folly or vice, the prey of cruelty, of injustice, and inquire what are its benefits, even in this temporal state, the great and the humble, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the learned and the ignorant reply, as with one voice, that humility and resignation, purity, order, and peace, faith, hope, and charity are its blessings upon earth.

        6. And if, raising our eyes from time to eternity; from the world of mortals to the world of just men made perfect; from the visible creation, marvelous, beautiful, and glorious as it is, to the invisible creation of angels and seraphs[7]; from the footstool of God to the throne of God himself, we ask, what are the blessings that flow from this single volume, let the question be answered by the pen of the evangelist, the harp of the prophet, and the records of the book of life.



              7. Such is the best of classics the world has ever admired; such, the noblest that man has ever adopted as a guide.

        托马斯 · 艾斯 · 格里姆克(1786～1834)，为著名律师兼学者，出生于美国南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿。1807年，格里姆克先生毕业于耶鲁大学，作为声名显赫的政治家，他更为积极地倡导和平运动、周日学校以及弘扬《圣经》，在美国民众中极富声望。格里姆克先生情感深厚，意愿真切，生活纯粹美好。





        1.这是世界文明迄今为止的古典精粹，这是有史以来人类语言的庄严高贵。如果走入沧桑阅尽的尘封过往，我们将在文学史上发现那种无愧人类无与伦比的崇敬描述。倘若，我们见证其存在而心生景仰，它们在神迹与预言中得以验证：造福人类，关爱自然，敬畏天神，的确，“神，以肉身显现，”“上帝，赐福永远。”



        2.如果我们怀疑《圣经》的真实性，那么，任何留存于漫长时光流逝里文献典籍无法与其媲美；倘若我们质疑《圣经》的权威性，因为它从未发出类似人类声音，我们最终发现《圣经》原本来自上天的视角，来自创造万物造物主掌控中预言，来自世间所有仁爱善行与无私馈赠的授予。

        3.如果我们探求《圣经》真相，它如此崇高神圣，甚至委实无可挑剔，因为它与上帝本身无异，与圣父本质同样不可改变，与上天公正掌控同样连绵经久，与人类道德标准同样万能通用。倘若我们关注《圣经》的珍贵价值，我们必须对它做出评价，就价值而言，历代珍宝遗迹荣耀精美但易于衰败，美德快乐稍纵即逝；而《圣经》凭借永恒王国日久弥新的完美，以及至高无上的幸福永存于世。

        4.如果我们探询究竟何人记载下《圣经》真迹，印证《圣经》的权利，阐明《圣经》的卓越建构，从岁月幽深的尘封，到凡世红尘的喧嚣，从芸芸众生的洲陆，到天涯的寥落之角，所及之处的回音异口同声：“上帝是世界创始人与预言者，人类福音的传道者及殉道人。”

        5.如果我们纵览整个人类世界，目睹那些愚蠢或恶习的受害者，残虐暴行或非正义的牺牲者，我们将会质问，究竟有谁才是世间罪孽的受益者？甚至在当下世俗层面，伟大抑或卑微，富人抑或穷人，权高望重抑或渺小卑微，饱学之士抑或无知之徒，亦会发出同一声音，即谦卑、顺从、纯粹、守序、平和、信仰、希望以及善行皆为上帝带给世界的美好福音。



              6.因此，如果我们仰望上天，想象时间进入永恒，想象滚滚红尘进入人类梦寐以求的世界大同，想象那些恰如上帝本体、触目可及的创造与神奇、美丽与荣光，乃至众多天使亦无法察觉的恢弘创造；从上帝脚趾直抵上帝皇冠，我们一直在探求，从这人类唯一卷轶浩繁的《圣经》中流泻的福祉究竟是什么？不妨追溯传道士手中的蘸笔，先知吟唱的竖琴，以及生命大书的誊撰记录，答案自会知晓。



        7.这是世界文明迄今为止高山仰止的古典精粹，这是有史以来人类升华自身的庄严高贵。

MY MOTHER’S BIBLE


        妈妈的《圣经》

        George P. Morris (b. 1802, d. 1864) was born in Philadelphia. In 1823 he became one of the editors of the “New York Mirror,” a weekly literary paper, In 1846 Mr. Morris and N. P. Willis founded “The Home Journal.” He was associate editor of this popular journal until a short time before his death.





        1. This book is all that’s left me now,—

        Tears will unbidden start,—

        With faltering lip and throbbing brow

         I press it to my heart.

        For many generations past

        Here is our family tree;

        My mother’s hands this Bible clasped,

        She, dying, gave it me.

        2. Ah! well do I remember those

        Whose names these records bear;

        Who round the hearthstone used to close,

        After the evening prayer,

        And speak of what these pages said

        In tones my heart would thrill!

        Though they are with the silent dead,

        Here are they living still!





        3. My father read this holy hook

        To brothers, sisters, dear;

        How calm was my poor mother’s look,

        Who loved God’s word to hear!

        Her angel face,—I see it yet!

        What thronging memories come!

        Again that little group is met

        Within the walls of home!





        4. Thou truest friend man ever knew,

        Thy constancy I’ve tried;

        When all were false, I found thee true,

        My counselor and guide.

        The mines of earth no treasures give



              That could this volume buy;

        In teaching me the way to live,

        It taught me how to die.

        1．这本《圣经》，妈妈留下的唯一纪念。

        每当看见，禁不住泪水扑簌，

        双唇嗫嚅，痛苦的心在悸动，

        珍惜万分，我将它捧在心窝。

        追溯沧桑岁月，不堪回首，

        庞大家庭树，清晰的家族脉络，

        相片上， 妈妈将《圣经》紧握，

        她永远离开了，将书留给我。





        2．啊！我清晰记得，

        《圣经》上，那多鲜活过去，

        壁炉边，家庭聚集的气息，

        晚间祷告后，每天热烈话题，

        报纸上，时事奇闻轶事，

        历历如目，触手可及的震撼。

        尽管，亲人们早已谢世，

        宛如昨天，热闹非凡的场景。





        3．爸爸大声朗读，这本《圣经》，

        兄弟姐妹，依偎他的身旁，

        窘困中的妈妈，神采飞扬，

        急切期盼，聆听上帝声音，

        流水的日子，蜂拥而至，



              万家灯火，难以磨灭的记忆，

        生死重逢，我们再度相遇。



        4．《圣经》，我最信任的朋友，

        那恒久的忠贞不渝。

        即便世界，充满谎言欺诈，

        唯一真诚的你，引我前行。

        即便世界，所有金矿，

        亦无法，替代你的珍贵。

        上帝，它教我如何处世豁达，

        《圣经》，它教我怎样直面生死。
