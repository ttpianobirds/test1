so why aren't there flying cars you just

jumping right in you don't say hi

you don't say how's the wife already

how's the wife

how's your book it's been on The Times

bestseller list for how many weeks oh

that the astrophysics for people in a

hurry that's been on the on the New York

Times bestseller was for 67 weeks that's

pretty intense

it's great that's that's a lot for any

book much less for a science book and so

that tells me while all these Trump

books are wafting in and out this is Bob

being like a court like a cork on the

ocean waves as the book of the moment

that either praises Trump or criticized

or it criticizes them come in and off of

that list so this tells me that there is

this unserved hunger that people have

there's a curiosity that this is serving

and it's - astrophysics for people in a

hurry that's kind of a that's very

purposefully juxtaposed it's like

neurosurgery in four easy steps you know

if you saw a book with that title you

have to pick up under what's going on

well not to kiss your ass again but I

always say this about you and I think

it's important you make learning stuff

about astrophysics fun and that's what's

missing you know it's not that people

don't like to be educated that they

don't like to learn they just don't want

to be bored

that's a perceptive point because you

know think of the image we have of let's

say you're in a school where most people

don't go to college if you're in high

school and then last day of school comes

what do people do they toss their papers

in the air as they run down the steps

school's out no but what's the rock song

[Music]

forever right so that attitude must mean

the school didn't train you to embrace

curiosity right that learning was a

chore and now the chores are over yeah

so I think the educational system needs

an adjustment forget whether or not you

go to college because you're going to

spend

years not in school than in school even

if you do go to college what you want I

think are lifelong learners lifelong

curiosity yes where once you are trained

and and and and and your curiosity is

stimulated the curiosity we've all had

as children your children don't need to

be taught to be curious they are curious

to the point of destruction of whatever

it is they touch oh what is this egg on

the counter

what is this glass what is this plate

what's under a rock what happens when I

pull a leg off a daddy long you know

they are experimenting with the world we

don't think of it that way but that's

what it is they're all born scientists

and I say this often you spend the first

years of a child's life teaching it to

walk and talk then you spend the rest of

its life telling it to shut up and sit

it's this this is the wrong combination

so speaking as an educator I think a

missing component of school is is that

the teachers is that the curriculum I

don't know but when you get out of

school you should say to yourself damn I

want to learn more it's almost

universally accepted to that that's when

you're learning ends when you get out of

college it's over you say you're done

and if it doesn't you're ossified in

line and that's how when the job market

shifts you're not ready for it because

you don't know how to think you don't

know how to learn right no and it's the

difference in the in the workplace

between the person who gets an

assignment I Joey

Janet I need you to do this that's not

in my job description I'm not trained

for this that's one kind of person in a

workplace another kind of person is but

here's a new task I need you to do wow

I've never seen that before

great let me figure it out right he's a

two completely different species of

human being and what the world needs

more of is like the the second case

where you take a new task and you say

wow I get to learn I'm gonna learn on my

own I'll ask people who know more you

just you just embrace the act of

learning to satisfy your curiosity and I

think this book is capturing that in the

public I must be doing something yeah

yeah 60 how many weeks 67 weeks yeah

yeah that's a lot of weeks yeah every

morning I wake up I'm I'm calm but I'm

really not calm I'm saying holy [ __ ]

sorry you're alive I can't can I say you

can say [ __ ] I could say it Isis we're

human people think you're a robot now

they know this is it's a great sign I

think and I think your podcast is a

great sign as well the success of your

podcast and the success of a lot of

science podcasts that's an excellent you

notice that there's a rise of science

curious podcast out there stuff to blow

your mind is one that I really enjoy

right I really love radio lab they've

always got elaborate interesting science

the annual perennial favorite that so

many people probably the best right yeah

and and yours as well and I love Chuck

nice shout-out to Chuck nice Oh Chuck we

love Chuck he's great but what you're

doing is you're making learning

interesting and that's why it's so fun

it's it's it's it's there's excitement

to it he bring a comedian like Chuck on

with you things get silly but they're

also curious and you're getting these

experts and everyone's talking about

these various subjects and and as you

know not only yourself as an exemplar of

this stand-up comedians are some of the

smartest people in the world they have

it that they have that far so stand-up

comedians are perceptive people yes and

for sure and they're aware and they

notice things that you don't notice they

see the same things you do and get to

shape it in a way you never thought

possible and then you end up laughing at

other things at yourself was it your

idea to do your show with stand-ups so

so what we have there there there was

several of us who have created this

concept and we there's Helen matzos is

one of the partners and there's another

one who's now left but I get his name in

a minute but there were three of us who

David gamble was his name the three of

us got together and applied for a

National Science Foundation grant what

we said was there are programs out there

that serve people who already know they

like science but who serves the people

who don't know they like science or

better yet the people who know they

don't like science

there's nothing for them because they've

already rejected it

they're not gonna tune in to science

Friday because they don't like science

right on NPR right so what we thought

was suppose we bring in a celebrity

we've all that the pop culture draw this

is the pop culture scaffold we bring in

this scaffold and glad the scaffold with

science because whatever the celebrity

does it doesn't matter there's gonna be

science in that person's life

we had the guy who portrayed Gollum in

Lord of the Rings a lot of getting that

suit that he underwear exactly so what

we did was we so we interview him and we

talked about the technology necessary to

portray go him as a lot he portrayed

that live that was not some later

animation he is live and he's got his

whole body wired up for this and he is

that voice and he is portraying it so so

whatever it is that you have done that

you do there is such because it's

evidence that science is everywhere

you're not gonna you can't say I'm done

with science let me sell my textbook and

move on to other things because

practically anything else you do has

been touched by science and so star talk

is a celebration of that and then a jump

species and so now we're on TV now

alright this is a TV show on National

Geographic Channel star talk

and since you started this by the way I

didn't come here to talk about you you

started this where's our fourth year in

a row we're nominated for an Emmy for

Outstanding informational programming

are you gonna keep doing cosmos too

though cuz Oh cosmos so so so I have one

week remaining out of like seven D shoot

days to finish shooting cosmos possible

worlds premiering spring 2019 there's

the third installment of cosmos if you

trace the first one to Carl Sagan back

in 1980 okay you are I used your segment

on wolves on how wolves became dogs Oh

showed it to my kids and that's right

see the little wheel spinning like whoa

yeah that's how dog became a dog that

what you didn't see is I'm sitting at

the campfire

and this in the snowy environment and

they got wolves walking around me there

on these fishing wires because they they

are not dogs right okay they they debate

over the [ __ ] they want

what correct and when they looking at

you it's it's like should I rip his neck

out now or later when I'm more hungry

right they're not there's no eye contact

with them because they you don't that

they don't see you as anything other

than something that could possibly eat

and so you can interact with them the

way you would with ordinary dogs so

they're on these fishing you know high

tension fishing wire that you can't see

against the snow and they're like

hooting and hollering around me as I

described and the name of that show is

and the wolf shall become the shepherd

yeah my friend did a commercial with the

wolf and there's this commercial where

he's running up this mountain and the

wolf is there and at the end of the

commercial they had to get the wolf to

snarl so what the trainer does is he

shows the wolf some meat and then he

pulls the meat away from the wolf and

the wolf snarls and they're like and

then the commercials over he's like no

no there's no working after that like

there's no Yukie not gonna be near the

wolf right like that switch is turned on

done yeah and it's it's crazy like once

that thing snarled everybody just backed

off and the trainer let everybody know

like once I get to this point we're done

like there's no more everybody can [ __ ]

out of here all three of these cosmoses

the original one with Carl Sagan the one

that the privilege of hosting in 2014

and 2019 are co-written by andrian and

she's the the widow of Carl Sagan oh my

and but she it kind of in his shadow

back then but she's hugely creative and

highly enlightened and so most of the

sort of the the the soul energy if you

will the that what makes cosmos distinct

from other from other documentaries

where you're sort of sitting there

learning you put your thinking cap on

your learning cap on in cosmos it's your

feelin cap you're not only learning

you're also feeling the science and its

relationship to you to civilization

to the world to the universe and her

infusion of this she's a highly

scientifically literate writer producer

and so I just give a shout out to her

just working with her as minute delight

his cosmos on Apple TV or so cosmos was

after at first after it premiered on Fox

and then went internationally on Nat Geo

it then went to Netflix so but I think

this run of Netflix is gonna drop until

the next one comes in I think they want

to clear the clear the landing zone for

the next cosmos but it went to Netflix

but is it available for anyone to get

right now oh right now it should be I

haven't checked that's a great question

I have it all on my DVR and I'm scared

to delete it oh I have like 6% left

space but everyone's DVR looks like I

got your cosmos is in there yeah so

thanks thanks for having having them all

in there who's that Morgan Freeman show

but through the through the wormhole

yeah yeah that's that's that's a Joe

Rogan thing yeah you didn't have that

I'd be disappointed huh I say you're an

imposter you're a fake it's it's an

opportunity to be entertained and

learned which i think is what everybody

misses and I think that's that's what's

missing in most public education it's

people are bored and you take these kids

with so much energy and then you make

them sit still and watch something

that's not even remotely stimulating by

a person who doesn't really care to be

there right right and they know they

know this they know this intuitively if

not explicitly that the enthusiasm is

absent yeah they could feel it yeah and

just it's the worst way to learn it's

the the worst way and it's so hard to

skate once you get out of that system it

takes forever for a lot of these people

to just get their excitement about

education back you know what I say when

I address teachers we all by the way

I'll do this right now in this room that

we have this only three of us but let's

let's take a show of hands in your life

with all the teachers you've ever had in

every class you've ever taken how many

had like a singular influence on who and

what you became

give me a number it's gonna be I'm

betting it's five or fewer probably more

like three yeah for teachers what's your

number

well theirs was the one that I talked

about in your show the last time I saw

you thanks for coming on to start my

pleasure it was a science teacher that I

had when I believe I was in seventh

grade

told me that if you really want to hurt

your brain look up and recognize the

fact that that goes on forever that this

is infinite and then just think about

what that means infinite that there

really is no end to it so but how many

teachers such as that we're so

influential on you that one guy saying

that one so he was not one class one he

might be the one and what do you got for

me it's like two and a half and I've had

scores of teachers yeah okay a hundred

teachers at least so what I tell

teachers is be that teacher to your

students we've all had those teachers be

that teacher and in every case it wasn't

because the topic was something you knew

in advance you would like it's because

their energy for sharing their passion

and love for the subject was palpable

yeah and it just spilled out of him and

went into the course through your veins

and your arteries and you walk out of

there thinking wow that was the most

interesting thing I've ever done in my

life you don't even care what you get on

a test after that because you got

touched and you became an enlightened

participant in that exercise in that

exploration yeah it's just so hard for

them to even get kids attentions though

yes unfortunately hatches going on

unfortunate that could be in some places

half the energy of the teachers is

maintaining order I think the success of

your book the success of your show your

podcast and many of these other really

intelligent podcasts are showing though

there's an appetite for this stuff out

there yeah and I'm delighted to be a

servant of that curiosity and this I

brought this just because it's not even

out yet this the you're airing like now

live this is it you're alive you are

okay so this is like a five-second delay

what is this accessory to war oh this

this is like another book I just this is

coming out in three weeks

is this about space war accessory to war

the unspoken alliance between

astrophysics and the military ah yeah so

so this other book was astrophysics for

people in a hurry if you're in a hurry

do not buy people in a hurry this is not

this is not what this is not an impulse

item at the checkout line this is you

got this is this is all about by the way

we know what role the physicist plays in

war the physicist makes the bomb invents

the bomb the chemist perfects napalm the

biologists weaponize --is anthrax and

the astrophysicist

well we sit at the end of a telescope

and wait for photons to cross the

universe and enter our detector and we

go into conferences and argue about them

so there is no obvious connection

between what we do and military strength

hegemony dominance empire building it's

just not obvious that's why this

subtitle is the unspoken Alliance it's

not a secret it's just it's not there

it's there but it's not nobody's talking

about it do you realize I'll just give

an example okay if you needed more

reasons to think that Columbus was a

dick okay let me add one to it when we

were kids on today yeah I know I know

but actually I do have something smiled

Lee redeeming to offer about Columbus if

you have the time I just wanted okay

okay

start off with that you want me start

out with that well how you want to do it

I'll do the dick part okay so on his

third voyage he's in by the time as of

his third voyage he had already planted

enough Spanish flags that Spain had

already begun to set up governments and

infrastructures in these places

he had found ya basically conquered and

so so in one of the places I'd was it's

in the book accurately but they think

it's Hispaniola one of the island today

he has to get back as his third voice

1503 or 1504 he's got to get back to

Spain he doesn't have enough resources

not enough food for his crew so he asked

the natives would you please give us

some of your stock that you have

collected from your farming now this

particular group of natives only makes

exactly the amount of food they need to

tie to the next crop

they don't have surplus so they said no

we don't have surplus sorry Columbus

knew that one week hence coincidentally

there was going to be a total lunar

eclipse with a moon in its orbit around

Earth enters Earth's shadow the full

moon enters Earth's shadow and

disappears and that the geometry of that

event it's just a simple lunar eclipse

but the geometry says that sunlight

passes around Earth through Earth's

atmosphere and takes on sunset colors

that leech into Earth's shadow giving

the moon if you can see it at all a deep

red amber hue almost the color of blood

Columbus set and he knew about this

because he had read the tables the

Eclipse tables all right we'd known

enough about the solar system at the

time too we got that okay actually back

then it was just the known world with

earth in the middle of the known

universe that didn't matter the rhythms

of the universe were known he says to

the natives if you do not give us food

my god which is more powerful than your

God will make the moon disappear and it

will turn blood red that will happen in

one week you have one week to comply

some of them were skeptical what you

can't what others said [ __ ] we got it to

what this guy says look at the ships

they came in their guns their power

their their culture look what they've

got sure enough right on cue

the moon begins to disappear according

to that that is a famous woodcut that

you know you got this Oh some those

viewing the video of this yeah there's a

famous woodcut and notice the natives

bowing to him and he stands proudly cuz

he knows the science he knows the

astronomy he knew this and so he invokes

this to dominate people who are not yet

scientifically literate and within

seconds of this beginning they bring him

all the resources he wants and he gets

and I we don't know what happened you

know back at the island whether the

people survived the winter but he got

back to the island that is one microcosm

of a set of ways that the universe has

been invoked in this I'll give you

another example los alamos one of the

National Labs they today as basically

since their inception are charged with

tracking the nuclear arsenal of the

United States our nuclear power the

nukes that would go into nuclear weapons

they think about this do you realize

they hire astrophysicist I had

colleagues work in there you know why

because there's a room there are two

rooms

I mean I'm simplifying this but

basically there are two rooms adjacent

to one another and a computer between

the two of them the most powerful

computers in the world and there is code

running on those computers that

calculates the energy yields of hydrogen

fusion that's exactly what an

astrophysicist cares about when stars

blow up okay the Sun is undergoing

nuclear fusion right now and that's how

it's making energy and when that when

high mass stars dies they explode as

supernovae this is a natural thing going

on then you over in the universe on the

other side that's a classified room

they are calculating yields of hydrogen

bombs and they have lunch together and

they compare notes the government

doesn't always have the best people but

if you hire some of the best people to

do whatever it is they want and their

calculations happen to relate to a

military project there you have a

two-way street in progress

why do you think the Hubble telescope

that the the mirror issues

notwithstanding which were ultimately

fixed when it was first launched why was

that so successful viewer versions of

the Hubble telescope previously launched

by the military looking down that that

the model for that telescope had already

been conceived and built and was

operating then we said oh we want one of

those okay but we don't that's not

public that this is going on we design

the telescope gets designed it has the

benefit of previous versions of it

having been used successfully but

looking down and we look up this is the

perennial two-way street of astronomy in

the old days and in modern times

astrophysics and the invention of the

telescope you ever said anything yet oh

you just you look you're a good listener

should I keep just keep talking by

preventing you from interrupting okay

fine Galileo perfects the telescope he

learned that it had just been invented

in the Netherlands the the Dutch were

were opticians all right so they

invented the telescope and the

microscope within a couple of years of

one another this transformed science

when did they invent the eyeglass the

reading glass the reading glasses

earlier than that but I don't I don't

know when's that the real advance was

putting two lenses in line with one

another sounds trivial in modern times

but that was a huge leap conceptual leap

and what you would accomplish and in so

doing

depending on how you curve them and how

you grind them grind the the shape of

those lenses you would get a microscope

or a telescope and and we're off to the

races that's basically the birth of

modern science as we now think of it and

and and and conduct it because you say

to yourself my senses I don't trust them

to be the full record of what's going on

in front of me you pull out a microscope

oh my gosh leeuwen Hoch he got the

microscope guy he thought he got a drop

of pond water puts it under his

microscope just to think to do this it's

just water

why do you think that's something

interesting to do he said I wonder he

was curious he puts it under and sees

little what he described as anima cules

happily of swimming anima cute anima

culés

these are like the amoebas in paramecia

and oh oh it is and so he writes he

reports on this to to the you know the

scientific authorities and they don't

believe him they say you know Van

Leeuwen hook we think you might have had

too much gin before you wrote this

letter why would anyone believe this

that there's entire creatures an entire

universe of creatures thriving in a drop

of pond water and so the way science

works is one report does not make it

true you need verification they sent

people to the Netherlands to verify his

results and there was the birth of

microscopy and then they looked at

everything cells you know they need

vocabulary to describe what you're now

seeing well that was the the journey

down small then the journey went up big

and Galileo perfects the telescope he

looks up as whoa I see craters mountains

valleys on the moon the Sun has spots

Venus goes through phases

this became the corpus of evidence for

earth going around the Sun in support of

Copernicus idea that earth went around

the Sun my point is what was the second

thing he did with his telescope he

telephone no he he contacted the Doge of

Venice invited him to the clock tower

and said look at what this instrument

can do for you as we look out into the

lagoon you can identify a ship's

intentions friend or foe by its flag 10

times farther away then you can with the

unaided eye Venice bought a boatload of

these telescopes in the service of their

military defense and this was a source

of money to Galileo and now he could go

look at the universe this has been a

two-way street ever since people have

looked up so this is this is an

accounting of that this is it's and it

goes on and on the first x-ray machines

for airports you're old enough to

remember what

why would they put in because of

hijackings to Cuba basically that they

were armed hijackings of airplanes of

American carriers to Cuba and Congress

that we got to do something about that

oh by the way there's a company in

Boston called American science and

engineering that was building an x-ray

detector small enough to put on a

satellite to observe the universe in

x-rays and because no one had moved use

visible light but not x-ray that's a

branch of the electromagnetic spectrum

we think if their black holes out there

their region surrounding them will give

us x-rays it's a new window on the

universe and then they said oh my gosh

there's a call for x-ray machines at

Airport we've got the technology that

we've perfected to put in a fricken

satellite so the technology for those

ones you walk through the airport

initially came initially yes yes yes

there was a two-way street there was oh

my gosh we need this for security oh my

god we would we were using let's split

let's apply that technology to these

detectors well that's been a lot of the

stuff with the space program right a lot

of the stuff that they devised for use

on the space station and some many other

technologies have trickled their way

down in the break well that's our and

that always happens and even some simple

things because people say why spend

money up there and we should be spending

it down here but there's interesting

fact here that is almost never discussed

the people who still think about the

universe and study the universe are

hugely creative and the creative

energies cannot be pre prescribed you

can't go to a create you might but I

don't know that you'll get their maximum

creativity say I need you to invent a

cure for cancer right now use that

brilliance I'll try but the greatest

discoveries the greatest cures the

greatest of these comes from a

cross-pollination

of interest that people have that where

they were engaged because they were

interest interested just for the sake of

being interested so watch out here's an

example the Space Shuttle it's it's a

glider when it lands okay it's got no

engines it's got flaps there's a little

bit of brakes and the tires but that's

about it when it comes in okay how do

you make sure the thing that stays on

track because they kept drifting in

winds and this sort of thing and so they

said why don't we groove the road so

that the rubber on the road the the the

runway so the rubber can align with the

grooves and stay in a straight line

because rubber doesn't slide well when

you have doesn't slide sideways very

easily on crews when they realize how

effective that was it's now put on off

ramps to freeways if there's a freeway

off-ramp that's a little tight not quite

banked well enough it's gonna be grooved

check it out next time and you could say

well okay that's pretty simple low-tech

solution why didn't we why couldn't we

just discover that on our own without

the twenty billion dollar a year space

agency called NASA but you didn't you

didn't power tools

cordless high torque power tools were

invented to service satellites in orbit

by NASA because you can't just plug it

into 120 volt socket when you're

floating in space so the engineer said

how are we gonna solve this problem

let's make a high torque power tool so

now NASA invents the height now that is

the only way you're buying a power tool

today is that is the cordless variety

all construction sites they're not

looking for a power outlet for these

things so why didn't we invent this

without the twenty billion dollar space

right you didn't you weren't you didn't

think about it you said oh I can plug it

in this is great you're not even

thinking what you need so yes there are

all of these applications but but I

don't that's a good reason to do it but

I don't think it's the best way the best

reasons are my gosh don't you want to

keep dreaming don't you want to keep

looking into the future that would be

ideal

but that's not attractive to people that

are spending tax dollars when it comes

to tax dollars people get super

pragmatic and they go why do we need to

go to Mars now what we need to do is

take care of this and pay for that and

we were the deficit and the budget and

you know so you know NASA's budget today

is four tenths of one percent of the

federal budget so

you take a dollar or a tense one I will

quantify everybody take a dollar bill

and imagine that's your tax dollar and

you can like cut it to whatever percent

you want so let's cut four tenths of one

percent off of the edge that doesn't get

you into the ink you're still in the

border around it all right even notice

that you would even though you could

trim that off the dollar and pay for

anything pay for it so my point is most

of the people who say don't spend it

here spend it there they think NASA has

more budget than it actually does they

just they there if you ask them how much

they think any oh ten percent five

percent you know several percent no it's

one-half of one percent so if you're

gonna tell me that if you can take that

four tenths of one percent and spend it

in these other problems and solve them I

would say yeah go right ahead but is

this is this where you really want to

pull the money from when it's the only

thing that Gaza is thinking about

tomorrow as just thinking about a future

well forgot like you that's super

important but for a guy who lives in

Cleveland who doesn't give a [ __ ] about

science oh excuse me that's like the

person who says okay I don't need the

space program

why don't I need a space for it I have

my cell phone and I have the Weather

Channel and I'd know anything I need

this is yeah you're using GPS satellites

to understand where you are on this

earth you to understand where grandma's

house is when you pull out of it who

created what who created spread spectrum

technology that led the GPS and Wi-Fi

who is that

hedy lamarr old I didn't know that yes

yes she's actress 1941 yes she did

recognize for reminding me super hot

though that was the problem nobody cared

yeah but yeah it took it would take

decades to really realize that GPS is

launched by the military and it's now

hundreds of billions of dollars worth of

the American economy thriving on this

space application but it was a military

intent then it was to navigate the

surface of the earth yeah to navigate

and the first Gulf War was the first big

use of space assets

in the conduct of military operations I

believe in even when hedy lamarr created

it with another scientist the idea

behind it was for encoded

encoded transcriptions or encoded

information during the war well so that

that's a big challenge how do you encode

information that's by the way the future

of this might might come from it's not

it's still not clear the jury's still

out and they're sort of opposing views

on this but you know you've heard about

quantum entangled particles yeah where I

can create a pair of particles that know

about one another and now they separated

in space and in time and if you observe

that other particle it instantly changes

the state of the particle BEC the other

particle that's back where I am and by

the way that they communicate

instantaneously faster than the speed of

light when you say if you observed do

you mean that if you observe it with

anything doesn't matter but you have to

do something you have to do yes so

something has to interact with it's not

Wu into Renault sir but it's so not what

people but you say that people go yeah

if I saw that in a secret yeah so the

problem is the word observed people

thinks is a psychological thing but in

physics it's got nothing it's a

measurement it's a measurement thing

right and so little measuring if there's

a if there's an electron sitting in the

middle of this table and all the lights

are out I can say I think there's an

electron here let me find out and the

moment I turn on the lights the light

interacts a photon interacts with the

electron and kicks it somewhere else so

the more I try to measure its position

the less I know its position so because

you need to the measurement requires an

interaction with it and on in the

quantum scale interactions change the

state of the experiment that you're

conducting we know this we've quantified

it we don't like it but we deal with it

and then the act of dealing with it you

can exploit that fact for other purposes

we exploit quantum craziness to birth

the inductee the information technology

revolution there is no creation storage

or retrieval of information without an

exploitation of the quantum

so and by the way the quantum was

discovered in quantum physics as a

branch of physics was discovered in the

1920s if you were around back then and

your tax buddies who don't like paying

taxes you what would you have said why

are you spending government money on her

on the a demand on molecules if you

can't even see them what good is it all

I can't but would work I just care about

my wood atoms right here I am yeah yeah

shove that where your where your tax

dollar is and so it would look like

you're wasting your own time and

everybody else's money it would take

decades five decades of four or five

decades before we would realize what

role that would play in computing this

creation storage and retrieval of

information and by some measures it's a

third of the world's GDP is traceable to

what quantum physics does for us on a

computing scale so anyone yes

yes well I mean you there ways to do it

there's certain industries that would

still be there without computing but

they're made more efficient with it okay

so UPS tracks all of their trucks with

GPS and with computing devices that

invokes the quantum but UPS predates the

use of this these tools but you can look

at profits relative to their

efficiencies that are enabled by these

technologies as well as entire fields

that didn't exist before computing you

add all that up it's a stunning fact and

so my only point is that you if you want

today to say why study this when we have

these other problems all I do like all I

do is take you back to the cave and

let's say all right we're in a cave and

there's a mountain over there in a

valley and I tell you I tell the truth

at the cave that I tell the tribe

leaders I want to explore that mountain

in that valley no we can't afford to

send you out there now we have to solve

the cave problems first before anyone

leaves the cave we laugh at that that's

an absurd claim to make in caveman days

I don't know if anyone did it but that's

a crazy thought

their solutions to your problems that

might exist and time has demonstrated

likely exist by leaving the cave that

you can then discover so for me exploits

is not just space all the frontiers of

the unknown biology chemistry a I accept

you know those frontiers and then you

can cross pollinate them and transform

civilization and then the last example I

give then I'll shut up cuz I want to

hear you talk to I got I don't get I

want to hear you interact with what I'm

telling here's one you ready okay my

physics professor in college study the

universe love the universe study gas

clouds between stars and studied how

would you detect a gas cloud if it's not

radiating light will they give off radio

waves all right and he figured out what

kind of radio waves they give off and

why and in this he gained expertise in

the nucleus of the atom and he

discovered that the nucleus can resonate

depending on the mass of the nucleus it

will which means depending on what atom

it is on the periodic table it will

resonate slightly differently when

exposed to the same electromagnetic

field he discovered a new phenomenon in

physics called nuclear magnetic

resonance it would then take a clever

medical technologist to say wait a

minute if you can distinguish one heavy

atom from another let me make a machine

out of that put your body in it and I

can then distinguish one kind of tissue

from another and thus was born the

magnetic resonance imager the MRI

arguably the most potent tool in the

arsenal of modern medicine where I can

diagnose a condition in your body

without cutting you open first that is

based on a principle of physics

discovered by a physicist who had no

interest in medicine by the way the real

title should be nuclear magnetic

resonance imaging but that's the other N

word you're not so you don't like that

people don't like nuclear they're less

likely to go inside the machine if the

word nuclear was on it but my my point

is that was

cross-pollination of ideas with clever

people on their frontiers looking over

the fence at discoveries that are being

made it's how we got the microwave oven

that wasn't invented by a thermodynamic

system I CRO waves this is a world war

two attempt to communicate using

microwaves and they found out some guys

chocolate bar melted in the microwave

field and they said what happened there

and they did some more tests and of

course the water molecule and other

molecules common in food respond to

microwaves it vibrates them ferociously

and so you put food in a microwave

cavity the water content of the food

vibrates friction cooks the food there's

still people who today we say Oh nucleus

because I think it's so fast and they

have no fear it's just friction

okay friction it yeah and everybody's

scared that it [ __ ] up the food well

does it no it's just it just heats the

water get scared the whoohoo people do

okay so here's the thing there's certain

foods that don't respond well to the

flipping of the water molecule and one

of them is like bread products it's hard

yeah it gets chewy and leathery yeah and

only if you like over do what you got to

do it just right and you're still good

if you overdo it you can get led that's

kind of it I'm trying to think you

wouldn't grill a steak in a microwave

you would heat up the meat uniformly and

that's that's all it would do cooks

bacon pretty fast yeah but it's a mess

and it splatters all over so you pick

the foods that are best for that

situation as you would pick the food's

best you wouldn't you wouldn't put toast

in an oven at 350 degrees to bread to

make toast

we have toasters for that right so

different things in your kitchen do

things best you wouldn't make ice cream

and your you know and your spin your

toaster oven but people were afraid of

microwaves the one thing they're afraid

of it's not it's not as they're afraid

of microwaves that they're afraid that

of things they don't understand

they're afraid that something's gonna

happen to their food that makes it less

good correct and it's just it's it's

nothing not knowing that people fear my

wife's friend's mom

will not eat something that comes out of

a microwave really she quotes that as

part of what makes her healthy it drinks

a lot of water she refuses to eat

microwave food the whole life is around

not using microwave she won't eat

anything that comes out of her Michael

okay I'm glad that she doesn't you know

she'll she can live a long happy life as

such seems to reheat food old-school

okay one of the hardest thing is

reheating lasagna if you don't have a

microwave Oh true

that's like impostor you can equip it

again you're gonna cook it again yeah

that's a really good point so I think

microwave ovens were invented for

leftover lasagna mmm yeah just a bowl of

pasta just in general yeah

soup yes sweet for soup was good yeah so

you don't have to worry about it it's

not doing anything to it it's not not

sucking any nutrients out or adding any

nuclear radiation correct okay there's

nothing with radiation in the normal

sense other than electromagnetic

radiation it's already light from the

bulb we tend to use radiation in the

context of stuff that would hurt you so

that would be radiation of high enough

energy to hurt you and microwaves are

not in that category I never even

thought about what microwaves do until

this conversation really yeah yeah so

it's a certain frequency of microwaves

that beautifully pairs with the water

molecule and it vibrates it brilliantly

so it doesn't work for completely dried

things

yeah that's why if you put something

that has no water in it it's not really

very useful it happens it's white eve

jerky it's there's still some moisture

in it correct it's why it heats the food

and not the plate

if the plate gets hot it's not because

the microwave oven heated the plate it's

because the foods hit the food and the

food that's why I can usually pick it up

at the handles you can put food on a

paper plate that's right

it doesn't burst a flame doesn't burst

into flame this is crazy

you didn't Joe what is it between MRI

and fMRI oh so an FM I don't claim total

expertise here but I'll tell you the

little I know that MRI they put you in

there in your stationery and then they

make this map of whatever part of the

body they're studying is typically your

head all right but you can do it other

for your joints in other parts of your

body that might require this level of

three-dimensional analysis and it's it's

a 3d map of what's going on in the part

that they surveyed and so you look at it

through slices through that section so

you might see in MRIs of your brain of

your skull and they take slices you as

the slices go through you see like the

eye socket come in and then go out again

or the the nose cavity and and you can

look at it in all three dimensions front

to back side to side up to down so so

depending on the sophistication of the

machine fMRI is they are looking at your

brain while you were thinking so time is

now an active coordinate of what's going

on and they're measuring it as they're

talking to you but correct so they say

oh think the ice cream sundae with a

cherry on top but think of a naked

person who you'd want to have sex with

and the F stands for functional right

and so it's basically a real-time

observation of what's going on Viktor

person there was a woman in India it's

really a highly criticized case but she

was convicted of a crime I believe it

was murder because she had functional

knowledge of the crime scene and the

arguments against it were like if you're

gonna be accused of a crime clearly

you're gonna study the evidence you're

gonna talk to a lawyer you're gonna go

over some things you're gonna be I don't

know if fMRI is that precise yeah it is

that's why you're very disturbing that

this was used in court it's like do you

remember when these Italian

geologists were I think they were tried

because they should have known about an

earthquake before it happened and then

scientists had to say hey guys this is

not how it works like this [ __ ] can just

happen yeah that's so that no I don't

but that's what I do know let me share a

couple of things with you that I've

thought deeply about recently there are

three kinds of truths in the world okay

cuz we're in it like a tree let me give

you three okay the rudy guiliani

okay ready true isn't always true I know

so let me try to okay unpack that okay

you ready okay

alternative facts I did something called

an objective truth an objective truth is

something that is true whether or not

you believe in it and the methods and

tools of science are uniquely conceived

to seek out and establish objective

truths and this I'm in referring to the

invocation of the scientific method

no one scientific result result research

result it's true until it is verified by

other people's research results using a

different experimental method with

different wall current from another

country when your competitor says I

think you're wrong let me show how

you're wrong and they would reproduce

your experiment and get the same result

when you have generally the same results

emerging that is a newly discovered

objective truth about the natural world

and when you have objective truths

they're not later shown to be false hmm

that's an objective truth then you have

personal truths these are truths that

you hold dearly Jesus is your Savior

Muhammad is the final prophet on earth

you you know Abraham is your these are

your personal truths there's a heaven

you're going to no one is going to take

that from you not in a free country

where freedom of expression and speech

and religion is protected mm-hmm that's

a personal truth the problem here is you

can't convince someone else of your

personal truth without some act of

persuasion and in the limit and

act of violence hmm okay in the limit in

the limit this I get holy wars so I have

this personal truth and I require that

you share my personal truth but why is

that's a recipe for disaster and not a

belief because the people who hold a

belief will tell you that it's a truth

so I don't want to take that usage of

the word away from them okay so you're

giving them a beautiful nation I'm

giving them the word truth but modifying

it to say personal truth that's correct

I'm not gonna think they've used it that

way for millennia I'm not gonna hmm okay

they they feel that is true and it's

true in their bones I'm simply saying

that because it's your personal truth

you cannot require that someone else

share it and in this country because in

the United States because God is not

mentioned in the Constitution itself a

controversial thing in its day by the

way actually God is mentioned but it in

a very insignificant way that the

Constitution is a godfrey document and

because it's a godfrey document it

protects your expression of religious

faith because it means the government

has no say in who and what you believe

or why if the Constitution said mention

God and Jesus well there it is there's

Christianity built into the fabric of

the country and if you want to be some

other religion you're gonna have a hard

time because we can set laws against it

this is why so many religiously

persecuted people came to the United

States to escape their country where

they could not practice their religion a

little differently or a lot differently

from what was going on in their home to

in their homeland so that is it a

problem though to call it truth I would

rather not call the truth but I I'm I'm

a big word guy and I respect what

happens to words I don't always like it

but I respect it and so I'm gonna say

there's an objective truth which is true

whether or not you believe it

there's your personal truth which is

true to you third truth is a political

truth political truth is something that

is true because it has been incessantly

repeated

it's and then you just believe it that

what okay what's Hillary Clinton's first

name it's crooked her first name is

actually Hillary okay I thought it was

crooked Hillary this is was incessantly

repeated in the Trump campaign uh-huh

and that that's an absurd example of it

but but but the point is if you keep

saying if you keep saying that the New

York Times is fake news they just keep

saying that eventually people believe it

and it becomes a political truth because

the politicians repeated it so it's a

political truth that people believe it

or it's a political truth because people

believe it which one is it so again

you're you're you try to ret you're

trying to preserve the true fundamental

meaning of the word truth yeah

and I've just given up on that Jordan

Peterson and sam Harris had

infuriatingly frustrating podcast where

they went over the meaning of the word

truth for more than an hour and I like I

said you can do that and philosophers

like arguing and debating meaning of

things for me it's how our people are

using the word that's the meaning okay I

I concede that well we can wait it sings

why I don't call myself an atheist it's

why you can look up the dictionary

definition of atheists and it kind of

applies to me but what is the definition

of atheist in practice it is what

leading atheists do and it's their

conduct and it's their behavior that's

what they say and it's it's it's their

attitude mm-hmm that is what an atheist

is today because they are the most

visible exemplars of that word and most

of their conduct I either don't agree

with or simply don't engage in what

don't you agree with I don't debate

religious people and tell them they're

idiots hmm I don't that doesn't work

whether or not it works that's just not

it's not in me to do that I I don't

purge myself of words that have

religious foundations in them I once in

my facebook I had a friend going up in

orbit to repair the Hubble telescope one

of the astronauts and I said

Godspeed mm-hmm and then I gave the

astronauts name people wrote in in the

thread said I thought you were an

atheist how can you say Godspeed

an atheist got angry with me and I said

okay first of all this phrase is deeply

historical in the space program when

John Glenn was launched the headline was

god speed John Glenn mmm and every

mission where we sent human beings into

space somewhere there is that reference

in the NASA fancy word means I'll tell

you I'll tell you what it means please

do okay so oh by the way I'll get to

that in just one minute any time the

atheists who are arguing that I was

using God's speed as a phrase they all

have used the phrase goodbye haven't

they see you later goodbye where does

that word come from it's from God be

with you it's a contraction of those

three words and why would you say this

you would say this to someone leaving

the city wall where it's dangerous

okay back when you have city-states

you're going to your God be with you to

bring protection for you between one

city one and corrals look out for you so

now what is the source of danger if

you're going to space it's not alien

space muggers it is the fact that you

have space Marauders it's the fact that

you have high speed and high speed is

the source of essentially any death of

anything that's in motion if you were a

part of that disaster so God speed is

like a space equivalent to God be with

you really the origin was just saying

did they say that before there was space

travel did they say God speed I don't

know the actual origin of space travel

of the term I don't know how far back it

goes but I do know it became common

after John Glenn because they're not

gonna say it to Yuri Gagarin because

they were they're all a theists in in

the soviet union i but here in america

in america god speed John Glenn and I

respect that tradition hmm and so I said

that and then they jumped so if a

theists are jumping on me for having

said that clearly I'm not an atheist

and ask me my favorite Broadway musical

of all time what's your favorite Jesus

Christ Superstar and I and I still use

BC and AD in my writings okay

I still do it don't use BCE I don't use

BCE hmm all right well see even you cut

cop attitude right there right yeah hmm

I saw your face you know I'll tell you

why okay okay first of all doesn't make

any sense BCE is not the current era

2,000 years ago I'm going to tell you so

BCE as you know stands for before Common

Era right and c e stands for Common Era

so this is d religious of fiying ad and

BC NB C right okay yet of course they

reference the same calendar right okay

well who invented the calendar we all

currently use in modern society it's

called the Gregorian calendar it was

invented by the Catholic Church by

Jesuit priest in the 1580s assigned by

Pope Gregory to fix the problems in the

calendar because I'm screaming at you

here you can start it's green get crazy

I gotta calm down I'll bring in coffee

the Julian calendar put forth in ancient

Rome had one modification to previous

calendars it had a leap day okay it had

a leap day and okay leap day is how

often every four years this was good

because what are we trying to track

we're trying to earth goes around the

Sun and so we say all right how long

does that take well it takes a year but

it turns out we're not actually tracking

how long it takes earth to go around the

Sun without tracking how long it takes

earth to repeat its seasons and the

repeat the year that corresponds to our

seasons is slightly different from the

year that corresponds to how long it

takes to go around the Sun slightly

different and that difference was not

recognized in the early calendars and

that difference accumulated so that by

the year fifteen eighty four the vernal

equinox the first day of spring did not

occur on March 21st it occurred

March 10th it shifted from the calendar

date that's what happens if you don't

match the cycles of things and the Pope

said we're not having any of this

especially since Easter might land on

Passover and we try to distinguish

ourselves mightily from the Jews so

let's fix this the Jesuit priest got to

study this they looked at the cycles of

the heavens the Sun the Moon the Stars

and they came up with a new calendar the

Gregorian calendar a modification to the

Julian calendar you know what they have

to do to invoke it that to take ten days

out of the calendar to jumpstart to put

the first day of spring back on March

21st

then this happened inoctober 1584 why is

there babies on ten days out of the

calendar so now how much rent do you pay

they have to like invent amortized rent

yeah cuz you're gonna pay for three

weeks instead you know twenty days

instead of 30 did they have to figure

that out

okay point is this was hard-earned and

the whole world uses this calendar it is

the most accurate calendar ever devised

you know yes I'll tell you what okay you

asked so watch what happens the leap day

overcorrected the calendar it over

corrected it over correct yes yes so you

need a leap here so no so the leap day

is every four years that one day every

four years was slowly putting too many

days into the moments into the year okay

the Gregorian calendar figured this out

and it had put ten extra days since the

Julian calendar to the Gregorian

calendar ten extra days first jumpstart

get rid of the ten days now everything's

lined up again okay now how do you

prevent this from happening again

because it over corrects how long do you

have to wait to remove a leap day that

you would otherwise put in okay okay

that's every hundred years

oh so every hundred years that would be

a leap day you remove the leap day now

turns out that under corrects it by an

even smaller amount okay so how long do

you have to wait before you have to put

a leap day back in ever

400 years Oh God so the year 2000 was a

century year which normally would not

have a leap day except it's a century

year evenly divisible by 400 so they put

the leap day back in and everybody on

February almost everybody everybody

except the astronomers on February 29th

in the year 2000 set it's just a leap

year because it's divisible by 4 no it

is a rarely Pierre

it is a century year divisible by 400

that corrects it back and so now you

have a stable calendar for tens of

thousands of years I gotta give props to

the Jesuit priest I'm not gonna say no

I'm taking the Christianity out of this

reference because they figured out the

calendar that we all use and it's a

[ __ ] awesome count sorry to drop an

f-bomb so I'm not just because some

atheists are telling me that Rid God out

of everything in the universe that I'm

not I'm not doing that

I'm going to say they came up with this

calendar the reasons were because they

didn't want to confuse it with Passover

the motivation is whatever it is but the

sciences is good and so there it is so

in accessori to war where we go back

many centuries the editors said well we

should use BCE cuz as a liberal forward

thing I said I am not using BCE and see

yep and by the way then there was no

year 0 you know why there's no year 0

because the Romans came up with the

calendar and they counted using Roman

numerals and Roman numerals don't have a

zero oh it was not yet invented no no so

it went from 1 BC to AD 1 VC's before

Christ

ad is anno domini in Latin the year of

our Lord Wow yeah now of course in Islam

and in China and in in Hebrew cultures

Israel in particular they have access to

the Chinese calendar the Muslim calendar

Muslim of course dates to Muhammad

Chinese calendar dates to actually a

planetary alignment in 4,700 BC if they

don't they use a different system I use

a different system that's why

and the Hebrew calendar dates to like

the beginning of the universe as

interpreted in the in the Torah so they

have access to those but when the

conducting international business would

just simply use the Gregorian calendar

just get over it but use it in China do

they use it constantly and consistently

or do they alternate between the

Gregorian calendar and something else

I'm not a Chinese expert but from what I

know of China and my friends and

colleagues they have for conducting

business the world's business is

conducted in on the Gregorian calendar

with the 12-month calendar with with the

year as referenced by everybody else and

does it have to be done that way in

terms of like is there is anyone ever

done a study on possibly creating a more

effective more accurate calendar it

doesn't invoke leap years and the

problem is the length of the day does

not cut evenly to the time it takes

earth to go around the Sun so there will

always be fractions of days that you're

accumulating right and now what do you

do with them you wait till you

accumulate a day and you put it in or

take it out what did the Mayan this is

enough isn't a lunar cycle calendar it

was that accounted abased on Venus and

so yeah that a really good calendar yeah

it was overstated than it was like the

really accurate count overstated

overstate it was good better than

anything that came before and not as

good as the ignorant no no Gregorian

Kevin

people love old [ __ ] though they do and

they want to believe that especially

people who you know you want to believe

the people 5,000 years ago somehow knew

more about the universe than we do yeah

just know why is that why they wanted to

believe that I think I don't know for me

that's one of the great puzzles of life

why do people want to believe that the

Egyptians somehow had some access to the

universe well they knew something Martin

they of course they definitely knew how

to find some incredible [ __ ] course

right but that yep oh I don't take that

away from doesn't the physical just the

presence of these incredible buildings

leave the possibility that maybe they

had some knowledge that we lost lost

knowledge is a real thing yeah I don't

want to belittle or diminish the

significance of real knows we forgot how

to draw in perspective you know

from ancient times had to be

rediscovered in the as I understand from

the artists had to be rediscovered in

the Renaissance the archway the the

Roman arch had to sort of be

rediscovered okay so yes yes you can

lose knowledge but if you look at the

knowledge we have gleaned using the

methods and modern methods and tools of

science that go far beyond our five

senses in our access to the world to say

that somehow they knew something that we

don't using our tools that's just false

sorry that's just it's just that it's

not possible but we know the

physiological limits of your ability to

know what's going on around you right

and there people say oh I have a sixth

sense fine but as a scientist I have

dozens of senses right okay I can

measure things that your five senses

can't I can measure the magnetic field

around you their electromagnetic field

how much microwaves are coursing through

your body now we have no sensors for

this I can see auras fine I can see

other things that are affecting your

body now I can tell you if ionizing

radiation is passing through you I have

Geiger counters that can do that you

can't

oh you'll finally you'll eventually

learn whether you're exposed to ionizing

radiation because you're you'll get

cancer of your organs and your limbs

fall off all right I concede that we

know far more today yes perhaps

no not even perhaps then at any other

time yes inconceivable history yes but

it is possible that they knew some

things like how to build a pyramid yes

that we really just don't understand

today I don't know what it means to not

understand how to build a pyramid today

we have we have we have 150 story

building so we're not thinking about

pyramid stuff I can tell you this do you

know whether the first thing that was

built by humans ever no no the that's

only part of the sins sorry I love your

enthusiasm my sense only barely came out

of my mouth

the tallest thing humans built after the

pyramids I think it's a building in

Dubai No

so in other words what's the next tell

this thing after the pyramids oh right

after yeah what is the next tallest

thing we built stable structure after

the pyramids what the Eiffel Tower

well yes 18 whatever at eighty nine

eighteen said late 1800s in Paris the

Eiffel Tower huh that was the first

stable structure we built as a

civilization that was taller than the

pyramids so the Egyptians new pad and a

new architecture they knew no one's

taking that away from them but to claim

they have some secret knowledge of the

functionings of the universe no no well

people love seeing that kind of stuff

yeah it makes for a great TV but the

fact that they didn't have steel and the

fact that you're dealing with the very

very most recent 2500 BC and they built

you just have to be more ingenious more

interview yes and we otherwise would

have to be yeah how do you move the

blocks howdy how they make Stonehenge

those those rocks are nowhere in the

region mm-hmm they were carted from

somewhat they found a place where those

rocks were would have been mined removed

and yeah those are some big-ass rocks

yeah as are the one but it's not less

impressive because they're just big like

what the the thing about the pyramids is

so impressive is the precision and the

sheer numbers two million our best

hunters hundred thousand stones our best

understanding of Stonehenge is that it's

a functioning observatory that can

actually predict eclipses so did I get

just good yeah bitch-slap you there

[Laughter]

solstice they have there are holes that

are not stones but they're 56 holes

which is three times the the serous

which is the cycle of eclipses of the

matching of the orbits of the Sun and

the moon in the sky of the paths of the

Sun and the moon in the sky and when

they match up you get in Eclipse is

there is this an observatory guy named

that's absolutely what it is there's a

book published in this in the 1970s by a

guy named

David Dawkins it's not Richard Dawkins

but it's another one of these Hawking's

a rich Richard Hawkins Richard Hawkins

Hawking Hawking Hawking's damn when I'm

dudes damn what well we got our top

crack researchers here just look up that

the Taliban's book with stonehenge

decoded just look up the title a book

anyhow it's highly convincing and we all

were all there with it there's no it's

essentially just a study of the position

of the stones in relationship to the

where the okay Carol Gerald Hawkins

thank you yeah Stonehenge decoded so he

visited Stonehenge as a kid at age

fifteen on an expedition and he was the

expedition head oh wow yeah so how lucky

for you yeah it was it was good and that

stuck with me which is why I named this

phenomenon in Manhattan where the Sun

sets along the stress yeah yeah so so I

named it Manhattanhenge sort of

harkening back to my early days thinking

about the alignment of the Sun and

structures that we might build so twice

a year for those viewers or listeners

who don't know twice a year the

Manhattan Street grid which is not

perfectly aligned north-south the

Manhattan Street grid will that the Sun

will set exactly on the grid and I'll

agree and what's up there now that image

what's not obvious is that picture is

taken along a street that is itself

three miles long and then you're

crossing a the Hudson River and then

there's New Jersey on the other side so

people try to zoom in on it but really

what you really should do is zoom out

from it and then you get the vanishing

point on it so yeah all those are zoom

zoomed in let's go to yeah that one

looks more like like my photo I go back

to that other one yeah see so so that's

on 34th Street the one you see now and

then you get this sparkling effect that

happens twice a year twice like that

sort of crazy wild light effect yes it

looks yes Photoshop dolls yeah

there's an image on his Instagram that

is linked on my Instagram the most

recent photo okay

there he goes oh there's you with the

selfie selfie right oh yeah so come on

down for a fro oh yeah that's strong

that was my first cell phone yeah I was

fourteen four let me see it was nineteen

probably 1974 Wow so I would have been

15 I think I've been 14 or 15 so your

path of curiosity was set back that goes

back very early right but that's nothing

what we're looking for here let's go but

that one thinking it is so that no

there's another one but go back to all

of these rivers Wow zoom back out it's

you see all the pictures there you go to

the bottom left there you go okay that

might be the first ever Manhattanhenge

photo what is that from I took that in

2001 right - and it got published in

2002 before September 11th this is July

I took it before September 11th right

right and then I had a means to publish

it and right then the notice that it's a

green light and traffic is ready to

knock me over so so no one is in the

streets doing this but now there are

tens of thousands of people that pour

into the streets on these days we post

what day you're getting Manhattanhenge

from the American Museum of Natural

History my day job and then that goes

out the press gets it and tens of

thousands of people spin with the street

blocking traffic and if you think of all

the ways traffic gets blocked in your

day yeah it was too many of them by

yourself it's interesting it's great

yeah so that's what it'll become holding

up phones but it's all because I went to

Stonehenge yeah so it's a it's also a

observatory so this was it you that

named this yeah yeah damn check you out

coins coins I think say coined it yeah

Manhattan hinge because the buildings

are like hinges the hinge is a stone is

a vertical stone there's a vertical

structure if you made a stone it's a

stone hinge why isn't it possible to

construct a calendar that doesn't have

leap years what you would have to do you

could do it but what would happen is it

means you care more about the year than

you do about the day so what would

happen is you would celebrate the New

Year at like 3:00 in the afternoon

right and then the next year you've

celebrated at like 12 minutes after 3:00

in the afternoon and then 20 minutes you

would you would it would sort of move

through your calendar and then that

means you cared more about the year the

Atari you care more about the til I say

that right you we always want to

celebrate New Year's on midnight of the

and by the way New Year's is celebrated

in 24 time zones not all at the same

time right

so it's interesting everyone thinks of

that as a moment hmm yeah it's really a

calendar event I'm sorry it's a [ __ ]

event it's celebrated over 24 hours yeah

if you're in Thailand it's 14 hours

different so therefore if you were to do

it astrophysically you would know the

exact moment where we returned in our

orbit and everybody would celebrate that

instant mmm and that would be so then

the whole world would celebrate the New

Year at the same time that it means you

value it differently it's not a midnight

celebration it's a you could do that I

know less Jill so it's a celestial

yeah huh so that would be the only way

yeah that's the only way because a day

doesn't cut evenly into the year that

those two have nothing to do with one

another

there's no reason why that would have so

we we we so in other words let me say it

another way just because you're looking

like you're like you're looking off in

space here so there's New Year's okay

let's count 365 days when we do that we

are not at the same place we were when

we last celebrated New Year's Day New

Year's Eve okay we're not the same place

in orbit a revolution around you rotate

on an axis you revolve around something

else as those two words okay how you use

those two words so we're not in the same

place but we celebrate New Year's anyway

well when will we be in the same place a

quarter of a day later six hours so we

would celebrate the next New Year at 6

a.m.

nobody's won those will end in the next

New Year at noon then the next year at 6

p.m. and then the next New Year kind of

aligns back again well that's the leap

day

the fourth year were you put in a later

Oh see so it's our love of the day yes

that keeps us yeah

[ __ ] up with the world and it comes to

the year yeah wow you pick one and then

that's how that's how you do it and what

the minds base it on the moon right I

didn't I didn't study their calendar as

deeply as I should have and wanted to

especially back in 2012 and everyone

said oh the Mayan calendar runs out so

therefore it's the end of the world I

was thinking because the Mayans said sir

the Maya sets out like that was back

when you know before that had happened

it was you know George Bush was

president in like 2007 and everybody was

thinking Jesus this is this is gonna be

the end oh they're so what so every

decade there's somebody predicting the

end of the world sure I'm actually quite

entertained by this exercise do you

member when they had billboards all

around okay just what years know that

that's a different end of the world

that's that's a guy with a radio podcast

Church then yeah and then the underworld

didn't come and so you pushed it forward

so that's it's entertaining we live in a

free country it's evidence that we live

in a free country where freedom of

speech is protected and you can practice

any religion you want right that's and

they didn't learn much science in school

that's a part of it that's part of the

fact that you have this in our world

I don't mind it actually I find it

entertaining but it becomes an issue if

people such as that gain power over

legislation over the rest of us because

this would counts this as a personal

belief it's your personal belief the

world is gonna end on October 19th in

the that's your present you you're in

fine right you but if you now create

laws that require I go with that you

just impose your personal belief on me

and your personal belief is not true for

everyone it's only true for you yeah

that's a problem and an objective truth

is true for everyone so if you're gonna

have if you're gonna have governance

you're gonna want to base governance on

what is objectively true

because it would apply to everyone

independent of your belief system hmm

yeah I agree with that and by the way

there there there there there are things

that we're not sure or true yet that

we're still researching that's not what

I'm talking about as an as an objective

truth check your truth have been

verified by multiple scientific studies

not just one study this was the problem

with the the cholesterol study there's a

cholesterol study that said everybody on

the course to drop their cholesterol

levels okay

saying it would be good for your heart

and all the rest of this because a

series of countries were studied where

they have longevity and low heart low

heart disease and low cholesterol intake

that study happened to leave out France

that happened and it just wasn't in the

study and a couple of other places that

have high cholesterol intake but don't

have higher heart disease so that study

was flawed but it was hard to replicate

it because it went over many years and

it was thousands of people and so

everyone just jumped on it you don't

have a scientific truth and this this is

a general problem with medical results

because the press is waiting at the at

the at the journal editors office oh

here's a new study that shows that this

gives you cancer oh that must be true

and out comes the headline because you

want to be the first to report it mm and

then that gets emblazoned in people's

heads and not everyone reads the

follow-up no one could duplicate that

study know what so there's a flaw we

don't even know what the flaw is we know

that no one else could get those results

so it goes in the dustbin of scientific

research most research in any Journal of

the moment will ultimately shown to be

wrong

that's the bleeding edge of science it's

a it's a great place to be because

you're in the you're in the trenches and

you don't know what is true you can't

look up in the back of the book what the

answer is to double-check you don't even

know what the question is to ask half

the time Oh

but it's very frustrating for people

that don't get it and correctly but it's

excited it's exciting for the science

it's exciting to acknowledge ya period

it's constantly expanding and growing

but it's very frustrating for people

that really don't have the time and you

know maybe did get some outdated

nutrition knowledge what they need an

answer no they didn't answer right Yeah

right now and and religion in many ways

gives you answers right now yeah without

the need to sort of research it or to go

on the frontier the lack of education

and the lack of the lack of curiosity

about is one of the scariest things

about new generations of kids right like

when the new generations are coming up

if they know less than the generation

before that's when we really start to

freak out that would be a problem

although I have good confidence in the

30 and under is that millennial I how

will you have to be I think Millennials

have only ever known the internet and

devices so recent but my son is a

millennial and he's like my kids are

Millennials so they're 20 ish so not 30s

a little old so 25 and under I think are

the Millennials

yeah but 30 when they were 10 the

internet was around I know but they need

a different marketing term so you can

market to them differently

yeah so to me I would put them in the

same bin just as you were thinking there

but but they they have a different

relationship to Science and Technology

of course they're not they don't fear

the science or the technology they

embrace it because it has shaped the

civilization that has enabled their

social life it has but through this like

one of the things that I tweeted I think

it was from Scientific American

yesterday maybe was yesterday that it's

a little bit misleading but one of the

things they said is only 64 percent of

Millennials have a strong belief these

things these coasters are terrible they

look great but then things stick to the

but how was it made of metal okay a

metal coaster yeah see the hell is that

sticks yeah that's the issue sticks when

it gets moisture you know about this we

flip this over and you tip it over and

then it whatever done that you know what

yes yeah oh because the pressure you

have the air pressure

okay but don't do it okay

subjective truth 64% of what of

Millennials are not our only 64% are

convinced the world is a ball the world

is a circle that lures us what is this

fear oyd so what it's called oblique I

mean I'd like to see how that question

exactly because if they know that we are

oblate and the thing is asking is earth

a ball they'll say no we're in a blatant

ball I'm slightly wider below the

equator than at the equator so we're a

pear-shaped oblate spheroid but it's not

a pair that you would find normally if

you found that period but this if I

compare the shape like a ball so the

these distinction these differences and

measurements are so small that if you

found it on the ground you would say

this is a perfect sphere right let me

tell you how this how good a sphere it

is right all right you ever see the the

schoolroom globes the the Geographic

globes and you rub your finger over

Nepal and you get the mmm the Himalayas

yeah and you get the Rockies and so that

is a gross exaggeration of reality yes

do you realize if you took earth with

all of its mountains valleys and hills

and met and shrunk it down to the size

of a cue ball it would be smoother than

any cue ball every machined yes yes

think about it what think about this Joe

really generous Joe Chill listen to me

right okay uh do you know the deepest

part of Earth's crust no the Marianas

Trench off the coast of the Philippines

in the Pacific Ocean that's the deepest

part deepest part goes six miles down

okay okay so okay without doing thinking

of the depth

sorry crust exact oh no no just access

to the deepest part of risk crust the

lowest point on earth surface the

Marianas Trench right off the coast of

the Philippines the highest point on

earth surface the tip of k1 k2

okay 132 this is Japan

I think it's k1 what why would you name

the tallest peak k2 it's a good point

I'm

all right I'm not a mountain climber but

I'm I'm just thinking where's k1 okay

with it's the Himalayan mountains okay

in Nepal okay isn't it in Nepal I think

it is yeah yeah okay so now let's say

how high up is that was 28,000 feet so

it's like five miles up okay right the

distance between the lowest point on

earth surface and the highest point on

earth surface is 11 miles that's here to

the Comedy Store that is less than the

length of Manhattan Oh

yet we are 8,000 miles in diameter and

those two points are very far separated

from one another if you are cosmic giant

and you came up to earth and you rubbed

your finger over Earth's surface it

would feel as smooth as a cue ball to

you Wow in fact in this in this book I

have a whole chapter called on being

round which is all about this it's all

about our perception of what is round

and what is not I had asked you to

debate want them Flat Earth guys no I

don't I can't I'd no no we talked about

it and we're gonna have a month I know

what we do is and I think this is a

diabolical plot so that the next time we

can ship people on mass into orbit they

all want to be the first in line because

they know we're gonna send them so if

they can see the round earth they're

gonna be the first ones in space just so

they can stop annoying the rest I do

have people that have met that don't

believe because they the problem with

YouTube videos is it's a problem with a

lot of things but one of the things

about being unchecked while you're

discussing things is you can say things

you can use big words you can sound

articulate and smooth and you can do it

in a very professional-looking manner or

do it passionately yes passionately

convincingly charismatic ly and you

you're unchecked but if you did that in

front of an expert and you showed them

that along the way they go stop that's

not true stop that's not what works

right let me show you why this is

incorrect let me show you how you can

prove the

this is incorrect show your objective

truths but this is not happy to render

your argument invalid so people don't

have any education and then they watch

one of these YouTube clips they start

actually believing that this stuff makes

sense because it's unchecked and I would

say it's not about whether they've had

education it's about whether the

education they had teaches them

skepticism of information and teaches

them how to inquire you realize it's

just as intellectually lazy to believe

everything you see as it is to deny

everything you see yes why should

someone know automatically that earth

isn't flat yet I tell them in the next

breath that the entire universe was once

as small as a marble right both of those

sound cool a preposterous except one has

evidence to back it and the other does

not

and very strong scientific theoretical

and experimental underpinnings so when

you are trained to inquire you don't

either believe everything outright or

reject everything outright you're

trained to ask questions you're trained

to probe deeper than the layer of

information that comes to you that's

what should be taught in school and it's

not they give you a book and say learn

this yeah and you'll get tested on it

and then when you're done learn this

well listen also there's a problem with

being in X or oblique connected to your

first belief do you when you have an

idea and it's in your head it's very

difficult for people to shake that ID

and they start arguing that idea that

idea becomes a part of their identity

and they dig their heels in deeper an

opposing view is presented because they

connect themselves to these ideas right

it's it is who they are right right and

so I I try not to base my character

profile on something that is not yet

verified as objective truth and that's a

very good thing to do it's one of the

reasons why I don't have tattoos on my

body but stretch in my face go on one of

the reasons is there's nothing I am so

sure about

that I want to put it indelibly on my

skin well no no that's not let me say

differently there's nothing I value in

my mind body and soul so much in this

moment that I want to indelibly etched

it on my skin because I want to leave

room for me to have a possibly more

enlightening thought later mmm that

would override whatever was my decision

in that moment and since I count myself

among the lifelong learners I'm learning

stuff all the time they say wow that's

good I didn't know that well that's even

better what's something you learned

recently so you went oh okay let me let

me think hmm okay or something I learned

recently I think I knew this when I was

a kid but if you're playing basketball

and you're shooting okay and you say oh

that didn't go in oh my gosh well you

know the rim they should maybe make the

rim a little bigger IQ score more often

do you realize two basketballs can fit

exactly side by side through the opening

of a basketball hoop hmm really

yes I guess that makes sense two

basketballs top squeeze no it's not a

cosmically mind-blowing moment but that

gives you perspective next time you

watch a basketball game

it's how these guys can fly from the

from the foul line in a in an airborne

slam dunk and not miss because the area

of this opening is four times you do the

math it's four times as large as the

ball itself right because of the

different positions it could be so

they're multiple positions and they can

still do it

so it's not that that's easy to

accomplish but knowing this you realize

how much easier it is to score than you

might have otherwise thought I wonder if

basketball so that was a recent that was

a recent revelation that's a good

revelation yeah I wonder if basketball

players occasionally practice with a

smaller hole I think about this all the

time I said if I was a basketball player

you don't want to practice with

everyone saying yes because that venue

would that would throw the water off

your enjoy your practice with this and a

bigger ball they use a bigger ball we

use a ball sometimes it's almost as big

as their wait a minute is it heavier no

no no no you don't know you don't use a

bigger bowl it's a thing they did a long

time ago I bet they still don't they no

longer do it because then your grip is

different the grip has matters right

where your two hands go and what they

feel yeah so you want to do it you use a

smaller rim and in baseball you throw a

faster pitch to give you less reaction

time there a skinnier bat the pool table

is a very small pocket opening nice four

inch pocket opening is opposed to a five

and a half inch so it's quite a bit if

you're doing it you're doing it and so I

would also you know growing up I played

stickball in the street in New York and

so you're using basically a broom handle

and so when the first time you play

baseball officially it's like whoa yeah

I've got this huge bat and so stickball

players tend to transfer very well to

baseball when you're a kid yeah because

your instrument is bigger it is your a

the talent code no Daniel Coyle know one

of the interesting parts about it is

Brazilian soccer players how good they

are and they he attributed to a

different game that they play with a

heavier ball that they do indoors it's a

small heavy ball and because they do it

in tight quarters it involves incredibly

fast footwork okay and movement and then

these guys take that footwork and

movement and it translates amazingly

well to an open soccer field I wonder if

they calculated that because what you

would do is let's say the ball weighs

twice as much then it would only go half

as far when you kicked it so then you

make a field half as large I don't think

they did then you can reproduce almost

all of the dynamics of the soccer game I

think it was based on just trying to

play games like how far you can rub it

in over if it's balls twice as heavy you

throw it half as far the field is half

the size right and then you have a mini

game they survive right that makes sense

there's a whole fun exercise you can do

playing sports on other planets with

different ground it's a very very fun

thing to do if you're a dork

you know it's funny occasionally I'll

tweet something and people say dork and

I say yeah thanks for the compliment

okay it's already a bath it used to be a

dork as well

you give wedgies to the Nerds yeah well

the Nerds would also be the people that

were like but now a nerd is like you can

be a science nerd and people like it

that's a go yeah yeah I'm an old movie

nerd you can say that yeah or movie geek

yeah taking dork okay taking dork and

nerd yeah take that I tell you I must I

must have told you this last time I was

on your show when I was a kid I was

bigger than other kids I was always one

of the tallest two kids in the class out

of 30 so I was bigger than others in the

day and I was also physically fit and

physically active athletic but I was

squarely in the geek camp okay I had my

slide rule back in the day walking down

the corridor you know you were also

wrestling I was captain in my high

school's wrestling team so I was a geek

person who could actually kick your ass

okay and I saw how my fellow geeks cuz

that's the community that I so seen

card-carrying were treated by the

football quarterback and the popular

kids and the kids who are all beautiful

and the ones who and I imagine my future

as a superhero defender of the geek so

that you put up a little you know bat

signal whatever geeks they don't put a

few digits of pi and I come flying in

and there's a wedgie in progress right I

would just land and I grabbed the the

bully and and ripped them off the the

encounter and I've just saved the day

this is my superheroes always the

football players right always it's all

because there's I think they're rewarded

for violence for violence they also have

brain damage weekly as we've come to

discover how [ __ ] up is that you find

out high school kids right literally

across the board the majority of people

who play football have CTE right

in as far down as seventh-grade yeah

what yes et remind me that's Texas for

um chronic traumatic encephalopathy

[Music]

encephalopathy dot yeah say like Mike

Tyson alpha P so let me tell you that

story about Christopher Columbus please

so the dick story told you the dick

story yeah now let me tell you just

something else okay okay I think him

coming to America was the most

significant thing to ever happen in our

species whoa silence not an internet

porn no that's just porn in another

medium right Wow yeah so yeah internet

porn is just a matter of degree not a

matter of yes does it exist or does it

not right okay I think it was a most

significant event to happen in our

species kind of amazing when you stop

and think about the fact that at that

point in time other than the Native

Americans who lived here who living a

nomadic tribal existence very few people

that had the wheel that had firearms

that had all these things that had

already been achieved in the rest of the

world had made their way to this place

so don't watch okay here's how it worked

right so you're gonna hear so I that you

have some skepticism of this claim as

most people would especially the the

Columbus haters who are out there all

right now I don't really have any okay

so let me let me describe to you why I

think this is true okay and then you can

tell me whether you agree or not all

right we are hunter-gatherers we haven't

settled down yet the early humans and

we're basically wandering we're

following the herds alright and then the

ice age hits well what is an ice age an

ice age means it is so cold that when

the moisture evaporates from the

goes to the clouds the clouds go over

the land it doesn't rain it snows and

the snow falls and then it stays so the

water that had lifted up from the ocean

does not return to the ocean it

accumulates on the land and this

accumulation when it's significant and

sustained we call glaciers glaciers is

not itself a snowfall it is compressed

snow that's basically change state into

this this ice river that flows very

slowly back to the ocean but the oceans

are getting drained faster than they're

getting replenished so during the Ice

Age the ocean levels dropped exposing

the Bering Strait land bridge between

Asia and what is now Alaska basically

North America the our ancestors who come

out of Africa go into Europe some stayed

others kept wandering some stayed low

above the Mediterranean others went high

they populate Asia they keep walking

because there's a land bridge there they

don't even know it's a bridge it's just

more land so they walk and they enter

North America from there that's kind of

only way you can go with South at that

point the weather gets a little better

the Ice Age ends the glaciers melt back

into the oceans the oceans level ocean

levels rise closing the land bridge

stranding a branch of the human species

for 10,000 years those humans who made

it across that land bridge and spread

out into North America Central America

South America have only a few families

as their parent genetic as their genetic

origin okay oh it's like that some

research says it's like eight family

lineages populated the entire north of

South American

countenance then the land bridge breaks

now you have Europe Asia Africa and

North and South America and they know

nothing of one another two separate

branches of the human species

the Vikings notwithstanding maybe they

found came over they didn't time that

even if they did their influence was

near zero relative to the Europeans so

we're talking about influence here this

is a branch had this continued this is

how you specie ate this is why the

species on Australia that's why you have

mammals there would they have pouches

all right no other mammals do that they

split off and they evolved their own way

okay so ten thousand years is not enough

to grow three heads or you know twelve

fingers but our species is separate now

Columbus crosses the Atlantic makes

contact with humans this is the first

time that has happened in ten thousand

years we have rejoined two branches of

the human species we are now one common

genetic group and that genetic

crossbreeding and that continues to this

day we fly to any corner of the world

and mates okay and the mating already

began immediately yes there were

diseases that Columbus brought to North

America much written about that less

written is that he brought syphilis back

to Europe first cases of syphilis of

1492 whoa and then it yes what did they

have no problem with it well yeah I

don't know the details of how the

physiology of the natives huh

dealt with that or whether it mutated

you know I don't and there may people

know that I'm not among them that's fast

but if just look at you look at the

graph of syphilis reported syphilis

cases in Europe it all began 1492 when

he came back so what I'm saying is this

was a hugely significant event the

rejoining of the branches of the human

species but ya know I would imagine that

that makes sense that is the most

important

and by the way Native Americans you know

this famous infamous problem with

metabolizing alcohol okay with Native

Americans you know where else has their

problems the Chinese they do yes yes yes

so it's an Asian issue well so who

stayed in it so you look at who

populated North and South America after

the you know before the landbridge is

whoever was right at the edge of Asia

right then the land bridge is so-so

Asians and and North American and and

the natives of North and South America

have more in common with each other

because of this then most other pairs of

groups you might grab around the world

but my point is obviously we there's a

lot to blame Columbus for but he just

happened to be the guy who did it first

Europe was coming to the new world no

matter what that everybody was trying to

find a faster trade route to the Indies

and so if what if it wasn't Columbus it

would have been Arnold's Mednick or

whatever it doesn't matter

somebody did that and the rest is as

they say history Wow

so personally I think it's the most

significant thing to happen in our

species otherwise we'd still be two

stranded branches of humans it would be

fascinating though like Australia

stranded to see what would happen if it

this has gone on for hundreds of

thousands of years hundred thousand that

would have been a different story right

yeah and your immunities would be

different your yeah well that's the big

concern about aliens right one of the

big concerns is that there's some sort

of a virus you pick up from somewhere I

think that's harder to accept so for

example what are the chances that a oak

tree would catch whooping cough not so

good we're two different species so

viruses tend to be very species targeted

yeah but what about species sure they

can jump species but so there's a jump

mammal to mammal does it vertebrate to

vertebrate but so yes that can happen

but the more different the life-form is

it is sensible to suppose that the less

likely

you're gonna share the same diseases

that's all but NASA regardless has

safeguards in place in the event that

that happens so it's it's called the

planetary protection program the NASA

it's got as a whole division of masks

it's protecting Earth from bugs that

could be coming from space on our own

spaceship that we bring back and it

protects destinations from us there's a

certain sterilization levels that we

invoke the Cassini spacecraft we plunge

that back into Saturn in its death when

we were done with it and ran out of

money we're done with it plunged into

Saturn to vaporize we didn't leave in an

orbit around Saturn why because it might

have crashed into one of Saturn's moons

that might have life and if someone had

sneezed on the spacecraft before it got

launched we don't want to contaminate

the life that we were later gonna one

day want to study so that's what so we

plunged it into Saturn that's why that

is why because they were worried about

let maybe in hitting Europa once it's

dead and you can't track it or guide it

anymore then it's a it's a while it's a

wild card it might hit your Europa is a

moon of Jupiter but yeah Enceladus there

are other moons that have sort of ocean

water their water world's basically and

so the concern is that we would

introduce life suppose we did it crashed

and then we go back later and find life

and it has DNA just like here but was it

our life that we contaminated with that

you don't want to confuse the future

science of it so that's a that's the

plan

can you even watch a science movie like

science fiction movies I know you had a

real problem with gravity boom yeah

alright so I let me set the record

straight here okay I mean let me just go

on record okay okay I've been deeply

misunderstood with my comments on movies

deeply misunderstood deeply deeply and

so I've just stopped most last time you

saw a movie comment in my Twitter stream

we haven't you haven't I've kind of just

stopped wasn't the Matthew McConaughey

movie did you comment on that one oh

interstellar just oh that's the last one

I commented on

a big way right you've done yeah I'm

done because people then thought I've

just being nitpicky I did one it's not

fun going in movies with you yeah why

would you do that Tyson will just say

that can never happen and so so my

intent was my intent did not match how

people received my intent my intent is

here's an observation that I think if

you understood this it would enhance

your appreciation of the movie let me

give an example please do Star Wars The

Force awakens they've got one was that

that's the one with that introduced a

bb-8 okay that's the most recent no no

no this is like four movies ago now plus

I've lost track because there's another

one okay so the one to introduce bb-8

cutest cute as ever

okay our cute little fella and in there

they have their like the the updated

Death Star right okay remember the old

Death Star has enough power to destroy a

planet and that's devastating this one

it can suck energy out of a star so that

the star no longer exists

hmm then it could take these energy

beams and kill six planets at once it's

no longer just a one planet killer six

or eight whatever the number was it was

like high single digits okay well I did

the math on this and I tweeted and I I

said first okay they did take all the

energy from a star you become a star but

let's not maybe they've got a

containment mechanism I'll give it to

them it is the future after all honey is

the future but what a long time ago in a

galaxy far yeah that's another another

another universe of civilizations

okay mass but they have Lightspeed and

we don't so it's the future of our

technology even if it's the past of our

time so so you do the calculation and I

forgot the number but I got I calculated

how much energy is stored in a star

that's enough energy to explode a

thousand planets oh my gosh they under

represented the energy that it sucked

out of the Xhosa tar out of the snow

hmm and I thought this could have been

more badass than even they came up with

in this movie that is the nature of my

comments mmm not what could this happen

could it not happen let me give you a

perspective okay well so so 20% of

people just get pissed off 80% really

liked it and they want more but that 20%

they they cut me no slack and I'm only

doing this for people to enjoy and if if

I have that level of hate mail I don't

need to continue it I'm sorry to

basically stop I just thought to myself

but I don't have the urge to share them

I still have the thoughts I gotta teach

you the art of post and drop okay this

is what you do you post something know

people gonna get mad you drop your phone

and you walk away do that man can't be

reading those [ __ ] comments not it's

dealing with too many human being no I

got that I get that but but you don't

because you're still changing your

behavior here's my morons here's my

rebuttal your rebuttal my rebuttal is if

you're watching a movie that takes place

in 1958 it's a period piece and there's

a car from 1960 oh yeah and I'll be

crazy and someone who's a car expert

points that out you say hey he's an

expert that's pretty good

do you complain that the person noticed

that no you praise their expertise I get

mad at the movie if you get mad at the

movie if you're watching a Jane Austen

period piece and as 1870 whenever they

took place and someone gets out of the

carriage with tie-dyed bell-bottoms you

would cry foul right that would take you

up I'm exaggerating there obviously

could be a top hat instead of a derby

you would cry foul if you were a costume

designer and we would all be impressed

by that level of knowledge that you

exhibited mmm-hmm I am bringing a level

of science to bear on a movie that is no

different from anybody else's expertise

who is out there that we have praised

for that invocation yet people are not

granting me that latitude to make those

comments I don't like these

generalizations I don't like this is

true

but I don't like your saying people are

not doing this now a small vocal

minority that are [ __ ] and those are

the people that you're altering your

behavior for that's what I think is

ridiculous about them no because my

people would enjoy it when are you

talking about gravity and the fact that

hair wouldn't do that and the space

stations weren't that close together

right right you'll see it in the sky

right right but but it's [ __ ]

no I my tweets or offerings not but I'm

not that's the problem the only problem

is you're reading responses no you're

doing is wonderful

no one's getting people 20% freak out is

high for that [ __ ] is 20 listen hey I

don't believe those numbers here man I'm

alright when it's 5% then I take notice

but you say 20% like what are you doing

calculations you actually do know I scan

a hundred of them I see 20 of them

that's just run into 20 [ __ ] so 20

[ __ ] out of the millions and

millions of people that father you have

decided to reach out and and you're

altering your behavior for [ __ ]

I like those quotes I like when you when

you when you break things down because I

didn't know those things and I like

thinking about like the hair and gravity

I was like oh yeah the [ __ ] [ __ ] be

standing straight up and the only reason

why I mentioned about here cuz every

photo of anybody with long hair when

happened to you but it was long here in

space it's standing up on edge it's it's

a completely obvious thing that was

omitted from the filming of gravity yeah

but you have to have hair and makeup

they have to have a reason to exist so

so what I might do I might take a poll I

might put it by my puzzles I'm a servant

I don't wanna force feed curiosity have

to listen on your feed anybody force

feeding anything you pretty offerings

out there like you said there's not

force feeding you're not knocking on

someone's home wake up [ __ ] read my

[ __ ] that is true I'm not forcing myself

on your property put the shotgun down

you're gonna hear me talk about your

movie listen man I said about bb-8 I

said first I said BBS way cuter than

r2d2 and I use like five A's in the way

just to just to start a fight because

that's a fun fight right then I said by

the way

artoo bb-8 a smooth metal rolling

spherical ball would have skidded

uncontrollably on sand in the whole

movie is moving around on sand right

yeah it would that's why you deflate

your top that's why you deflate your

tires to drive on Sam

that's correct Wow have you ever tried

riding a bicycle on sand it's impossible

to get pong I'd imagine that and that's

with rubber tires imagine steel tires

you're not running on sand dune holy oh

my gosh oh yeah well the hardest things

you do for talked about getting into

shape yeah so it will work if you have a

hard surface just below it a dusting of

sand right then you course yeah then you

can dig into it I've ended some

resistance and then connects to the hard

surface so I posted this and people say

you're ruining the movie for me you're

and then people start [ __ ] again

when you say people you're just

listening to [ __ ] smart people gonna

read that go oh yeah yeah this is stupid

it would roll around yeah I'm [ __ ]

things you track but red you know it

actually happened as a result I think

I'm getting phone calls from producers

oh there's a little bit of science we

want to make sure that you don't tweet

about so good you keeping them on point

as you know I might be most famous among

in movie commenting for the final scene

in Titanic okay now if you knew about

this what would you say about the we

know where the Titanic sank the

longitude the latitude yes we know what

time of day Oh to Mars so at the POV the

point of view of rose as she's looking

up deliriously to the sky there's only

one sky she should have seen and was the

wrong sky not only the left side of the

sky it was worse than it was worse than

that the left side of this guy was a

mirror reflection of the right side of

the scale did you call James it was lazy

because I call it didn't know repledge

back in 1996 I saw it when it first came

out I noticed instantly and because I

know the sky I this is what I yeah okay

so no reply five years later I bump into

him at a meeting nasa hosted a meeting

with some explorers and some scientists

i

brought it up to him and he says well at

the time I was not overseeing

post-production and that's when we added

that so I immaturely wanted to grovel at

my feet for forgiveness did you yeah I

wanted him to but that's not what

happened

so then five years after that I brought

it up again when I bumped into him and

then he said you know last I checked

Titanic Titanic has earned more than a

billion dollars worldwide imagine how

much more it would have earned if I'd

gotten this guy correct

that's a stupid answer from an [ __ ]

it was it should be tweeting you know so

so let's but that's an ego answer but

it's not the end of the story so so that

was okay I have nothing more I can say

here cuz he's right okay

no he's not he's right no it made it a

lot of money and it would have made the

same amount of money that's true but

that's not the point but he [ __ ] up

[ __ ] don't say how much money a week

later I got a phone call so hi I forgot

his name John Smith hi John how can I

help you is this the dr. Titus I said

yes he said I work post production for

James Cameron mm-hmm he's producing a

director's cut where he's adding new

footage and he tells me you have a sky

he could use yes

oh so the Centennial release of Titanic

released in April 2012 I mean oh yeah

that's right yes so there was a 2012 I

feel like you and I had this

conversation I think we might have we

laughs I just put this in context yeah

it's got so so he actually put in so he

did come through my so here's what

happened Seth MacFarlane calls me up and

said I'm making a movie about a talking

teddy bear and I need to know the sky

over a town outside of Boston in 1985 on

Christmas Eve looking north northeast

you got a sky I said I get back to you

half hour later I send him the sky that

was the sky that the kid wished on to

for Ted

came to life so Ted had the correct

Scott and Titanic did not so first on

first correcting these at Ted one

Titanic zero on that right so the point

is that people started thinking about it

and if the highest compliment I ever got

was Andy weir who wrote the Martian he

said to himself while he was writing the

novel he said because he's an engineer

so he has the fluency and he's also

knows how to write

he's right creatively he said if Tyson

were looking over my shoulder well would

he would he tweet about this or not and

so that put him on notice to make sure

that his calculations were accurate and

the Martian is one of the most

entertaining ly accurate explorations of

how to invoke science to not die that

there ever was so for me that was a very

high compliment and it was kind of worth

it all of the naysayers that to know

that that Andy weir came through on that

yeah so why stop well maybe maybe I'll

change I think you need to learn how to

post and drop just think about it like

this posted boom walk away walk away

just go do something else man you don't

need to look at that [ __ ] you don't need

to look at what people are gonna say

make sure that there's no typos that's

always like no yeah it is isn't it

amazing yeah I got a fat thumbs me too I

I care though I'm sure you do about what

how people can think about what I wrote

mm-hmm if it's a way that I had not

considered okay I like knowing it makes

me a better communicator when I'm in

front of an audience I'll know what

percent will think one way versus

another and I can modify what I'm saying

to be more precise and - as we say in

physics to reduce the impedance between

the signal and the receiver so that

there's a better match between the

communicator and the audience I

understand that but if you you surely

have told jokes that people just took

the wrong way oh yeah the right way they

just didn't like what I was so yeah yeah

but it's surely like you see the word

cuck in a response you know

versus an [ __ ] right there's certain

things you just see like your cook like

okay enough listening anymore now I know

what you are yeah right you see that

like you you spend all the time stare

the [ __ ] sky instead of filling the

blank those are just [ __ ] well I

have pretty thick skin so it's not that

it upsets me it's that I'm here to serve

you not to piss you off are you not

there to serve I'm an educator there's

some people I'm an educator they're

looking to get angry maybe I can bring

them around

you can't the arrogance of thinking that

you could fix thirty plus years of

worthless [ __ ] living with a couple

of tweets okay you know something I

don't even want to take you up on that

challenge cuz you're probably right I'm

telling you you got a lot you gotta walk

away but for most people myself included

in those most people I enjoy those

tweets so I don't want something here's

one so I tweeted something and somebody

responding to somebody else's tweet said

you know I don't really like Tyson he's

such he's so pompous mmm okay so so I

tweeted back to that person and I said

thanks for your note could you please

share with me the single most pompous

thing you've ever seen me do and he

wrote back you said damn you would have

to be reading my tweets what you now you

put me on the spot I can't think of

anything right now but overall I really

like your work I think put nothing

forward yeah that happens all the time

because people are just shocked that you

respond but plus there's people can get

into a stereotype mode where there's

though that person is that and therefore

everything then just decide that's the

legacy that I write right you can't

listen those people do smart for this

and other people said look the dude

wrote a book called Astrophysical people

in a hurry yeah you'd say how pompous is

that that's not right hello write your

science educator I interviewed on

Startalk yes you were one of my guests

but so too was Katy Perry

now you go there people get pissed off

cuz they they just cuz she's a nothin

add she's just pop cause I said she

wanted she wrote a song about boney and

alien and I wanted to find out what she

was thinking yes yes her song she is a

line about it which I'm making love to

it so there's always ways you can you

[ __ ] Russell Crowe a few times or what's

named Peters sorry Russell I don't get

brand Peters wrestle Pete is a good

friend of Mines like Joe what the [ __ ] I

don't I just come back from Italy oh

yeah very confused yeah my brains zoning

a little out of it out of it try to keep

you awake for your friend Russell no

sorry she [ __ ] Russell Brand say it I

didn't know I didn't think I didn't know

any of this

you're married I didn't know this so

he's like an alien is my point he's a

very odd duck oh I see yeah he's a he's

a brilliant guy but he's he's out there

and he'd be like one of those guys that

would be in men in black aliens that

they're tracking to remember that scene

in the headquarters there's a big right

we're going to cover alien yeah all

aliens yeah they're like Michael Jackson

was there people who just there's

something a little different about them

you know so there's people that really

do believe that that believe that

there's aliens amongst us again that we

learn a free country I'm fine

but well you know what happens evidence

at some point should matter but you find

out about like Russian agents that have

been living in like New Jersey for like

thirty years that's the whole premise of

the Americans Americans yeah well it's a

real story to me really has happened on

multiple occasions and so they wonder

well if the Russians willing to do that

what are the aliens want to do yeah so

just find me one yeah maybe there are

doing you open minded to that of course

oh my gosh know who doesn't want to meet

aliens II wish I would love to meet the

aliens they're gonna have technology

that we don't have o to compare notes I

wanna oh my gosh do you by the way in

the movie arrival with the which one

arthropod okay there's and there's two

arrivals well there's an earlier rival

with Charlie Sheen yeah that's a good

one too so this one is you know it's

like a septa Puss lands yes certain

freaky things would speak in ink okay so

we can ink right so ice so they sent a

physicist and an anthropologist not

anthropologist a a linguist and I

tweeted I said you know if aliens come I

would not send a physicist and a link

and a linguist I would send and a an

astrobiologist and a cryptographer man

but then the linguist got all upset and

they started piling piling on the

linguist PI yeah she's not a linguist

she was a what if it's ant if you're an

anthropological linguist ortho they all

are but you just look up the title what

her profession was but anyhow so so they

all piled up piled up that's that's fine

bollocks SAT because how many linguists

are ever shown in a film so this was

their time in the Sun it's a big moment

so I get it that's fine but they're a

couple of things so for example there it

is making these circles and they're

interpreting them but it's making them

on glass so how do they know we weren't

seeing them the mirror image of what he

was trying to communicate that that was

not addressed in the film but yeah I'd

want to meet the aliens as they did

there they brought the military of

course that it would be a likely fact

but because your protection is of

extreme importance but here this happens

in all sci-fi movies you go up to this

thing and you get lifted up against the

force of gravity at that point I would

just put down all my weapons because

stuff going on that's way beyond your

understanding of the laws of physics

yeah you know it's like pulling out your

pistol and shooting at the spacecraft

that crossed half the galaxy to to come

to you what are you doing yeah they are

clearly superior to you in ways that you

don't even know yet so just find another

way to do your talking rather than

sending bullets their way but isn't that

always the case in every film I mean

it's always part of the narrative is

that the the primitive people [ __ ] it up

for the advanced civilization that's

coming here too

buzzer yeah it's never been good for the

less technologically advanced

civilization ever ever ever yeah right

and going on right now currently and by

the way undiscovered tribes

not to sound pluggy but this one of the

profiles here is of Captain Cook ah just

a quick thing I've visited Hawaii only a

couple of times in my life one of the

times I saw Don Ho the show yes yeah oh

my gosh and he was like he only sat down

he was like big and heavy and old and he

died a couple of decades ago but hey

yeah Don Ho he just tells Hawaiian

stories and one of them was about

Captain Cook and heat that some want

someone asked about whatever happened to

Captain Cook you know how he replies he

says nobody's ever seen him he's making

things he's pickin Captain Cook of Lake

so his rumors are that he was eaten by

yeah Pacific island natives but that

happened to a lot of pirates so watch

what happens so the Brits and Captain

Cook to the South Pacific why well you

look at his marching orders it's oh

there's what's called a transit of Venus

that's going to take place visible only

from the South Pacific this is where

earth in our orbit and Venus it's in

orbit are such that when Venus passes

between us in the Sun it actually is

exactly between us in the Sun you can

watch it move this circle move across

the Sun surface and then look through a

device that device with it filters we're

fine okay so if you measure that you can

learn the exact scale of the solar

system so you learn deep scientific

knowledge about how far away the planets

are and how far away the Sun is from the

earth it was not known with precision

before that measurement was made so

Captain Cook goes on his voyage to do

this well it's a pretty expensive voyage

oh oh wait flip over the marching orders

Oh open the envelope while you're there

use these new navigation techniques that

use the Sun Moon and stars

and map every coastline you find and

bring that information back to us within

ten years of Captain Cook navigating the

South Pacific as well as the northern

coast of Australia and New Zealand

within ten years Britain took control

over those coastlines became part of the

British Empire hegemony at its finest on

the premise that he's observing

something about the universe but there

was a tandem role that he played I did

not know they knew that much about the

cycles of the planets that they could be

there they knew accurately they could be

part of the motivation part of the

motivation of knowing any of this was

navigation around the globe was

navigation how you gonna know where you

are on earth you can get your latitude

that's just the altitude the height of

Polaris the North Star above the horizon

and measure that at night you can wait

that long where do you know where you

are vert in longitude ships would would

be shipwrecked millions of dollars worth

of Commerce would be at the bottom of

the ocean because they didn't know where

coastline was and the only way you can

measure coastline is see if you have

good navigational tools and tactics

which involves a an accurate chronometer

a timekeeping device for your prick and

knowing what the Sun Moon and stars are

doing in your sky so the astronomer in

that day was crucial to the mapping of

the earth and whose mapping earth is it

just geologists for fun no it is nations

wielding power over regions beyond the

beyond their own coastlines and that's I

have a quote here that's where this

quote comes from I got a guy from

seventeen whenever I get here stood 1757

James Ferguson 1757 here's his quote of

all the sciences cultivated by mankind

astronomy is acknowledged to be and

undoubtedly is the most sublime the most

interesting and the most useful for by

knowledge derived from this science not

only the bulk of the earth is

discovered but our very faculties are

enlarged with the grandeur of the ideas

it conveys our minds exalted above their

low contracted prejudices oh I gotta

drop a mic on that here boom drop that

mic

so notice he lists mapping the earth

first then he talks about how it exalts

in our grandeur hmm so yeah it's an

exercise in dominance in hegemony in

power under the guise of studying well

it's not so much it's just they call

fate they did it together if they matter

to one another yeah I was part of it

it's part of it and they're using a

sextant for all this so sexton helped

there's an octant a little earlier the

people and the the Muslims used an

astrolabe okay you've got by the way

what's the number it's a third or two

but I forgot that the fraction around

1/2 of all stars that have names in the

night sky have Arabic names because in

the Golden Age of Islam a thousand years

ago navigation was a big deal and they

navigated using astrolabes which is sort

of the the the Islamic counterpart to

the sextant and the octant that were

used what is left of Europe a sphere

that relates a gorgeous Oh then they're

works of art their brass they're edged

there's righty I sell them you can buy

replicas but you know I can get original

see find astrolabe yeah yeah astrolabe

what that looks like oh yeah so there's

a there's a thing that hangs down there

are different discs that you can replace

depending on where you are on earth to

be to know where you are more accurately

so this is all navigation so that it was

almost like clips for a GPS device yes

they're gorgeous they're completely

gorgeous Wow what the [ __ ] you carry

them with found that somewhere you go

okay aliens a bit yeah yeah exactly if

you didn't otherwise you know you're

history look at this that's about the

size of a heavyweight champions Bell

buckle buckle bet so what is that thing

doing so yeah depends

where you are runners when you want

that's what I'm saying so this is we're

talking about this was you know a

thousand years ago say you know this is

seven hundred years ago six hundred

years ago five the Ottoman Empire is

spreading their influence and they've

got they've got astrolabes so this is

Islam did you don't even learn about

this in school could you only hear about

the rest of Europe Christian Europe so

this mask an incredible looking device

yes and these are dials that turn it

looks like underneath tattoo like

there's a rhyme or reason to it with all

the claws and everything it completely

looks like art it looks like some

bizarre looks like an alien yeah yeah so

again if you're only listening just just

google astral astrolabe and and then

look at any of them that's a primitive a

more primitive one was simpler one and

so that's 1602 so no so that one that

has the spirit of an astrolabe but I

don't know that if they would have

called that an astrolabe the others they

go way back and so the most decorated

ones are the ones from the Middle East

but anyhow the point is GPS is no

different from the navigation tools in

in concept from the navigation tools

that Captain Cook invoked for Britain to

then take control over all the South

Pacific that they did it is where are we

and do we know this information with

precision and so and what happens if an

anime force takes out our GPS and we

have so much dependent on it what are we

going to do

we've got people now worrying about

working on using navigation by pulsars

can't take those out because those are

cosmic they're sending highly time to

pulses that reach earth in different

places on the sky and by measuring them

you can and the time delay between one

and the other you can actually localize

yourself on Earth's surface with

extremely high precision and without any

use of satellites that's the future of

navigation where you were insulated from

a rogue nation that might want to take

out your satellites pulsars

pulsers and by the way the Trump space

force you know the many people whole lot

of Trump haters out there and but if you

want to hate Trump rationally you want

to not hate him no matter what he says

you want to evaluate statement by

statement what he says right that's what

you want to do he says I want a space

for us well let's think about that okay

in the Second World War there was the

Air Force except they were not their own

branch they were part of the army was

called the Army Air Force and then we

realized that command and control in the

air needs different kinds of soldiers

there because they have to be pilots

it's a different kind of decision making

different kinds of tactical actions you

would have in the in the theater of

operations and so it was sensible to

spawn off a new branch of the military

called the Air Force no one today would

question whether that was a good idea

today you should know that operations in

space in the vacuum of the universe is a

different regime that you're operating

in from moving through the air your

hardware looks different your your

strategies are different your decision

your command and control is different so

it's not a crate just because it came

out of trumps mouth doesn't make it a

crazy idea that you might want a space

force in fact I had proposed the space

force in 2001 when I was on a commission

appointed by George W Bush to explore

the future of the United States space

aerospace industry a commission of 12 so

I put it on the table we have Air Force

generals they're former members of

Congress people from Lockheed Martin and

people said well the Air Force is

currently overseeing space the United

States Space Command so everybody was

happy with it and so I find that's okay

let's not worry about it

if everybody's have but as if as long as

this needs of our presence and space

grows but more importantly the size of

our assets as long as that continues to

grow what else would a military do

beyond protecting your borders they

would protect your assets and our space

assets by day but day by day are growing

by leaps and bounds

so it's not acids meaning like satellite

satellite station and the value of those

it's not just the cost of the satellite

is the value that's at the satellite to

you right

the the military is now creating a whole

other GPS system that is will be

exclusive to them and then they're gonna

see the current GPS too and and what

have we done with GPS this hard-earned

engineering and physics and orbital

mechanics what have we done with the GPS

we now use it to find out who you want

to mate with Oh someone's in your area

yeah that's what this is tinder this is

Grindr this is show me may double people

within 20 square blocks of where I am

that's a GPS mate on Grindr I did look

at the definition mate mate implies

you're making a baby

yeah who you gonna have sex with fine

yeah yeah so so that has a certain

economic value to society in sodas uber

so do all the things that so does UPS

tracking their trucks yeah so it's not

the cost of the satellite it's the value

of the satellite to our economy you'd

want that protected make sense is there

a space force currently alig is it real

how they recruited the United States

Space Command so is there anybody who's

in general if we make a space there's

generals in the Air Force overseeing

Space Command so if you're gonna make a

space force you would offload you would

offload the space activities of the Air

Force Space Command to this US Space

Command primarily to the space force and

then add or subtract from that in

whatever way is sensible given the needs

if we have a space force you know what I

wanted to see what I want them to

protect us from asteroids how about that

for an offense program that makes sense

okay you want the government involved in

that shouldn't be someone a little bit

more thorough guess not how it works

it's not scientists yeah you you just

made you made a blanket anti-government

yeah Asian cuz you're just

anti-government guessing people say okay

so private enterprise is not good at

doing expensive things that have never

been done before right need government

money government government does it

first okay right then you learn where

the hostels are where the friendlies are

where

what patent did you need to make this

happen then the venture capitalists

meeting about whether I'm gonna make a

buck on it has some has some some teeth

in it they say how much will this cost

will we know because the government did

it and we think we can do it for half

that price is it dangerous yes the

government did this and they lost two

people but we will put protections in so

we won't have that risk what is the

return on the investment the government

got no return because they didn't that's

it wasn't the objective but here's how

we can bring so I'll do it second I

won't do it first this is how you get

the Dutch East India Trading Company

they were not the first Europeans to the

new world because where's the edge of

the earth will you find India where will

you get what you don't know any of this

I'm screaming at you sorry you don't

know any of this Columbus does it first

and he can tell you where there's food

and where this isn't where there isn't

and where they want to kill you and

where they don't then you hand that

information to the mark to the

mercantilist s-- and they make a buck

after the fact so they come in they come

in yeah that's how you do it that's how

modern airplanes came about people are

making planes in their garage the

government said this could be a cool

thing let's pay them and have them

compete to carry air mail new kind of

mail mail delivered by air oh that's

cool

so now I make an airplane cuz I want

that contract you say no you want the

contract you make an airplane that cat

has more cargo a bet better engine

you're cleverer now you just took the

contract from me now I make a bigger

airplane because I said oh I see what he

did there but now I can improve on that

now wait a minute I don't need to carry

mail I can carry people and thus is born

commercial yeah they're carefully the

government basically bankrolled it as

did as did prize money for accomplishing

certain achievements like Lindbergh no

one talks about the fact that there was

cash money available to him for having

done flown across the Atlantic solo

first cash money no kid yeah I did it

for the money yeah as most of them did

fly the longest the highest the fastest

each of these had money as

ciated with it so this drove the

marketplace it was not whether you could

make a product out of it initially

because you got to get over the early

humps you got to get through you got to

know what it is that works and what

doesn't so is there a plan with the

space force are they gonna make space

weapons and spaceships there's a treaty

in 1960s to which we are signatory

okay and I talked about in an accessory

to war it's again I hate I feel so bad

for doing this plug it baby no I feel so

let me hold it then no yeah you can you

hold it yeah yeah yeah I just feel but

it but it is the unspoken alliance

between astrophysics and the military

you look beautiful with that blank you

primarily because there is a bow and

arrow here other being shot by Senate

arias that became a weapon and a missile

at a tenure your bow and arrow guy yeah

last I checked yeah you've got a

freaking bow and arrow in the back room

here yes what are you afraid practice

when the zombies come run out of bullets

yeah I'm pulling this chick from Walking

Dead Oh seems to be the best weapon

everybody runs out of bullets right

zombies are slow and her weapon is in

fact this totally yeah so was I saying

before I interrupted myself space for

who's paying attention out there weapons

asteroid weaponizing space so this is

outer space trees but treaty for the

peaceful uses of outer space and it was

in 1967 there's some modification since

then but that's the basic one and we are

signature to it and so are the other

major countries of the world yeah didn't

we just break out of the Paris Accord

let's break out of that goddamn space

[ __ ] [ __ ] it's a beautiful document it

tries to be very forward-looking if

there's an astronaut from another

country who is at risk then you will go

to help them without question it's very

kumbaya okay so one of my sort of now

that I'm old and tired and I just I'm a

realist it's why should we promise to

not kill each other in space when we are

not

successful at doing that here on earth

and we don't even promise tonight

promise to do it here honor yeah

who are we to say oh well we'll kill

each other there but in space we'll all

hold hands maybe you know I don't have

that much confidence in human conduct

right I'm become cynical over my years

and I'm angry demonstrate to me that on

earth you'd know how to not kill one

another then I'll believe you're Space

Treaty so I'm saying here now

given that there is a treaty it says you

can't put heavy weapons in space as I

detail in one of the I'll by the way I

have a co-author on this I started doing

this twelve years ago and was like I

will never finish this for a thousand

years so I brought in a co-author office

Lang who is a longtime editor of my

essays that I written for Natural

History Magazine just give a shout out

to my co-author how does that work so

the in this case sort of takes your

stuff and stitches in this particular

case there's a lot of ways we

collaborated some of them I just

dictated entire chapters to her and but

leaving out certain details that would

require a nitty-gritty of sort of

research just to get the right numbers

in the right year and the right

commander and the right this but I know

broadly how it happened in what sequence

and so then she would take that in shape

that into a chapter other places I would

say you know this happened this happened

and that happened she would say well

that wouldn't fit the narrative as it's

coming together let's drop the middle

one and take the other two and I say

great so I'd write that up and she would

stitch it she would graft it is a better

word into the rest of what was going on

so this is even though there are places

here where I speak in first-person it's

actually it's a co-written project it's

not ghost written it's not I'm just

putting my name but somebody else wrote

I mean I write I know how to write so

we're co-authors on this but thanks for

asking

that was good so so the here's a problem

that we detail here people said I don't

want weapons in space okay there's

nothing more useless than a space weapon

relative to Earth's surface

okay if you're in space you're in orbit

take it through if I use your skull here

that's okay

okay if this is earth okay let's do

everything more spherical here I guess

not I'm using your skull so okay all

right so this is earth okay and I've got

a satellite in orbit around the earth

okay and I say okay I want to weaponize

the satellite put a bomb in it and I

want to drop over some city some some

bad person wants to make that decision

right well what's the city want it well

it's up here so I'm gonna drop it

halfway there so you got it well no it's

not just that these are not very high

above the planet and so you have to like

change the orbit to align it so that it

goes over your target satellites don't

go over every spot on earth right they

only go over the orbit that had print

preset for it okay we can already

destroy a city with an intercontinental

ballistic missile and we can aim that we

can aim a missile to any place on earth

and we'll get there

in less than 45 minutes and destroy the

whole city with nuclear weapons we can

already do that there is no advantage to

putting nukes in space if that's your

objective not only that suppose there's

a rogue satellite and it's messing with

you it's beaming energy particles at you

and you want to take it out how are you

gonna take it out you're gonna destroy

it oh now you break it into a million

pieces a thousand pieces

now each piece is moving 18,000 miles an

hour and put your own satellites at risk

that's the modern equivalent to in the

First World War when they said oh we

have a good idea because we can't shoot

them in the in the trenches let's gas

them out so they have the mustard gas

oops

the wind changed directions and all of a

sudden you become a victim of your own

weapon such as would happen in space if

you go in and start exploding satellites

out of orbit so war in space is a

different thing it's not what do you

think it would be so what would they do

so the outer peaceful use of outer space

treaty allows you to have defensive

things in space not offensive for

defensive purposes it allows that so

treaty aside though yeah what could you

do could you I mean could you have a

rogue state could take out our GPS

satellites okay but we render the

military

wine and then you won't be able to pick

up your uber you won't have anyone have

sex with tonight that's the range of

stuff that GPS applies to right and so

it'll affect our economy and will affect

our security and then our Navy can't

talk to the Air Force the Air Force

can't talk to it and that would be bad

mmm Army's up wars are no longer fought

just by how many soldiers have you lined

up at the border

it's what have you done strategically to

render your opponent just to render to

weaken your opponent or render them

incapable of fighting you this is why

the attacks on September 11th worked

because we had a policy that if someone

wants to hijack a plane you follow their

instructions you do not deny them their

requests because the assumption was that

if you deny their request they will

start harming people and if you follow

their requests it will delay when they

harm them if they harm them at all and

maybe everyone will end up safe it was

not in the game plan that they would

crash the plane on purpose

okay so September 12th you will never

again be able to do that to the American

plane forget the extra x-rays that we're

doing a pilot will never relinquish the

cockpit ever again no matter who they're

torturing in the back in the back of the

plane no matter what they're doing even

if it's shooting people one by one

because the plane going down takes

everybody out so that was a pretty easy

door to close literally and figuratively

but no one saw it coming you know it

drives me crazy when they put that drink

cart mm-hmm you know the hallway yeah to

protect the pilot and they opened I

asked them about that so it's just to

delay you a fraction of a second to give

them a chance to go in and lock the door

yeah right it's it's you have to get

through them and the flight attendant

that takes an extra second you can't

just run in plus you don't even allow

you to stand in the aisle while that's

happening tell you they said now if you

sit down correct so you have to get out

of your thing charge the cart and get

through the cart and

the flight attendant who will be

fighting for their life at this point

okay and because you're the plane is

everything right yeah I've seen that

opening no you can get through there

those ladies aren't gonna stop me Oh

nobody who really is physically Joe

Rogan I've already [ __ ] this through

well it's an unfortunate thing that my

mind does the point is you can I would

never do it of course you don't I I

thought about not that but I thought to

myself the plane that way because I was

like I witnessed September 11th four

blocks six blocks away from six walking

blocks for did you miss that plane hit

no because that was my view is blocked

from the south so but I have camcorder

footage of the explosion big explosion

I've ever seen

and by the way one thing I noticed is

that there was no shockwave I might have

been the closest scientist to the event

so I was all I could through was apply

every bit of physics that I know there

was no shockwave I said well how can we

have an explosion in no shockwave and I

later learned if you kind of make a

deflagration wave if you Adam I as fuel

and then you spark it then the flame

moves across the fuel it's not a it's

not a shockwave it's just a deflagration

wave and therefore there's no shockwave

and so windows are not blown out a

quarter mile away as they were in

Oklahoma City with the bomb with him

Timothy McVeigh we why am i bringing

this up what was I talking about

September 11 the plane oh yeah oh yeah

so here's something I calculated I said

if I was in a 767 and we're about to

crash into a building if I was in the

last row of the plane how much time

would elapse before the front row

crumbled and it met me in the back row

given the speed of the plane going into

the building 500 miles an hour yeah well

it's probably slower than that by then I

would say closer to 400 it's a known

speed and I don't know it but I don't

think it was because you can't turn at

that highest speed and it had to like

turn around in a name I say it's about a

second less half a fraction of a second

it's a fraction so the question is tiny

for how long does it take a plane to go

its own length right when it's going at

400 miles out yeah it's a fraction so

it's like that's it you can't even

process that so I figured the deaths

were pretty quick Wow instantaneous yes

basically instantaneous you are you are

pulverized pile of goo are they planning

on making spaceships that can shoot down

other spaceships so here so any space

wars would not be war between space and

earth it would be between stuff in space

that's all stuff in space like space

space yeah space to space yeah here's

another question they're gonna do with

all that stuff that's just floating

around up there the debris yeah how

about another task of a space force why

don't you clean up space for so that we

can have tourism and not risk our lives

by a paint chip or you know going 18,000

more bolt or nut moving at 18,000 miles

an hour that'll put a hole straight

through you Yeah right so yeah I would

like to see the portfolio of a space

force if there is a space force

broadened the scope of that to include

protecting us from asteroids and

figuring out a way to clean up the

debris of space is there a concept in

place no no no boy when you look at that

map but I know the map is not the scale

but it shows you the known satellites in

space oh well there it's it's to scale

in the sense that they're there there's

that many of them it's just as those

relative distance - but they have a lot

you can see their orbital line so it

feels crowded but it's it's so crazy

when you look at it it's just like like

it's just littered and we're continuing

to launch new things up there then I

joke I say one of the reasons why we've

never been tada a lien is because they

came to earth it what is all that junk

what oh we're not risking our lab let's

go to another planet yeah they didn't

know the map of where everything was

they had to calculate their income and

forget it they'll just take home it's

not worth it yeah I mean in when you're

on your way in you have to think about

it going around

you were visiting another planet that

had a civilization and they left a lot

of crap in their atmosphere you you

would yeah well those that's not the

debris that's those are the satellites

yeah so if you know that is debris no

you got it so so the the airforce tracks

debris as does NASA they both track

debris and sometimes launch windows of

spacecraft pieces of [ __ ] that's crazy

so we're so crazy we've only been doing

this for 60 years

so you track it right Mo's lost the

first satellite for sound Sputnik excuse

me what year 62 far away from you slap

you sorry

it was it Sputnik October 4th 1957 57

the first artificial anything in orbit

around the earth and on that day there

was only one thing one thing only Wow

from 57 to 2018 right so it's 60 years

Wow one thing that's crazy and now how

many things well there's the countless

debris there's hundreds of active

satellites there's thousands if you

include the dead ones and yes we have no

way to clean it up maybe it's some big

vacuum one day I don't know but yeah

space vacuum they'd have to be valuable

oh you know you could probably sell

space debris if you brought it back to

earth yeah people are dumb they'd buy it

speaking of debris speaking of debris

there was this asteroid that collided

with earth over chaya Binks in the

Soviet Union in Russia sorry

just near the Siberia in the Ural

Mountains just on the coast of Siberia

on the border of Siberia that was

visible to everybody in broad daylight

and he had to like avert your eyes when

it happened and they felt a shock wave

and the shock wave broke windows and

sent 600 people nearly a thousand people

to the hospital

what happened well because they saw the

light and they can't they got up from

their table and went to the window to

see what had happened there's a time

delay between the shock wave and the

light whose light travels fast and sound

travels slow so we'll go to the windows

and the shock wave hits and it blasts

broken glass into their face so it's a

big band-aid collision that we had the

injured people all needed basically

band-aids okay no one died but nearly a

thousand people were injured so at an

auction but that actually exploded and

pieces of it were recovered at an

auction I purchased a piece of that

meteorite but you know and also I

purchased some of the shards of glass

that the shock wave had broken what do

you do with this [ __ ] I've got it it's

just a habit

I'm on the part of it is a shot across

our bow that's what that no one died but

it's a warning there's no better way to

be warned than to have a band-aid cover

your injuries that could have vaporized

you or rendered your species extinct

what's crazy is the ones that don't even

make impact still do devastating damage

yes Tunguska yes that did that one

detach earth well right it incinerated

ten thousand square kilometers of forest

honk holy [ __ ]

yeah so if every 15 2013 and there is a

ways over a half a ton that Peter Rock

was a thousand pounds oh yeah holy

that's just a piece that made it through

is it iron well the actual piece would

have been about the size of this room so

a small home Wow

so that's amazing that that small rock

go back up to that again please

look at the size of that that's not that

no no that's what's left over most of it

except a per eyes on that on the

explosion as it came through the Atmos

right but they're saying that that piece

of it weighs a thousand pounds do they

give it the weight of it yeah okay he's

over a half ton yeah oh we have done

yeah a thousand pounds that's crazy

that rock is that [ __ ] heavy yeah so

it's soda so yes

well I have to read that to know for

sure but I think it was an iron

meteorite I'll tell you something would

I

a knife that was made out of a piece of

meat or as do I though the beautiful

hole yeah it's a kitchen knife that I

use Oh mine is like a it's like a

Crocodile Dundee knife oh yeah

though that's not a knife awesome ah

there's that's nice but it's waiting I

want to make a or get someone to make a

handle for it it's just that it's just a

metal that would be that would then

wedged for it's a forged metal with the

blade but then you get a pearl handle

attached to the base of oh yeah so it's

a handle this and it's an unadorned

piece of metal that would become a you

know the right oh yes sharpen oh yeah

where's the [ __ ] handle there is the

metal hey have you ever seen a kitchen

knives the metal goes all the way down

down the center of the handle and you

screw wooden handles on the sides so you

just need the wooden I just need the

wood or the or the if I'm patent they

would be purl you know yeah yeah purl

pistol yeah so so yeah it's part of

history and it's a reminder that if you

want to think about the future of

civilization you have to include a

defence plan against asteroids yeah

the dinosaurs dinosaurs I bet if they

could they would have had a space

program to not go extinct I wouldn't

know [ __ ] no is there anything that

we're doing now other than we're

occasionally looking up yeah we're

looking with monitoring and cataloging

them yeah but we don't really know what

to do yeah so happen the day would come

well we know what to do there's nothing

funded with their engineering

conferences how would you deflect an

asteroid

how would you destroy us we see one and

it's a we see one way and it's coming

100%

kiss your ass good-bye that's right we

would we would have the power to tell

you when you would die and what part of

earth it would hit yes people that have

very delusional ideas about what we can

and can't do with asteroids and that

drives me crazy

we know how did the scene the

engineering plans they look very good

but there's nothing in place right

there's project Sentinel you can look at

that is has tasked themselves with

organizing world governments to protect

Earth from species killing asteroids and

you need the world because you don't

know in advance until it's discovered

what part of Earth it's gonna hit and if

it's going to hit in the Indian Ocean

and if Indian if the surrounding regions

don't have a space program or if are the

countries that do have a space program

going to sit idle no what you want to do

is you want to have a fund and every

country pipes in a little bit of their

GDP and then or whatever but you know

you measure it however you want it

whatever you think is fair do it the way

the way the UN does it okay so there's a

tax of the world relative to your wealth

and then that money pays to save the

world when we find such an asteroid that

that's how the Sentinel project Sentinel

is is has thought this through

so if they're engineers and scientists

ample time there's possible there's a

possibility that they could actually

implement some of these plans it's all

about how much time you have because

what you want to do is go out and nudge

it alright a little bit if you a little

bit you just have to give it a sideways

velocity relative to its path towards

Earth if you do that early enough the

the sideways velocity sort of

accumulates right like ship turning

slightly over the ocean over the course

of time it'll deviate quite a bit

correct so that angle grows I mean it's

the same angle but the it spreads out

and if the the ocean example is perfect

is a perfect analogy so if you that

early enough you do it enough so that it

misses earth and it's still out there to

harm you in another day but it won't

render you extinct on that passage how

much time do we need today if I would

say we could probably get something

built in ten years oh no oh my gosh so a

year if we have a year the good thing

about species killing asteroids is that

they're large and visible what about

city killing ones them boulders slip

through yeah they'll slip through

yeah but most of Earth's surface is not

City so it'll probably hit the ocean or

land but yeah if it does it would take

out a city yeah there's a branch of

government part of I don't if it

survived the Trump changeover but it's

it's part of Homeland Security where it

worries about devastation to a region

where the grid is taken out as well so

you can't bring emergency services that

bring either food water medicines any

other form of transportation or

communication how much thaws there to

putting in a more robust grid I yeah

what you would need is that's that's a

good point

so you need a grid that can sort of

rewire itself rapidly to then bring

power to a region that's what you would

need and it would sort of doing that now

making a grid sort of lightning proof

you know power surge proof I grew up in

New York City where there were a couple

of very famous blackouts one in 1966

another in when was in 1978 I think and

there was like whoa how should this how

is this even allowed you don't have a

back-up plan yeah you'll have a way to

rewire this to redirect the electricity

so yeah you'd need that you'd want that

and I thought the new grid is supposed

to have those kinds of protections built

into it but I don't know enough about it

to comment is one one impact oh yeah one

big one yeah takes out the grid takes

out the grid and then what do you have

solar power at your place we just put in

that solar panels yeah

you lazy ever say that we have a place

in the country escape - yeah that's a

good move to have that escape spot yeah

you have a place in upstate New Zealand

yeah I used to think of it as an escape

because we thought of getting it after

September 11th got it in oh three oh two

something like that but now it's just a

good place for me to read

fuel and do a lot of good writing there

and they sort of thing look out for

ticks oh oh my god Long Island's

overwhelmed with London they got a new

tick apparently that prevents you from

eating meat

one of the vegetarians bread that think

it's followed the Lone Star tick and it

prevents you from eating the meat of

mammals yes it makes you allergic to

alpha galactose is that what it is it's

alpha gal another great radio lab

podcast yeah I died detail I think the

vegans and the vegetarians I think they

yeah I think you still eat fish

yeah not eat a mammal yes can eat red

meat it's something in red meat yeah

yeah so that's one of the challenges

yeah right goddamn ticks yeah they are

everywhere and we looked at it the other

day there's I have quite a few friends

that have Lyme disease and it's

something you do keep for life mmm and

quite a few friends like seven or eight

at this point that have devastating Lyme

disease and it's all East Coast people

yeah well they're making love in the

brush like what are they doing walking

around going for a hike yeah see I'm a

city person so even though I moved to

come I go for a hike on my deck no just

look out on the deck i but you're out

there in the this gorgeous country don't

you want to go wander around a little

bit

no no it's honestly not a thought my

wife from Alaska has those thoughts all

that but the power ticks overwhelms her

power of curiosity those are powerful

people in Alaska that's a different type

of yeah they're there they're there

they're bred differently oh they're

strong yeah those people can survive

yeah they're and they have a sentence a

unity up there it's really interesting

that unity I think comes from the fact

that they're all in the same risk

factors together yeah and if the if you

and I have the same things that can kill

us that makes us friends it's also

they're overwhelmed by nature it's like

they're overwhelmed by both its beauty

and just the sheer evidence that you're

insignificant I would say they're not

overwhelmed they are whelmed yeah

there's the right amount of whelmed I

have a buddy mine who lived up there a

grizzly bear killed a moose in his

driveway

like what right that's the kind of stuff

what in the driveway

they had to be careful like getting out

of the house Baird cashed the Moose when

we first went up there my brother-in-law

hurt my wife's sister's husband kept a

loaded shotgun over their bed so that

when the door starts rattling in the

middle of the night the the gun is in

his arms reach that was good that was

good

yeah those [ __ ] things you ever seen

one in real life

I mean zoo- not a real one real one

there's a there's a look they don't know

I did no no we visited Denali Park but I

saw it it's 500 yards away it's not

closer than that did not only Park there

a little bit habitual eyes too right

no it's really a while oh do you know I

confuse it with a Jellystone Park I'm

thinking of something different you

think in a Jellystone Park Denali Park

is where what's that near what part of

Alaska is in there it's got its got

Mount McKinley it's got Denali the

mountain right in it so Oh so where is

it it's I forgot geographically but

that's not like near the Brooks Range

right no I couldn't tell you I'm not I'm

not

mountain range this is sheer size of

Alaska when you actually look over the

United States know you can superimpose

it you know oh yeah what you want to

know another one don't know another one

yeah the size of Africa relative to

United States you've done many times so

excellent everything fits in there

everything fits like five United States

literally everything fits in there looks

like most of the world yeah that's in

there the United States plus Europe yeah

[ __ ] crazy

he's a giant place but uh what's really

interesting about Alaska is how few

people are there right you know I mean

it's such a large intensity yeah

population densities so light but but

Anchorage is a really cool City like if

you go there you're like oh this is a

cool last house yeah nice people but if

you go there in the summer bring some

things to cover your eyes oh when you go

into bed at night you're going to bed

today

yeah yeah it's yeah so so my wife said

in the winter when they go to school and

dark it's not nighttime just dark

yeah they don't use night and day it's

just our on light yeah because it's only

light for a few hours yes so that's

light and then it's dark you ever see

that movie was it called 30 days of

night vampire movie about Alaska no yeah

the vampires came to us actually I've

seen a pretty fun one in vampire movie

in mylanta like vampire moves I have

nothing against them just know that

smarts they don't talk to me they don't

I don't can't put that I don't see the

romance of getting bitten in the neck

Wow does that romance is scary actually

I think the the what's that stare right

series no no tell me you liked him the

other series underworld the under eyes

I've seen a few of those did you like

those that's fun those are the dumbest

ones know the Twilight fans make fun of

oh no I just like the fact that there's

a lead woman kicking ass those guys

women who could do your show I love

women

put on your little show love when women

are winning gasps no it's just fun well

then you must love alien the original

alien yeah talked about Ripley from

aliens Weaver

she's original female movie badass well

no no they go before and I just reminded

myself of this is it Barbara Rigg

Barbarella

no Barbara rig I think is her name she

was the woman and the original British

series of the Avengers oh yeah that's

true but that was hokey like but she was

wearing black leather that's a new

martial arts and kicked ass hmm wasn't

believable but whatever was believable

like like when she's shooting that thing

like you bought you buy it like looks

throwing this to me is like to you when

you're making fun okay mistakes that

they make in these movies about space

this [ __ ] drives me crazy people just

flipping people through the air and down

when they fly off buildings that stop

you driving me [ __ ] crazy actually I

have a tweet post it now it's too long I

gotta tell you one of those dangerous

guys doesn't put a case in your phone

you have the [ __ ] okay

Cape in your butt the back the on your

phone your lock screen is the Stonehenge

of Manhattan yeah yeah yeah yeah

Manhattanhenge no case in your phone no

you're a risk too

right no so you can think of it as

risk-taking

or when I got the phone cuz I admire how

thin this is right

I'd like technology yeah serving meek ok

so what I do when I got the phone I said

let me do this with it

ok lip it around yes and I reminded

myself why do in in the military cadets

why do they twirl their gun of what

possible value is this in combat why do

they do these things with their gun and

then I realized you're not supposed to

drop your gun ever hmm ever so if you

twirl the gun and you don't drop it

it means stuff can happen to you in

combat and it is always attached to your

body so I said so when I got my phone I

said let me just do this ok let me just

do this if I pick up the phone and so

when you do that then you never drop

your phone so it's not that I'm a

risk-taker it's that I've changed my

risk to make it so low that it is

essentially won't happen and you got

AppleCare know you didn't know your risk

take first I fix my own damn computer

second are you gonna fix your own damn

phone if the screen breaks you're gonna

get in there with a screwdriver and pop

that [ __ ] out put the new in the key

word the key phrase are there if the

screen break drop it

I also carry relatively expensive

fountain pens what happens with that I

never lose them oh I see what you're

saying if you always lose your pens

Amith you're not spending enough money

all right like sunglasses exactly bet

the same pair of sunglasses now for a

record number of time right cost you

$200 to get [ __ ] lose them they're

just my favorite one nice time for free

shout out the skeleton sunglasses Oh

skeleton optics his ice lenses

nice alright powerful [ __ ] psychic

invented the planetarium projector did

they realize they didn't make some

badass 1923 1923 yeah but the same

sunglasses now I think you're doing well

here six months this fat stupid fingers

so once you do once you get that then it

doesn't drop so it's not that I'm a

risk-taker is I've changed the risk so

that is low enough so that it is of on

part on par with other risks that you

take routinely I smoked a lot of pot

dude this is gonna drop I keep doing

this also the things if you pick up the

phone with one hand and it's upside down

you you hold it in places where the

center of gravity flips it but you also

have some sort of a skin in the back

which it's just it's just a sector of

Van Gogh's Starry Night oh yeah but it's

not it's there's no texture to this it's

just a slippery yeah oh it's a skin it's

definitely more texture you say feel

that that's slicker it's complicated

it's not wise there but my point is

there's no ways there but it will aid in

the friction a little scientists you

should recognize this friction is good

yes I mean isn't it one of the things

they decided to do to asteroids to

change their path spray some goo on them

and it'll literally cause more friction

in the air and cause them to deviate

slightly from their path no over a long

period of time I don't know where you

just pull that out of your ass pray in

that moment know I've read that I mean

it was some dummy vacuum of space there

is no friction so didn't there's some

[ __ ] they could put on the if it's

traveling right yes isn't there

something they could put on that would

aerodynamically change its path in the

vacuum of space there is no aerodynamics

okay so it's moving others by the time

it hits Earth's atmosphere it's too late

so it happens so it's what there was a

coating that they were planning on

putting on some aspect of would it be

the act of putting the coating that's

what you would do is you may be thinking

of there's a coating you can put on an

asteroid that differently absorbs

sunlight relative to the other side so

it caused it a spin that put there that

can that can create a net a vector

of motion is many asteroids could

protect the Earth from space rock threat

okay so there you go that's some [ __ ]

mm-hmm okay

change him out of sunlight reflected by

the space but you would not do that the

entire rock you do it to a part of the

rock potentially nudging it away from

Earth even the accumulated push provided

by many thermal photons as they radiate

from the app Wow the asteroids surface

holy [ __ ] yeah yeah see I didn't think

that through very well

and somehow you added KY jelly to this

I'm trying to flip this phone still yeah

yeah my friend Andrew Santino he carries

this [ __ ] around case free and I admire

him he's braver man than I do we I sent

you a list of topics did we hit all of

them yeah we hit all of them we didn't

hit innovation in all their cares

worries no no here's one Oh we'd never

even got into cars

yeah just line cars why they'll never be

flying cars yeah please okay since we're

two hours and 40 minutes in is that

allowed oh my gosh yeah we're flying no

but people don't have three hours to do

they oh we do it all the time really

yeah oh are you sure hundred percent

yeah this is not you sure yeah average

podcast right now lavage really yeah I'm

honored to please your average the ones

we've done we've all been like close to

three-hour okay here is that ding oh oh

it's rude okay so let me I flipped it I

turn that goddamn switch on okay so

let's go back to let's go back to why

anyone would want a flying car in the

first place because they're an [ __ ]

okay so here is stuck in traffic so here

at Edison everybody just watch let's say

there was only one road okay okay that

was the width of your car and you're

driving on this road and they're cars

behind you the fastest you could go on

that road is the speed of the slowest

car on the road right make sense yes

this is travel in one dimension

that sucks what you really want is

travel in two dimensions so you take the

road and widen it let's make two lanes

two lanes in one direction you have to

the other way as well this doesn't

matter here don't have too late so now I

can go around you your slow ass car mmm

okay but and that's fine this is a great

improvement on one-dimensional travel

now it's two dimensions okay I can shift

left or right as well as move forward or

backwards to move and the more lanes you

have the more two-dimensional that is

okay so four or five here in Los Angeles

what is it six lanes each is twelve

fricking lanes okay you are fully

exploiting the two dimensionality of

travel but you still have so many cars

that you say to yourself I want to

bypass this traffic if you went from one

dimensions to two dimensions bypassing

is just another lane but now all twelve

lanes are plugged and you want to bypass

it so you're thinking I need to travel

in another dimension I want to travel in

the third dimension if I do that I can

bypass all these cars I want a flying

car yeah okay well the point is we

already have flying cars they call

helicopters well the helicopters have

originally invented for that they called

helicopters they're noisy they have to

create a downward thrust of air equal to

its own weight if you're gonna have a

flying cart that's what it's gonna have

to do right they're noisy they're they

completely disrupt the terrain wherever

they fly so the issue is not that you

want a flying car you want to travel in

that third dimension hmm we already do

that how do we do that they call tunnels

they call bridges

when you have a huge intersection you

don't move people through one another

you build the you build one Road over

the other you build one road under the

other you are exploiting three

dimensions so that traffic can go in

perpendicular directions simultaneously

that's what the flying cars would have

given you but we do that at

intersections because it would be

impossible to move 12 lanes of traffic

through an intersection that crossed

another freeway New York City has done

this we do this the New York you're in

the streets there's too many cars

you can't move let's move in the third

dimension let's build a subway this

sounds like a guy who's trying to sell

me something I'm telling you later than

a flying car [ __ ] you could buy a

flying car the neat I want you to

appreciate moving in the third dimension

the New York City subway system moves a

billion people a year and they all go in

the third dimension beneath the ground

through tunnels tunnels that are layered

on top of one another well the New York

City subways this is amazing how I could

move that many people it's great but

it's not as good as a flying car it's

not as cool as a flying car but it's as

effective as a flying flying car flying

car just have to get in line you'd have

to get on the subway you don't have to

have a token you have to go to the

turnstile you deal with some guy who's

rubbing his body up against yours you

flying cars so you just fly around I'm

just saying it's like a boat tunnels but

for the air and bridges or flying cars

the beautiful thing about a boat is you

just go wherever you want to go now

here's the thing it's kind of you don't

have to call air traffic control okay

I'm turning left I'm gonna take you to

another dimension know someone will have

to know where the hell you're flying car

is going just the same way traffic rules

that matter in a street you want it's

not free fall you know it is with boats

and you know what happens if a car fails

Falls it's just on the on the ground it

just stops right

flying car fails you're dead right okay

so I want to add another dimension to

this conversation Oh a redline muskers

tunnels okay ready exactly exactly

so watch here's a desk in front of me

okay I it's a physical desk and I have a

lot of sheets of paper and and so I lay

them side by side i tile the desk with

all my sheets of paper then there's no

desk surface left I ran out of

two-dimensional space if I want to store

more pages on my desk what do I do I get

one of those organizers mm-hmm

I've just introduced a third dimension

so now I could have pages in another

dimension sitting above the page that

was previously occupying another place

that I couldn't have put another sheet

hmm that's three dimensions yes okay if

we were two dimensional people we would

wonder what happened to that sheet of

paper because we have no access to that

third dimension you it would just left

our universe at this point I'll be

trying to back out of the showroom and

I'd say thank you though I'm going to go

the flying car place so now watch but

look at how much you've increased your

storage by introducing another dimension

now imagine a fourth spatial dimension

we don't have access to that but we're

now filling all three dimensions and a

four dimensional creature we'll say

we'll just put it up in this direction

what would be the fourth dimension in

that regard you can't imagine it because

our brain evolved in three dimensions we

haven't we can describe it

mathematically maybe a wormhole and we

passages in LA so our storage needs

would become you can open the door put

it through this portal to the fourth

dimension right and close the door and

look on the other side of the door and

nothing would be there yeah just the way

on the surface of the desk if you live

in the surface test someone opens the

door they put the paper through the door

close the door you look around it you

say where did it go I have no idea

because you can't even see you came and

imagine that third dimension we cannot

imagine a fourth

but if the world one day gets so crowded

that even three-dimensional space has

traffic access to a fourth dimension

would greatly help that that's all I'm

saying

yeah good luck with that getting people

to step through I still what is this

Jamie some flying thing that just came

out oh look at this thing wait does see

that part seems CGI but it's actually

flying over grass why that's moving look

at this thing

what is it solar-powered I don't know

off the trailer like showing it

describing it is it have sound does it

make sound know what it looks like it

looks like a human-sized drone yes it's

exactly what it looks like okay what

about something like this what about

something like this with really powerful

magnets all outside the outer edge so it

repels against other drones to run a

maglev flying car so if you get so close

oh I see would be like a force field

landing each other Oh

so be like it'd be like a bumper car yes

but with with cushions yes yeah yeah

some sort of electromagnetic force field

that you know everyone agrees that you

don't have ones that are attracted to

each other but opposed by the way see

how big that human human size drunk

drone is have you ever heard how loud a

drone it [ __ ] laughs yeah you can't

you can't even have a conversation yeah

my neighborhood flies on around

that's what shotguns are for yeah I wish

I've never fired a gun in my life but

the first time I ever used one its to

shoot the drone that's gonna be looking

through my window at my apartment oh you

know this is [ __ ] [ __ ] on my

neighborhood he flies around all over

people's yards but I can't uncork they

already think I'm crazy no way I know if

I shoot it with a bow and arrow I'm not

sure I'll hit it by the way did that

video have sound accompanying with it

has some some a little bit there's music

and some description of it music but

there's not the actual sound of those

propellers you know this but they have

on their webpage here that it's quieter

than a car on a freeway what it's

quieter than an electric car nor at 150

feet away measured at a hundred and

fifty feet that's incredible because

it's about the same as a car as a car

well it says motors no count so that

they're counting that as an electric car

though

oh they are yeah yeah

Slean cars okay is that but cars today

are not in top where with just energy

consumption oh if they're using the same

icon to represent see they're using the

same so it's an electric car so it's the

sound of an electric car no no there's

no engine but no don't get deceived

there because that's energy consumption

see energy consumption uses the same

icon for electric cars it does for

gasoline car and then down no see it

says noise it shows highway just car it

doesn't tell you there's no way 76 DBA

is a sound because electric cars far

quieter than a regular car you all you

here's the drone of the tires no but

what happens is above a certain speed

the the aerodynamic noise is greater

than the so in a landing airplane so

here's what you do you live in LA go to

the in and out near LAX which is right

near a landing strip okay yeah and

listen to the sound of the planes as

they come as they come in for landing

most of that sound is airfoil noise not

engine noise ah yeah which is why you

can pretty much still maintain a

conversation you're old enough we

remember a plane would fly overhead in a

city and you'd have to halt your

conversation until it finished why what

happened

engines got quieter and quieter which

enabled people to build real estate

closer and closer to airports and not

have not have a sound problem that's

poor [ __ ] but they didn't happen

overnight there was slow and steady no

kidding

yeah I never Boyle boys I forgot that

you had to stop talking when I remember

it in fact Shea Stadium in New York City

near near LaGuardia Airport the the

ouncers had to stop anytime a plane flew

over it they couldn't they couldn't

announce the game that's crazy and when

the Mets were in the World Series in

1969 Mayor Lindsay redirected the

airport traffic to not fly over the

World Series games

Wow I thought that was a badass move

event of his mayor Lindsay yeah I

completely forgot how loud planes used

to be correct and now they're now there

it's a sound that's in the in quote the

noise of the street you don't even stop

and notice it you didn't even pay

attention at all you barely hear you

barely hear it and so next time you're

at a runway

and when it's landing it's much noisier

taking off because it's got a gained

altitude but coming down it's most of

that sound is glider noise and evidence

of this is is the noise of air going

over the airfoil of the the fuselage if

you do you know the moment they deploy

the the landing gear next time you're in

an airplane when they say we are cleared

for landing just listen listen to the

ambient sound of the plane then listen

to the sound after they deploy the

landing is for three times as loud it

ramps up hard part because of the sound

of the air going around something is not

aerodynamic the freaking wheels oh yes

yeah yeah yeah I just never for whatever

reason I never remembered that airplanes

used to be louder mm-hmm yeah I think

about all the time so why can't I have a

flying car

it's too you want the drone flying car

yeah yeah so you need it you wouldn't

want it

that would look ugly if two of those

colliding in the sky but what about my

magnets here what do you what do you

what night now it's got to have more

power to lift the weight of the magnet

solar bro plus you get some testosterone

infused guy who doesn't want to let you

ahead of them try to bump you then you

break the propeller and then you both

fall out of the sky sky rage sky rage oh

it's a lot of AI rage we know it'll do

it'll call the herd of testosterone

driven men okay but what if they do it

but the only way they work is through

like the same sort of Tesla system that

allows them to have you know ya know if

you have automated cars

you don't need flying cars yeah you do

because first we too many of know

there'll be fewer cars on the road but

how do you figure that

oh my gosh automated cars fewer cars yes

how so how so how so because because

what your second greatest asset your car

most people's second greatest asset

spends 90% of its time doing nothing you

drive to work in it's parked oh you come

home and it's parked 90% of his time

doing nothing okay

I come to work ten minutes after you a

half hour after you an hour after you

I'm using

car you ain't using my clutch you tell

you right now you're not using my car no

one's using your face car I forgot this

is La did you go to New York happen okay

for people with a quick steal your car

is a utility rather than a something

you're trying to get chicks with on the

street corner oh stop people try to get

chicks in New York - don't drop with the

cars there's a lot of people to do

nobody has cars but if you do you're a

baller you got one of them spots it cost

you a thousand bucks a month baby

I've seen some fancy cars when I've been

in New York there's some fancy codes but

that's not it's not it's not a hundred

percent it's not a hard percent yeah but

that's just that one stupid spot where

you could still own the car there but

you'll be delegate relegated to a lane

where you won't be able to drive as fast

as the automatically consider that if

you're in a self-driving car and it

wants to change lanes it communicates

that to other self-driving cars near it

there's self-driving cars tell you to

[ __ ] off the Joe Rogan upload I feel

like it wouldn't change anything if

there's automated cars in Los Angeles I

really do I don't think I don't think

there'd be any less traffic I just think

they're gonna make a lane that'll take

automated cars and it'll go 120 miles an

hour and watching everybody with their

wasted horsepower in there in there is

negative traffic stuck in traffic yeah I

was tweet I was in LA and I was in like

a Prius and we passed a Lamborghini

doing 40 miles an hour and that was just

seemed so embarrassing mmm - the

Lamborghini still maybe doing 30 miles

out we're doing 40 miles an hour we

passed away better no it was like why do

you have a Lamborghini because there's

some times when there's no one on the

road you got a Lamborghinis Drive late

at night the Lamborghini is the peacock

feathers as best as I can judge your

Jevon one no they're wonderful its merit

marvel of engineering and science I

should appreciate it it's good they can

go zero to 16 two and a half seconds

you're still burning gas oh you don't

like gas

not if I don't have to did you prefer

electrical if you had a car if you lived

it if for whatever reason the

planetarium decided look Neil you're the

best ever and we opened up the most

amazing spot ever it's in Los Angeles

California would love you to relocate

and bring a start on the car I'd if I

was forced to relocate and I had only

one car I'd get an electric car probably

attempt to get a Prius or a Tesla would

you go oh definitely testicle oh yeah

you wouldn't yeah I mean like you know

performance clothes Cheez Whiz Prius I'm

just saying edge that's an important car

that set a lot of other manufacturers

into motion yeah try to you know if

there's a dynamic it's a shitbox it is a

dynamic that's where nice car least one

thing happens and then you drive

something else makes that happen but

when you plug your car into the wall

you're not asking yourself I wonder

where this power comes from it could

come from any one of a dozen sources

right like hydro it could pet solar

panels a tidal energy you could come

from nukes it could come from oil or

coal come from any of them what about

clean coal have you heard about this

clean coal the president's been tweeting

about it clean coal all capital letters

like whoa

I didn't know about that I thought it

was just [ __ ] cold yeah I don't so

here's my point if you can if you can

power things with a choice of a dozen

sources of energy then those sources of

energy compete with one another for your

business mmm as the price of oil goes up

you say I'm not going to generate power

with oil we're gonna use that and I have

a wind farm and I come online I'm going

to sell you my wind energy and and I see

you're the power company you buy my wind

energy you send that power to the wall

outlet and you charge in your car don't

know and don't care where that energy

came from Wow there's a book called

turning oil into salt look it up so we

can mention drain oil and assault

correct why would you do that there was

a day when salt was a strategic

commodity yes there was no other known

way to preserve food from the autumn

harvest to

the spring set of crops so food got

salted okay yeah that's there's the book

what's the woman's name again left and

an Corrin okay so I'm now describing the

thesis of that book okay

turning oil went to salt so here's what

you do so we had salt if I took away

your assault reserves you would starve

over the winter so everybody knew where

their salt came from everybody knew how

much their salt cost do you know do you

realize that Grant General Grant destroy

the salt reserves of the Southern

Confederacy knowing that that would

force them faster to surrender because

they wouldn't have food reserves to last

through the winter I growing up Ned did

not understand the phrase you are the

salt of the earth salt gives you high

blood pressure what do you what do you

mean the salt is stop saying that sodium

does No yeah doesn't have too much right

no yeah no let's get that in a minute

let me finish the thing so they give

them something wrong with you for that

so there's whether it's chronic or not

that I agree with you there feel chronic

high blood pressure it's not just us

right right but I I can increase my

blood pressure now by not peeing and

taking an ingesting salt by not peeing

why would you not pee well because you

retain the water and it gets good pump

through this is what the salt does you

retain the liver and let me get back to

the okay so so I said salt of the earth

why is that a compliment I remember

thinking of myself but there was a day

when salt really mattered okay all right

so um so what happens the nineteenth

century

we figure out how to can foods mmm you

can have berries and put them we can

then we you seal you can make preserves

the name of the food is what it is right

it's preserved okay so now week that's

another way to protect your food to have

it last through times when you don't

have crops wait a minute refrigeration

get we have a lecture

I can refrigerate wait a minute

I can now freeze food hmm

I got a half dozen ways I can eat over

the winter and only one of them is salt

so now salt has lost its strategic value

lost his mojo lost his mojo it's still

there we still eat salted foods and as a

you know over flavor but it's a

different thing culture it's a different

thing now it's a matter of choice not a

matter of necessity a lot of great foods

came out of that you know the salted

pork and the bacon and the very tasty

foods came out of that movement okay

so right now when you buy salt do you

know where it came from

no unless you get Hawaiian salt they

should get gourmet salt from earth foods

you just buying Morton Salt you know

where it came from no do you remember

how much it cost

no it's too cheap grieve if you'd even

remember that okay if you're gonna turn

oil into salt what you're doing is

you're turning energy into salt that's

the value of a plug in the wall design a

car that can run on five different kinds

of energy then oil has to compete with

the other kinds of energy

oh I see what you're saying so have an

engine that's works on hydrogen correct

yeah yeah yeah if you sells batteries so

they have hybrids now that work on two

different things it's a start but my

point is if you do that then we no

longer fight wars for oil maybe you

don't fight for freedom

how about freedom bro freedom isn't free

free we just did three hours three hours

holy crazy how time flies by dude
