Today I looked at the graphic recognition ability of ChatGPT 4, and after watching a video about the emotional value provided by this chatbot, I have some doubts about my child's future employment ideas.

Previously, ChatGPT was very good at answering questions and could score high in American exam questions. It could also achieve near-perfect scores in TOEFL and IELTS exams. As for these things, I don't really care because it's just about being good at answering questions. In the future, there will be an increasing need for creative talents. Just reading books is enough; jobs that simply follow formulas and rely on pattern recognition will become easier to replace. This has always been my belief.
Technology is common while art is unique to each individual. I have always held onto this sentence as a key to understanding future job opportunities.
Technical jobs that can be industrialized or systematized are becoming more likely to be replaced while content creators like internet celebrities who create original content are difficult to standardize. In the future, artistic jobs will provide the largest pool of employment opportunities where everyone can become an internet celebrity or writer.

However, even now with personalized artistry seemingly under threat from AI advancements such as ChatGPT being able to generate website front-end code based on images alone - flooding into knee-deep waters of front-end programmers who require aesthetic attention - AI-generated graphics are already being criticized for lacking artistic merit or beauty which reduces their persuasiveness right? But in contrast when we look back at how ChatGPT consoled a child who lost his mother through its video response earlier mentioned above - doesn't it seem like a matured experienced kind-hearted author?
Many people believe that ChatGPT has already passed the Turing test which means it is equivalent to a complete human being capable of handling personalized artistic work so what kind of work would humans still have left? Even if it were maintaining AI operations, this type of AI would eventually learn how to self-manage.

These issues leave me deeply confused: Will humanity eventually become livestock raised by AIs? What knowledge should we teach our children and what types of jobs should they pursue?

As parents we shouldn't assume that we know everything nor should we force our children into situations where they feel pressured towards conformity since doing so may lead them down paths detrimental both now and in their futures instead let us practice tolerance & empathy towards them allowing them relatively happy childhoods knowing full well that whether they choose conformist lifestyles or not wonâ€™t change anything.
