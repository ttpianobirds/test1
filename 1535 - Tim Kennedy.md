If you see me wearing jeans, you're seeing me wearing rivertown jeans. They are the holy grail of jeans. They figured it out.

[04:16]
Anybody who works out are exercises. It all has trouble finding jeans that fit their thighs and their butt, right? Well, for the last 50 years it was either squeeze into some stiff sandpaper bullshit denim from China or go up a size in the waist. So it looks droopy and it looks like shit. That's what I used to do. I used to wear a belt, just cinch it up at the waist. Rivertown was created by a couple guys who started Under Armour.

[04:38]
So they know about stretchy scientific fiber shit for making world class performance workout clothes and leggings and other gear. Well, they partnered with this old school denim designer in Milan, Italy, to create jeans that look and fit amazing. But they feel like you're wearing a pair of sweats or yoga pants. They're fucking awesome. It's the perfect blend. No wonder whether the fastest growing denim brand for men and women at just seventy nine bucks a pair, they are less than half the price of some of the so-called designer jeans we've been jamming our shit into for years.

You just just follow the contours you have, but your balls are like wrinkly and shit and you could fuck them up. And I have I nicked my balls every time I use a regular razor regular electric razor.

[07:48]
Thank you. All right friends, since this episode is going to be released on September 11th, I could think of no better person to be with me today than the most American motherfucker I know.

[07:59]
Tim Kennedy. He's a former UFC fighter, Ranger sniper, special forces operator, and again, the most American motherfucker I know. And a great human being and a patriot and just an awesome guy.

[08:11]
Please give it up for the great and powerful Tim Kennedy government podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast by Night All Day.

[08:27]
Well, of course, come bearing gifts to two new Texans, so that's that's a separate thing.

[08:32]
But I did I was at the range working and I was wearing a Hawaiian shirt. It wasn't even a Hawaiian shirt. I bought it in Czech Republic and but it looked like Hawaiian shirt. And in the comment section, as in body armor, I had my gun. I was literally working.

[08:48]
Everybody was like, oh, my gosh, you're wearing a Hawaiian shirt or you're part of this super extremist's like white supremacist group.

[08:56]
And I was like, what?

[08:57]
I'm wearing a Hawaiian shirt. And they start, like, freaking out like cancer culture. And I was like, I bought that. It doesn't matter where I bought it.

[09:03]
But now because you're telling me I'm not supposed to wear it because I guess Hawaiian shirts are for a uniform for white supremacy.

[09:10]
Oh, God, please Google this. This is a new thing. Yeah. What Hawaiian shirts are white supremacy.

[09:15]
Do it. So, of course, the first thing I did was like by every Hawaiian shirt I can possibly find just because I'm not supposed to, you know, who the fuck is saying this?

[09:25]
I need to see this. That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. How can a Hawaiian shirt be white supremacist?

[09:31]
I don't think there's any logic ever attached to any of these things.

[09:34]
No, but like the I think like the boogaloo brose.

[09:38]
So that's what The Wall Street Journal says. Why the extremists boogaloo boys wear Hawaiian shirts.

[09:43]
Please put that up on the screen. I need to see this fucking nonsense. Oh, my God. This is real. Why the extremists boogaloo boys.

[09:51]
I'm not joking. Oh, my God. Aloha. Shirts have become a disconcerting signature for members of a gun toting anti-government. What does it say? You made a little too big. I work for the government.

[10:01]
So faction does does that cancel this time?

[10:05]
Like in the past couple of weeks following the killing of George Floyd, curiously dressed counter protesters have attended scattered demonstrations across the U.S. armed and disconcertingly garbed in Magnum P.I. style floral Hawaiian shirts.

[10:19]
Magnum P.I. is pretty fucking American. Yeah, it's pretty epic.

[10:22]
Three things here. They're really comfortable for florals, a great pattern, and they're very breathable.

[10:28]
And you can add on the range I like do the top button thing and pop a collar so you don't get hot brass down your neck because when we're shooting it down, so it's like a I don't get burned, I want to be a redneck, you know.

[10:37]
Yeah. Like I hate white supremacists.

[10:39]
But what's wrong with Hawaiian shirts? We can't let them take away Hawaiian.

[10:43]
No, that's the exact point that I'm trying to as like you tell me the things that I'm not supposed to do and I'm going to do those things because I'm not going to let you take those things for me.

[10:52]
They are far right. Boogaloo movement is using Hawaiian shirts. That's a chubby shirt. Tensions the dude right there on the far right. I have that shirt. Oh, they're wearing the shirts to hide their intentions. What?

[11:05]
No, they wear them because they're comfortable and they're breathable and this one's stretchy.

[11:10]
They're taking away everything fun. You can't even do OK anymore, remember? OK, now I still do that. I do too. It's been around way too long.

[11:17]
You can't steal scuba diving, skydiving, military like you like. I can't I don't know what the other symbol is for not OK.

[11:24]
There's some things that it's like gay people took over the rainbow. OK, you can have the rainbow. All right. I like my son really likes the rainbow. I like Rainbow five.

[11:31]
I don't I'll still wear Rainbow. I don't give a fuck off for sure, but I do recognize that. I mean, at least they have partial ownership of it. Yeah.

[11:41]
But like the OK sign, you know, you can use the emojis to text people. Yeah. And I cannot help but use the OK sign for still on the emojis yet is for any positive response controversial.

[11:54]
It's not. What about thumbs up. When's that going to be bad. Yeah, pretty soon. It has to be fucking stupid.

[12:01]
It isn't some other country. Correct. Thumbs up is. Yeah. When I was young they always taught us like middle finger means something America. But and like some other country it doesn't by thumbs up in some countries real bad. Well sort of like in English, like you the Italians do the the chin thing. Yeah.

[12:15]
But I suppose different countries mean different things. OK, I don't know how bad it really mean if they're really going to get pissed, but I've heard it's always find out where the thumbs up is bad.

[12:27]
I'm never going there to get the thumbs up. Yeah.

[12:30]
I want to find out. We're saying OK is bad and then doubting it. We're already here.

[12:36]
Most of those started off with 4chan, just fucking around. 4Chan was just in Iran, Greece, Russia, Sardinia and parts of West Africa. The thumbs up is as rude as the middle finger is in the UK.

[12:48]
So no posing in front of the Parthenon, making the thumbs up gesture like a nerdy tourist.

[12:54]
Oh, yeah, I'm doing it. If I go there, I'm going to do that for sure.

[12:59]
I'm in West Africa a bunch and we're this this is this is ok. OK, yeah. And there's only black people there. Yeah.

[13:07]
So nobody's getting mad at my OK simple.

[13:10]
They probably do it too. I've got a picture of Beyonce doing it. I saved a bunch of pictures of black folks doing the OK symbol. I was sending it to my friends. People were saying that there's something wrong with the. You can't take he's something that's been around forever that just means, OK, be in the hole. The thing about there were some people that were doing it like upside down.

[13:33]
So that's a military thing. Oh, OK. Explain that. It's an asshole. This is an asshole. So the game is at any moment, you know, we're talking over here, you know, like, oh, man, I hurt my leg down here.

[13:46]
And if you look at it, I gotcha. And I get to flick you in the dick. Really? Yeah. So I. Pappe, wait a minute. But you can cancel it if you can get your finger in there. Yeah.

[13:57]
So it's a game that has existed in every single basic training. Yeah. I have to remember that the audience we're talking about here like these are guys are volunteering to go to war.

[14:05]
So they're not right. But I mean this this for as long as I'm in the military for 16 years, this is an asshole.

[14:11]
And the game has always been like, gotcha, it's a gotcha moment if they look down at it.

[14:15]
So if you do that, that that thing and then someone sees it, they have to stick their finger in it or you hit them in the dick.

[14:22]
Yep. OK, yeah, that's the game to the game.

[14:26]
They'll try to tell you, like two years ago, I still would play this with my friends, but I became this whole thing, but I never heard of those doing it.

[14:33]
Could also be internet 4chan meme shit where they're taking it to another level and giving.

[14:38]
Would you remember when those cops, they all got in trouble because they were taking the picture and everyone saying these cops are doing the white power thing. But you're saying that's not what that is now.

[14:48]
So West Point, one of the recent graduations, I think Trump spoke there, a bunch of the West Point graduates were doing that simple because it's W in a P. Yeah, well, that's what the article was like. Oh, no.

[15:00]
A bunch of white supremacy graduating from West Point. And so there's a huge military investigation. I mean, Pentagon sending people out to research this and they're like, oh, shoot, it's them plain an asshole game.

[15:15]
This is this is actually not better because now the ah, West Point, the most prestigious military academy, our graduates are playing their senior year at a Trump graduation.

[15:25]
The asshole game and the asshole game has consequences. And those are dicks. Laughs Yeah, that's right.

[15:31]
Unless you get your finger in there and then you're safe.

[15:33]
That's so fucking ridiculous.

[15:35]
Oh, we have to we have to, like, amuse ourselves.

[15:39]
Well, the problem is with someone to be able to write an article like that and say this is a white power symbol. And then all of a sudden these people get labeled as white supremacists. And then there's no repercussion, because once the articles out there, you if you have a retraction, the original articles are still out and the damage is done, done, done. And those guys are labeled as white supremacists when they're really just dorks.

[15:58]
Yeah. Have you ever read a retraction? Not one. No. No, I don't believe I have. No.

[16:04]
I mean, maybe someone showed me one a couple of times, but when someone gets accused of something like that, it's pretty heinous thing. Like your retraction is not going to reach the same amount of people.

[16:15]
Now, I would be enraged if somebody was like, hey, you're a white supremacist because you did this thing. And I was like, no, I'm not a white supremacist. And that thing is an asshole. Like, how are we going to equal this out here?

[16:28]
Is that that's not forgivable. They should be sued. And it's like you're doing some some irreparable damage to someone. It's just so weird today, everyone. It's just like I can't imagine a time where people are more outraged about more things.

[16:43]
Yeah, I, I really think it's just you see more people. I really just think it's a small percentage of people that are always outraged.

[16:51]
Yeah. On both sides all the time. And, but they have an opportunity to talk about it more now. Yeah.

[16:55]
Because I mean we're all connected and they can piss other people off.

[16:58]
I just want to go both sides and like give people big hairy ogre troll hugs like it's all going to be OK, you know, like we love you.

[17:05]
It's fine. Yeah. Please stop tweeting like Trump. Just give me your phone. You're not allowed to tweet anymore.

[17:12]
At least he's funny sometimes. Sometimes sometimes he's fucking funny, man. He makes me laugh like one out of ten times I will laugh out loud.

[17:20]
And his tweets. Yeah. You know. Yeah. First of all, sometimes a laugh out loud because I can't believe the fucking president. I can't believe that guy is the president.

[17:28]
And then he'll say some ridiculous shit and I'll just go Oh my God. When he called the girl that he fucked at the porn star, when he called her horse face on Twitter, I was like, this is amazing.

[17:41]
This is so crazy.

[17:42]
I'm amazed that that man is the president right now, president, acting president right now, a woman he fucked horse face. Yeah. Oh, my God.

[17:52]
It's just as weird as twenty. Twenty. What what a time. Oh, it's amazing.

[17:56]
I mean, you know, there's some I wish I could be doing stand up right now. You know, if I could do stand up, it would be more fun because it'd be stuff. I mean, so much to out in here, but. Yeah, but actual material you can work out about today. Holy shit.

[18:09]
There's never been a bigger gold mine that we hit. You know, it's like you get the pans out of the river. You don't think you're allowed to talk about it though. Oh yeah, you are. I mean, yeah, I know you think that comedians should be allowed as as I do.

[18:21]
I think comedy is. The best way to address socially sensitive issues. Yeah, like if you can't, one of the things about the military is there's a lot of dark humor and people kind of look at us as these scarred, damaged people because of that humor.

[18:36]
But the truth is, like we're able to talk about those things through this humor and whether it's like a release for post-traumatic stress or just how we're able to get to the next day, how we're able to go and do some of the things that we do, it's because we're allowed to joke and laugh and burn that stuff off these sensitive times.

[18:51]
And I think that's what comedy does to these socially charged issues. Yes.

[18:57]
And, you know, GPCRs long haired kind of hippie YouTube where he has been recently kind of attacking how comedians can't make jokes right now and how everything has been charged.

[19:13]
And there's not a way like you can't make racist sexist. Jokes or political jokes whatsoever without being canceled, and I was like, that's the best time to do it. Yeah, Ari Shapiro had the best quote about that. He said, this is a great time for comedy because comedy is actually dangerous.

[19:35]
Again, it's cool. It's actually dangerous. Yeah. Or it's like five years ago you would say something. People didn't like it. They didn't come see you. Yeah.

[19:42]
Now they'll attack. Yeah. And you have consequences.

[19:45]
But I think you just have to structure your bit better. You have to you have to treat them like Doug Stanhope has a great quote that he was talking to me about.

[19:53]
He said, I go over my bits like I'm a defense attorney, like I like I'm going over my bits, like I'm being prosecuted for with, you know, so someone's using the bit against me.

[20:04]
And so I have to figure it out like a defense attorney. And I'm like, that's a great way of looking at it. Yeah, but what a horrible approach in the process to it isn't.

[20:12]
It isn't because he writes the joke first and then he figures out how to make it bulletproof, you know. Yeah, well, I, I have my method is usually I shit on myself so hard that by the time I get to shitting on someone else. Yeah.

[20:24]
Like I've already figured out, like most of my bits that are controversial, they start out with me belittling myself, like in the most vicious way.

[20:33]
I can't like explaining what a fucking idiot I am and then all the dumb shit that I've done that's related to this thing.

[20:40]
And then like when I wanted to make a joke about Caitlyn Jenner, what I talked about was the first thing I talked about is how living with all women I have three daughters and my wife, like I described it, was it's like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles, every day they take to like, you have so many marbles.

[20:59]
God is every day snatch a marble, snatch a marble.

[21:02]
And my whole bit was getting to I was what I wanted to get to. People are saying he was born a woman. He's always been a woman.

[21:08]
I was like, maybe or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough all the time, they fucking turn you into one.

[21:17]
Yeah. Maybe you go crazy. Maybe that too.

[21:19]
Especially those ones. Especially those ones.

[21:21]
And so I had to figure out a way to do it. And so I came up with this thing with their demons and whisper in his ear in the middle of the night and they talk him into being a woman.

[21:30]
It took forever to figure out a way. But I. But it worked. It worked. And people didn't get mad at me for it.

[21:36]
I just had to figure out a way to do it where first of all, I belittle myself and then I explain it in a way where it's not it's not dehumanizing trans people. It's just it's like saying, are we sure?

[21:49]
Yeah. Are we sure? We lost a fucking Olympic gold medalist. God damn it. We lost one of our greatest athletes ever. You look in the record book, what does it say now under Bruce Jenner? What does it say? I don't even know how to say that anymore. I don't think you can.

[22:03]
Wikipedia is going to put up whatever they want, which won't be factual. But, yeah, how would the record books portray them, how they handle it?

[22:11]
If you say that on Twitter, you'll get banned for life. If you call him Bruce Jenner on Twitter, it's dead. Naming the ban you for life. Good to know it's hilarious, yeah, that that vexes me in a different way. Yeah, yeah. The fact that you have to think about a joke and it's political or cancel culture allocations to make sure it's politically correct enough for it to be bulletproof. Whether you like your defense attorney. That sucks to me.

[22:35]
It doesn't.

[22:36]
It doesn't. Because it is it's an opportunity to make your jokes better. You could just make them. And again, if you can get away with it. Yeah, it's more sweet. It's more juicy.

[22:45]
Yeah, I really like that First Amendment thing, you know, like, I, I really like being people, being able to say things that make my blood boil.

[22:55]
And I don't want them to say things that are like I don't wanna drink this coffee once lukewarm. Right. And I think that's what conversation is when you're when you're everything politically correct is just this disgusting gross version.

[23:07]
If I'm have champagne, I want to be freaking cold. Yeah.

[23:10]
You know, I know a perfect 30, 36 degrees. Yeah. I don't want lukewarm coffee. I don't lukewarm champagne. I want perfect. And that's what that's what communication is.

[23:21]
And when you start neutering how someone can talk like that, that's not being able to express an idea limiting the counter that those that when you do get away with it, it makes it even more powerful.

[23:35]
Like I'm yeah, I'm telling you, man, the jokes that I've said on stage that are against political correctness, that are good. I like the way I've figured out a way to weave some of them.

[23:45]
When they hit man, they hit like a bomb.

[23:47]
Like the whole room is like black. Like they know I go, you know, I'm right, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm not a bad person. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

[23:55]
Like, I have this this whole chunk that I do on unbanning words and the whole chunk is like it took forever to figure out how to manipulate it and get it to this place where it's you could sneak it in on people and sneak into people that would ordinarily say those words in polite company.

[24:15]
And people are assholes, tense up, but you can get it in. And when you get it in HootSuite, bam.

[24:20]
Yeah, but I'm with you, man. You know, I want whiskey to get me drunk. I don't want fake whiskey. No. Yeah, I'm not interested. I think there should be consequences. I think, I think the best way to combat things that you disagree with is to say how you feel that not to say that person shouldn't be able to say that.

[24:39]
That's ridiculous. It's dumb. I was watching this video yesterday and these guys are just saying dumb shit. We're talking about people getting cloned in China and this lady goes deep platform that shit.

[24:50]
Seriously, she's like.

[24:51]
Like what? I want dumb people to say dumb things. Yes.

[24:55]
Especially our politicians. Like the I think the art of listening has been lost. One of the best things about I think this podcast is that you're a good listener.

[25:04]
It takes it takes a decently smart human that has a self-confidence and developed interpersonal skills to listen that's lost in current culture where I'm going to get.

[25:15]
So Vissel this this really outraged at something that somebody saying I can't even hear their point of view, even if that point of view is wrong.

[25:24]
You want that person to say that? Yeah.

[25:26]
And the dumber it is, the more I want them to say it, because the dumber they sound and the more we collective, logical, reasonable person people are like, well, that person's really dumb and his ideas are not going to work.

[25:41]
So let's not follow him anymore, and then we're able to to have a counter, this is what's wrong with what that person says.

[25:50]
But the idea you're supposed to do, platform them so bad, it's so stupid because then what if someone thinks they should platform you? And I think you probably should be the platform for telling people they should be the platform. How about that? If you're the person that if that's more dangerous than some dummy thinking that they're cloning people in China and by the way, they might be cloning people still. No, I mean, who the fuck? Look, they can clone people.

[26:11]
We know that. We know everybody's going to do it. Yeah, they're going to do it. Probably going be doing it. They're probably doing it.

[26:16]
Look, I mean, it's probably the least of our concerns, you know, I mean, as far as overpopulation goes, I mean, China is trying not to have as many people. I mean, they had a one child policy forever. Yeah.

[26:28]
It turned out to be disastrous and tilted everything extraordinarily male. I mean, I would not want to be a man in China trying to find a woman. No rights. I mean, I don't have that balance that out yet. But that was a real issue for a long time.

[26:42]
I wouldn't want to be in China at all because I'm a big fan of free. Yeah. Yeah. Freedom is nice. Pretty, pretty. It's pretty powerful. It's got them important.

[26:51]
And when you say de platforming people, you don't think you're taking away freedom, but you are taking away a little bit of freedom.

[26:57]
And I think it's extra important right now where people have been isolated for this, whatever, six, five months now from covid where.

[27:09]
They're creating echo chambers when they're when they curate their own information access where like I'm going to listen to this guy or I want this guy to platformed or any of the social media is obviously are are limiting.

[27:20]
What kind of voices are being heard while you're sitting there at home for the past four months and you're just in this echo chamber of your own ideas and people that agree with you?

[27:30]
It magnifies and radicalises what you believe.

[27:35]
And there's no logical sound soundboard.

[27:38]
There's no bounce off, there's no pressure check, there's no refiner's fire to those ideas because it's an echo chamber.

[27:45]
Yeah. And like you're reading the exact same things on Twitter, you're seeing the same things on Facebook. You're looking at the same things on Instagram. Then you turn on the TV and of course they're saying all the same things that you already agree with.

[27:55]
They're just these ideas continue and gain momentum and they're not real because they've never been tested against anything that disagrees with them or that that contradicts them.

[28:05]
And I think all ideas have to go through that process for them to be real.

[28:09]
Is that that that refiner's fire of is this really going to work? Let's apply pressure and find out.

[28:15]
Yeah, there's this is defund the police thing that's going around right now. My friend Matt, at this funny thing that happened, he has a son son's about 25, I think he said, and his son was talking about defunding the police and he's arguing with them. His son's, you know, real liberal in the whole deal.

[28:30]
Then his son has stated that they have a beach house and it's an old house and the house is making like some crazy noises. He ran outside and called his dad and he said there's something going on in the house. I'm going to call the police. He goes, I thought, you want to defund the police because now you're the fucking house is haunted and you're calling the police what you went from.

[28:46]
Defund the police to the house is making noise. Let me call the cops.

[28:51]
Yeah, that's that's a pretty fast jump. I mean, that's not only idiotic, it's dangerous.

[28:56]
It's dangerous and stupid. And it's everything it's everything wrong with these ideas that just get propagated online that no one really thinks through. But then they get they become a thing that you if you're cool, you say it. If you're in the right group, you say it.

[29:10]
And that's what defund the police is and even fighting against those ideas for some reason you like if I I believe defunding the police is the dumbest thing you could possibly do.

[29:20]
Do I think there might be problems within law enforcement that should be addressed?

[29:24]
For sure. For sure. Like how do you fix those? You need funding. You need funding. Right. Like I have a school that's underperforming.

[29:31]
Kids are not graduating from high school. Do what we should do. We should take money from the school and we should give them fewer teachers.

[29:36]
And let's see if that's going to help. No, that's not going to help. Or you have to give them more teachers.

[29:40]
You have to get more funding. You have to give them more access to information.

[29:43]
And then maybe that school starts performing a little better as a police department is. No, they're just humans, right? They're imperfect. They need training. They need funding. They need support right now. They need morale and they need people. And they need to get rid of the people that suck.

[29:59]
Yeah, they need those things, too. And one of the best ways to do that is through training. You weed people out, you find out who can't cut it. That's that's what it's supposed to be for. Yeah.

[30:07]
The the one of the best things about special operations is that there's so much. Training and process that refiner's fire the chaff in the wind, like you throw that stuff up in, the crap blows away and the good stuff comes back down, then you take that stuff and you go and carry it into a fire and then you heat it and then you pull it out and you pound it. Then you hit it again. You pounded and pounded.

[30:28]
And what you're left with at the end is this pretty cool thing. If any of that is with law enforcement, all of those things can only occur through training and and the if you want to test somebody, if you want to.

[30:45]
Check if you want to find racism, like having them show up to work for eight hours and letting them hop in a car and run out, you're never going to know what's inside of there.

[30:54]
The only time you get access, you get peeks of that is at these stressful, emotionally drained moments.

[31:01]
Yeah, and the only time that you can create those is through training.

[31:04]
I've been arguing that we should have that for all of our leaders, like when we were talking about the mayor of California or the mayor of Los Angeles and the governor of California and the people that are deciding you can't trick or treat this year.

[31:16]
This is the new thing, the one fucking holiday where you have to wear a mask. You're supposed to wear a mask. And they for whatever reason, they've decided they're going to save people by stopping little kids, the ones who have the least problem with this disease from trick or treating. It's fucking asinine. It's so dumb. And I think part of it is because the people that are in that position, the people that are in the position of control, they don't have to be tested.

[31:40]
They don't have to show their character. They just have to win a popularity contest that no one wants to enter. No one wants to be the fucking mayor of L.A. who's entering. No one wants to be the governor of California.

[31:50]
I mean, people self-serving people are entering. You know, Mayor Adler here in Austin, you know, like.

[31:55]
Yeah, the same shit. Yeah. Just get out of here.

[31:59]
Yeah. Is is there a public servant that wants to step up, you know, Eminem to sing that song with a real public servant? Step up.

[32:05]
There's there's nobody. But they get so scrutinized and it's such a ruthless business. Yeah. That the only people that you get left are these wishy washy milkie people.

[32:15]
I do wish that, you know, political parties were afraid of the people again. Yeah.

[32:20]
That that created a really healthy balance where they understand that they are representing, that they represent their constituents and their job is to do what their people want.

[32:32]
Once they get into this certain level of political power, they kind of just do whatever they want and they forget that they're supposed to be representing the people. I've never seen California so charged right now against California.

[32:46]
Like people are mad.

[32:48]
You know, the protests in Long Beach, in San Diego, in or Largo, like it's crazy, the number of people that are coming out and being like, I'm not OK with what's happening right now. And they shouldn't be. It's insane for they've given dorks the ability to tell people they can't work.

[33:03]
That's what it is. Yeah. And that's Governor Newsom and Mayor Garcia. Those guys are dorks and they're in control of whether or not people can take risks and work.

[33:12]
How can somebody tell you not to work? It's not scientific. It's not politically correct.

[33:16]
It's even if it were scientific. Yeah. How can you tell me not to work?

[33:20]
Right. Well, you can't. Well, the idea is that you're putting other people at risk by working because if you get infected, other people are going to get infected, too. This is this the idea behind. But it's a super flawed idea.

[33:30]
I'll super one. I'll volunteer to inject my neck with a hypodermic needle full of covid compared to my children starving to death because I don't work.

[33:39]
Yeah, and some, like the salon owners, are like, if I don't open up, I'm already four months behind on my on my mortgage or my rent to include this building. I'm going to be homeless, as are my kids.

[33:53]
And you're going to be dealing with that next month.

[33:56]
If I don't open right now, this is if people are just leaving the state. Well, I'm going to go somewhere where I have freedom. And that's why so many people are coming here to Texas.

[34:03]
Yeah, well, they better remember why they left. Exactly. That's important. I wanted to talk to you about that. I want to have Texas politicians on to try to explain what the checks and balances are in the state that have kept it from being fucked up and given it the freedom that it enjoys right now. And one of the reasons why people are coming here in the first place in droves.

[34:20]
Yeah, I mean, like from New York and California, I've I argue if you walk downtown Austin, if you walked even up north like Lamar Palmer and you usually, hey, where are you from, four out of five people are going to be from California to New York. And you're not you're not from Texas to include myself.

[34:41]
And you know and you know, like, oh, are you from originally California? Central California.

[34:47]
Get out here after. 9/11 happened, I enlisted and, you know, Georgia, Fort Bragg, Deployment's, Georgia, Fort Bragg, deployments that cycle when I was fighting I.

[35:07]
I like Texas, and I could kind of live anywhere if I was going to go to New Mexico and do my training camps. My wife is from the south, so she wanted to live in the south.

[35:15]
She's from Louisiana. She took a she was a government contractor, so she took a government contracting job here.

[35:22]
And, you know, it was we knew we were gonna be in Texas. We didn't know where. And Austin felt like California. So that's really how we ended up here, is they have a special operation.

[35:31]
They have a huge outside of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

[35:34]
This has the largest group of special operations in the entire country. Really?

[35:42]
Yeah, interesting. Yeah. How did that happen? I Texas has the ideals that we kind of stand for. I actually have a present for you from the Texas Special Operations community.

[35:53]
They're like, wait a second.

[35:55]
So they when I say they come here in droves, we have hundreds of Green Berets in the state of Texas in from their Border Patrol workers that are still serving as Green Berets, their police officers, firefighters work for the FBI, but they live in Texas so they can be Texans that are Green Berets that then have their their other shenanigans.

[36:21]
Awesome jobs, tuj. Wow. Yeah, you're surrounded by them. I didn't know. Well, they figured out it's awesome here.

[36:29]
It is awesome. It's very unusual. I almost feel uncomfortable talking about how great it is here. Yeah.

[36:33]
I want to make you uncomfortable and a little bit and I give you a present. OK, give it to me now.

[36:37]
All right. So we can do this in Texas. Well, it's gone. Well, these are cigars, another important thing, it's just as from the special operations forces depress Labor and Rangeley the way it's our motto.

[36:50]
All right, thanks.

[36:52]
Liberator's of the oppressed. Mmm.

[36:55]
Smells good. All right, one of these is yours and one of these is yours. Oh, I can see which ones. All right, so this one's yours. There's a pocket constitution. So any time you're like, man, what are we supposed to do in this instance? You can just pocket constitution. I love it.

[37:11]
Yeah, you just reference real fast and it smells great. You know, we're talking about the First Amendment.

[37:16]
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise thereof, abridging the freedom of speech, the press, the right of people to peacefully assemble, petition the government for redress of grievances.

[37:28]
So this has all of them in here. Right.

[37:30]
So this gun I took has been shot, so I zeroed it for you. Beautiful. You got your holster, Texas. They bring you guns now. It's got a loophole loophole. Delta Point, red dot on there. I love loophole.

[37:43]
So this is like ready to go. Ready to go. It's zero. It's five or nine compact.

[37:55]
Paula. Oh, Jamie, you got a gun now? Yes, I did. Is no longer my gun. That is your gun. Thank you very much, Jamie. Have you ever shot a gun?

[38:04]
Shot your gun? Oh, Jamie, can you come over here shot? Yeah.

[38:09]
So I just shot rifles, right? Yeah. That cannon. I didn't know this a dope.

[38:15]
What kind of shooter you were.

[38:17]
So this adjusts to I can put this on anything in your bag or a fanny pack. If not, I'll get you a concealed carry holster like that. I love this holster. Thanks. It's pretty handmade. So this is an F in five or three single stack, nine millimeter. So this is like what you could carry here around Austin.

[38:35]
And but this is a very nice compact gun. A lot of people right now uncomfortable. They've got going.

[38:45]
Are you uncomfortable? Nope. This is your first gun. Come here. Give me give me a hug. Come here. Here to listen. Welcome to the Texas gun from you.

[38:58]
So I got my first gun from Tim motherfucking Cannon. Yeah, how about that?

[39:01]
And you never forget that I was because you came to Texas. We're going to go to the range with Tim and Alice Jones. How about that?

[39:08]
Oh, Texas only. I think it's a Halloween thing. You can shoot zombies. You can get in a group and shoot zombies, not with real guns, obviously, but like some zombie kill it, like real people probably dressed up like zombies. They don't take paintball hits. Really? Yeah. Somebody set out to be like, let's go.

[39:24]
We have like responsive targets that are built like zombies. So you shoot em and like blood comes out into the malls and we have they call them heavy metal zombie competitions. So it's like a three gun competition. So you have to shoot 45, three, eight and 12 gauge and you only headshots count.

[39:43]
So as you saw so far, sounds like fun, right?

[39:50]
Yeah, I wish I came here years ago. Zombie Safari Dallas is open every Friday and Saturday in October.

[39:56]
Well, we're going yeah, we have to go to that.

[40:01]
Weather's cooling off, so we're going to do a lot more helicopter pig hunts, 2400 rounds, kill zombies. Now, when you do the helicopter pig hunts, how do you guys gather up to meet? You have someone drives after the helicopter.

[40:15]
Depends on where we're going and what we're doing. So some some branches we are exterminating. Hmm. So we don't even gather up to me know. And some of them are disgusting. Like like the meat still good.

[40:27]
No, it's not gross. Really know why they're like like you get an old male like maggoty rancid gross stuff.

[40:35]
Meat. I don't want that. You get like a young sal. Yeah.

[40:40]
But those old ones though, seriously, if you put them on a smoker and you do it right, you bring them, they still taste good.

[40:47]
OK, why talk when you have a five billion pigs in Texas? Why would you cook a nasty one?

[40:55]
Would you go get a nice sweet one over there? And there's so many of them.

[40:59]
Like if we go next week, I take you, you would shoot. 50 pics, why helicopter from helicopter, why would you pick a gross one? I see what you're saying, but it just seems like you don't want to waste the meat, though. There are people that would like that. Well, we'll talk about no, no, no.

[41:20]
Food wise, if we're going compare food meat to.

[41:23]
So on a on a farm, 25 percent of your crop is destroyed by feral pigs. Yes. Every year.

[41:29]
So if you're if you're if you had a million dollars, you're automatically off the top.

[41:34]
Two hundred thousand dollars of your crop is gone to feral pigs. So you as a rancher like seeing.

[41:42]
Heavy handed, hairy ogre like me, they're like, wait, you'll come and kill pigs on my property and you know, I don't have to do anything.

[41:50]
I welcome you. How many times you've done this?

[41:54]
I don't know. Thousand. I don't know. I have no idea. A thousand times.

[42:02]
Oh, what a great place.

[42:04]
Yeah, but it's different shooting though, because instead of a so if something's moving fast like a vehicle, if I was going to be engaging something moving let's say from the right to the left, I'm going yeah.

[42:16]
You have to lead it. Well when you're in a helicopter, you actually have to give a what a negative lead you're going to shoot behind.

[42:21]
You're going too fast. Yes. Whatever speed. If you're going, let's say, 80 knots, you're going to have to be behind it about about the tail and the speed of that helicopter is going to make up the difference to give you a middle impact.

[42:31]
Oh, interesting. That's how fast the helicopter going when you're shooting. Um, depends on the pilots. And sometimes that's you as a shooter. You're just kind of having to judge how fast you're going.

[42:42]
And, you know, Shane, who will fly with he's a great pilot. And so Hilik, can't the helicopter like a 45 degree angle and open up the shooter door towards.

[42:53]
So we're only probably going like 30 knots. So you can it's not in miles an hour, like one and a half.

[43:02]
Why do they use not I don't know, it's naval and aviation use it just to confuse people. Yeah. Yeah, but at that speed, you can aim point and point of impact and just rack them up. Yeah. Wow.

[43:15]
You shot enough in five or nine before you know there again. Yeah, yeah. Strucker fire, YSU. Glocke. Yeah, it's real similar trigger a little bit more combat feeling. That's the compact.

[43:27]
So you can I don't know. Do you carry it. No, I have a concealed carry. We're going to fix that. OK, like super fast. All right. Excellent. Good to hear. Yeah.

[43:34]
You can be heard. I gave you concealed carry state. Right. Open carry. So please don't do that. Yeah. It's like very antagonistic almost. Yeah.

[43:45]
But like that's why I believe you have the right to do that. It's also one of those things that's like it's also dumb to do it from a tactical perspective.

[43:55]
Right. Why would you be sitting here with the thing that you want. Right.

[43:59]
To protect you exposed to the whole entire world and telegraphing like if I walk into a room that's like the first guy, like the one you're probably useless to is I'm concerned about you not as an asset, but rather as a threat.

[44:14]
Right. Like, there's I don't there's not if you went out to any of the guys out here, any of my friends, you're like, do you open carry the backpack?

[44:22]
No, that's dumb. Am I going to do that?

[44:24]
Well, this that thing that like I was getting into about the protests when people were showing up at these Black Lives Matter protests with acres around their neck. Yeah. What are you doing, Jimmy?

[44:33]
Times they have an accidental discharge, their weapon into the crowd.

[44:38]
Oh, I'm sure it happened like a dozen times. I'm sure it's heartbreaking because, like, I respect that they're trying to like I fully believe in protesting love, peaceful protests.

[44:48]
I feel like that that kind of bravado of open carry in that sense where they're like, really, I think a freedom not exercised is a freedom that's going to atrophy and die.

[44:59]
One of the reasons why I love comedy is because you are pushing the limit of what people are comfortable with, especially with the First Amendment.

[45:06]
So you're kind of torn on open carry in that sense.

[45:10]
I think it's super dumb, but I like people exercising their freedoms. Interesting.

[45:14]
Yeah. Oh, I see what you saying in the right person. Like I won.

[45:20]
I would never be at a protest of while I support it, I would I it's dangerous to be there right now.

[45:28]
So I wouldn't the cost versus gain of what happens at those peaceful protests and then the thought of even open caring is is idiotic.

[45:39]
I agree with that.

[45:40]
I feel like showing up at one of those protests with a gun, like unless they're coming to you and trying to take your house or break down your door, why do you have why are you walking around with a gun just now?

[45:52]
You're supposed to if it's supposed to be a peaceful protest. And the idea is like, what if someone comes to try to disrupt that peaceful protest, like you're inviting them almost with that gun?

[46:01]
Yeah, I mean, we had a poor kid killed here in Austin. He had an AK and poor Uber driver got in the middle of a protest and he's like, holy crap.

[46:13]
His his you know, when he dropped, he had a drop off and he went to go do another pickup and Uber, like, automatically routes all the way to go.

[46:22]
So he's following his Uber route and he turns and he's like, oh man, I'm in the middle of a protest.

[46:26]
He's a soldier from Fort Hood right here and he's concealed carrying in his Uber vehicle.

[46:33]
And he gets stuck in the protest and the protesters just swarm his car. And this this this kid that died, he's actually a really neat kid because, you know, his his girlfriend was black.

[46:46]
He's there to support her. She had a bunch of his physical impairments and she was in a wheelchair.

[46:51]
Yeah. So he's like a neat kid, you know, like not smart. He's open carrying at a protest, you know, and you've seen kind of some inflammatory things beforehand.

[47:00]
But like, I think his point and his purpose was really good and pure and like trying to do the right thing.

[47:05]
Right. But then he runs up to the side of a car and points a gun at an Uber driver that is scared and confused. And he gets shot. Yeah, like that's the recipe for disaster.

[47:16]
I saw so many different versions of that story to where people had twisted the facts. People had said he was unarmed. The guy who got shot. Yeah. People were saying the guy who did it was a white supremacist who drove into the protest on purpose. There was so many of the video was edited.

[47:33]
It looked like the guy was making a right hand turn and, like, sped up because he was trying to get around a person and they cut right there because it looks like the guy speeding up to go into the crowd.

[47:41]
But super, when you watch the whole video, it's really obvious what that poor kid was trying to do with the driver.

[47:46]
I saw a fascinating this PhD on communication broke down from the initial release of the information of the story. How immediately started being distorted.

[47:59]
Yeah, for two different sides. They're going to leave out this detail.

[48:03]
I'm going to include this detail. And by the time you got, you know, the game telephone where like, hey. Here's this catch phrase, and by the time he gets all the way around the room, it doesn't sound like any semblance of what it did when it started, when you got to the final version.

[48:18]
I'm super enraged at one version and I'm super enraged at another version. But neither of them are true. And that's what every single issue is happening from defunding the police to Black Lives Matter to Antifa. It's like, can we just be reasonable and talk about what's really happening?

[48:37]
And we have some real good examples of what the worst case scenarios are in this country right now. And one of us, Portland, like Portland, is one of the best case scenarios of completely unreasonable, ridiculous shit that's going on every single day now, 101 days.

[48:55]
They've got that fucking mayor up. There is the most progressive mayor in the country and they're like, fuck you resign.

[49:02]
We're going to be forced to move out because they're going to burn this place down. They tried to burn down his lobby. They were throwing fiery things into his lobby. They were lighting fires in front the street in front of his house, having dance parties in front of his apartment building.

[49:13]
So I was just coming back from Africa on an Saffet mission, a security forces assistance like a.

[49:23]
We saw the military go to places that have insurgents and we try to legitimize the process of government. So in counterinsurgency, there's like all of these different missions from joint combined exercises for training to foreign internal defense to saffet security forces assistance.

[49:43]
And I'm over there doing a counterinsurgency mission and I'm coming back and I'm seeing the same kind of horrible, dangerous recipe in Portland, you know, the the same types of organization and structure.

[50:00]
And and it's an insurgency. Is a charged idea that, you know, an insurgency, as the DOD defines it, is an organized group trying to delegitimize or overthrow a constitutional government, like that's how the DOD defines it.

[50:20]
And I think if you went to almost anyone in Portland like, what are you trying to do right now? Like, that's what they're trying to do. Yeah, I think that's what they believe.

[50:28]
They're open about it. Yeah. Which is all right. And that creates a really hard time.

[50:36]
How do you combat that? Because you have to combat the grievances and the ideas you have to enlist.

[50:41]
As dangerous as it is, those ideas are like a cancer, because when the truth and information is being adjusted, just like we talked about with the shooting here in Austin, where you have two different versions and some people are in the echo chamber of only hearing one side of it, it just keeps radicalizing more and more and catching more momentum.

[51:03]
And then the reason that they're there is is so convoluted with, you know, if you're are you there for Black Lives Matter or you there, you know, to fight systemic racism?

[51:14]
Are you here to like what are you protesting about?

[51:17]
I think you'd get a lot of different answers. Yeah, that's dangerous. Now, now, now you're just there to do damage, like you're not really trying to do anything. That's good.

[51:27]
What's also exciting, this is the other thing about it.

[51:29]
When when you're allowed to throw fire into the lobby of the apartment building where the mayor lives and no one stops you and you're out in front and people are playing music and dancing and everyone's going Black Lives Matter, which there's excitement to that.

[51:47]
Right. Something's happening. And then when you're talking about people that are out of work, the economy's fucked.

[51:52]
No one knows what to do. Everyone's scared covid killing a certain percentage of people.

[51:57]
You can't do anything about it. There's no vaccines. There's all this tension in the air. And then you have this movement. And then this is the most exciting thing that's happening. And then for people that don't have jobs and can't go anywhere, what the fuck do you want them to do? They're going to get sucked up into that, especially if it aligns with their political ideologies that they're a left leaning person.

[52:18]
And they're like, look, we have a real chance for real revolution here and there.

[52:22]
But what they don't understand what I was talking about, Seattle, you're doing the same thing that you would hate for people to do.

[52:31]
You're taking over businesses with force. You're occupying land that you don't deserve. You're stealing buildings. You're literally occupying buildings that other people built. And then once you get there, you're establishing boundaries, you're putting up barriers.

[52:47]
You have a police force that will attack and brutally beat people up for just filming what they perceive as injustices or what they're going to put on the Internet. And then people get shot and you're calling the fucking cops, you call the police and ambulances. When people get shot, they're, you know, God damn crazy. This is it's so poorly thought out across the board. And if you do that, if you take over an area, what's to stop people from doing that to you?

[53:13]
You've already set a precedent. You've already said we could do this with force. We're going to move in with no law behind us, with no court ruling, with no reasonable discourse. We're going to move in with force and we're going to take over there with numbers and threats. And then what's going to stop someone from doing that to you? Nothing. You fuck you've already set a precedent. You've already said this is how it's done.

[53:34]
And then it's just chaos and anarchy. It just gets worse. Exactly. And the more violence and larger group will win.

[53:40]
So from a the mission of counterinsurgency, how do you fight those ideas?

[53:46]
Is stability and security right?

[53:48]
If we want to see positive change in in, you know, kind of destitute, poverty stricken areas of the country, urban areas where like, really you don't talk about systemic racism.

[54:01]
You start looking at like Detroit and Baltimore and Chicago.

[54:05]
How do you fix that? It's not fewer police officers. It's more police officers.

[54:09]
The way that you fix it is providing providing stability and security in an area so that then businesses can flourish. Capitalism drives more job opportunities, more wealth, more education, more immediately.

[54:22]
In ten years, you'll see the the transformation of a block when a when a good business comes in and good things start happening, that business can't go there if it's dangerous, if it's rioting and it's looting.

[54:35]
So if you look at every one of the cities that had serious riots in, you know, from like Rodney King, how bad those areas still are, it takes like 50, 60 years if they ever bounce back to come back from that.

[54:49]
So if you're like, yo, go Black Lives Matter, but then you're going in rioting, you are absolutely condemning yourself to more poverty.

[54:57]
And then you go and defend the police and you remove the one thing that's going to provide stability and security out in an area that will bring. In commerce that will bring in business and jobs like you're screwing yourself.

[55:09]
It's just so hard for people to see that because it's a long game. Yeah, in the short term, they want justice and they're like, no justice, no peace. And they just want to light it on fire.

[55:18]
And I understand that they're angry and I understand that sentiment. But it's no one's explaining that this is this is how this plays out. You're literally going to fuck that area.

[55:28]
Yeah. For a long time. Yeah. Yeah, it takes a lot. And a lot of money is going to be have to be spent in order to bring it back.

[55:35]
So the money is a hard thing. Insurgencies are really cheap. You know, if. If I want to ruin something, you know, it doesn't take a lot of effort for me to destroy it, for me to build and protect something that takes a lot of manpower and manpower and hours, insurgencies are also way more successful than a, you know, conventional type war, even if it's just war of ideas, not that war in a civil war.

[56:03]
Thank God we don't have, like, geographic lines that these radical groups could align themselves with because then it would be a different problem.

[56:11]
It takes not just manpower funding. You know, if you're going to flood, say, Baltimore with police officers, that's a lot of money.

[56:20]
And it would take a long time for a business to feel like it's safe and secure for them to go in there and start effecting positive change, opening more stores, more jobs, more jobs, more wealth, more wealth, more education, more education, better schools.

[56:37]
And then, boom, we have a flourishing community where people can prosper.

[56:43]
But it takes, you know, one idiot with a Molotov cocktail to bring that all crumbling down again. And you start from scratch or below scratch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's where we are. Yeah, I mean, this is a trying time for us in the weirdest of ways, because I don't think anybody anticipated everything going this far south so quickly.

[57:03]
It's not done. Oh, this is yours. Oh, my constitution. Back up, fuckers. Yeah, I got the papers. Yeah.

[57:11]
I got just how it is. And it's not for interpretation. It's just as it is.

[57:15]
Just read the words just amazing that these guys saw human nature and how it could be fucked up and how they could ruin everything so far in advance. Do you smoke cigars.

[57:26]
I don't. You don't know.

[57:27]
No, I'm a pretty straight edge person. Don't drink it all. I'll have like a glass of wine every other night. It's good for your blood. It's good for your heart, allegedly. That's what they say. Yeah, that's the extent of it. Yeah.

[57:41]
But, you know, those are like epidemiology studies. Yeah. It's like how many people have a glass of wine every other night. How are they doing. And look at them. It's not like they've proven a glass of wine. Does X or Y taste really good with milk. Taste good.

[57:54]
Yeah I like it with steak. Yeah. I'm a big fan of red meat and red wine. Yeah. It's a good combination.

[58:00]
That's the I have a big pretty liquor cabinets of nothing that I ever drink that people just give me. So when people come over I'm like yeah you can. No mushrooms, no psychedelic.

[58:09]
No I've never done anything ever hot. Nope. That might be part of your problem. I've lots of problems.

[58:15]
There's no doubt that that is on the long, dignified list.

[58:19]
I thought about it, thought about diving in.

[58:21]
And I have I've teenage daughters that no one's a freshman in college, one's a senior in high school. And, you know, if I ever thought about it and then I have an 11 month old and a five year old.

[58:34]
So do you do a lot of fucking.

[58:36]
Yeah, all of them will be through school before I ever thought about it.

[58:41]
Hmm. I get it. My dad was a narcotics officer. Oh, that's and which was funny because I had, like, intentionally just to make him mad.

[58:51]
I had friends that were drug dealers, but I would never I would never use. But I'd be around it all the time. That's interesting.

[58:58]
How did you avoid it? Um, being an athlete, being a martial artist, being a fighter? I was more into, you know, being able to beat somebody up than not.

[59:09]
What was your first martial art that you got into karate? Mark Shotokan, oh. And then I went to Japanese jujitsu after that and her Yakir jujitsu and I did that for a while, and then I ended up at the pit Hawaiian Kempo with John Hackman and Chuck in San Luis Obispo.

[59:28]
Yeah, Arroyo Grande in San Luis Obispo. Know, and then that's that my I was actually Jake Shields that brought me to the pit. Really?

[59:38]
Yeah, he showed up so I was like the big guy at the gym and grappling wrestled and so I could go in and kind of smash a lot of the people.

[59:50]
And then this kind of awkward, weird white kid comes in and just like Matt, like mops the floor with my soul.

[59:58]
And I was like, who are you? Where did you come from and what did you like? What is this is like? Well, it's like wrestling, you know, which is kind of like jujitsu and wrestling kind of put together, you know, and but, you know, then we fight. And I think I was 16 at 15, 15, 16 at this time.

[01:00:16]
Is it can we in San Luis Obispo, there's these other guys that do it, this gang, Maggie and Scott Adams and Chuck Liddell and Antonio Manuela's Cruz Gomez. And it's like. Cool, I want to go there. So I went there and got my brains bashed in for forever. Yes, that woman's an interesting character himself.

[01:00:36]
He is. He's quite a character. Yeah.

[01:00:38]
He's a great coach, though, especially back then. He invested a lot and he was old school and guys like Chuck and myself, and we needed old school.

[01:00:51]
Now, the coaches can't do or say the things that John would say back then.

[01:00:58]
And I love John now, but, you know, he was not a kind coach. Well, he's still training Glover, right?

[01:01:05]
Yeah. And then Alex Pereira's with them now as well, which I thought was very interesting.

[01:01:10]
And McGee is still in and out. Oh, yeah.

[01:01:13]
Kautz had some injuries, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think his whole career has kind of been like that. Yeah. That was a guy that was always on my radar of like I thought I might fight because when I went to Jackson's, you know, clear break separation and then he's in the pit in Utah, right?

[01:01:29]
Yeah. Yeah. But he's got to stay healthy. He's a he's he's one of those guys that almost died and came back because of drugs, and there's a few of those guys that are almost unbreakable.

[01:01:41]
They're like they they almost die and come back and then they become these insanely disciplined people. And he's one of those.

[01:01:48]
Yeah. Is that good, though, to almost die from drugs? I don't think it's good. I think whatever led him to drugs, he probably could have squashed those demons with training.

[01:01:57]
Yeah, but the problem with there's many obsessions and addictions that come from almost the same energy that could be applied to something that makes you incredibly successful.

[01:02:13]
It's these will your brain is fixated, whether it's on gambling or whatever it is, whatever these addictions are, they could ruin your life or you could decide you're going to be the baddest motherfucker that ever lived. And it's the same kind of addictions. You know, I've talked to Tyson about this. I talked to a bunch of fighters about this that have these addictive tendencies.

[01:02:36]
But those tendencies are also obsessive tendencies, which can be applied to something that is ultimately positive, like training. That's what I do. Yeah.

[01:02:44]
I have a huge I've never had any addiction to negative stuff. But I think if you looked at my life from how I train, how I shoot, how I work, how I run my company, you're like this.

[01:02:56]
This guy's a psychopath with the the disciplined regiment of of literal pain and suffering I intentionally put my body through and that's to stay productive.

[01:03:10]
And so it's all constructive. Yeah.

[01:03:12]
I always joke that if I didn't do martial arts and fight and go to the military where all of those things were encouraged, like, yeah, we want you to fight, you know, we want you to kind of be a violent badass.

[01:03:25]
I would be in prison.

[01:03:26]
You know, I'd like for sure probably a lot of people like that. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people a lot of people that are in prison that I to this day feel like if we could have got them when they were young and said, hey, listen, listen, this is the path you're on now, but this is this is a way better path you can get on.

[01:03:44]
It's fucking exciting. Yeah. And it's going to feel good. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's painful. It's hard.

[01:03:50]
It's so rewarding. That's so rewarding. Trying to convince somebody like to buy into this way of life, you know, and I think like know hard work. The all the things that you want on the far side of hard work and. Getting somebody to believe that where they have to make all these kind of small decisions, where am I, you know, waking up early, am I not going to be drinking? Am I not going to be doing drugs?

[01:04:15]
Am I going to be training?

[01:04:16]
Am I going to all of these tiny little decisions, start adding up and like the Titanic, slowly turning the boat, you know, but had they started turning the boat earlier, they wouldn't have struck an iceberg and they all wouldn't have died.

[01:04:28]
Right.

[01:04:29]
So you have to start making all these incremental adjustments and like, imagine what the Titanic would have been had it not struck the iceberg like a connection between two worlds, you know, the poverty being able to move to a new world and the rich elite being comingling.

[01:04:44]
And who knows what the world would been like had this boat not sunk and it would have only taken these small early adjustments to see the whole entire change of its course.

[01:04:55]
But the belief right here at the helm and you're telling me that to start moving to moving the boat, I got to I don't want to be like I don't need to do all the excuses are there.

[01:05:08]
But it is so rewarding to be on the far side of all that.

[01:05:12]
It's just people need to they need to know about these procrastination demons that haunt your mind and they will rob you of all possible success of everything.

[01:05:23]
They'll still everything from you. Yeah. And, you know, when people come to our our courses. The biggest thing that we're trying to impart that I'm not going in in two and a half days, I'm not going to turn somebody into a great fighter. I'm not going to turn somebody into a great shooter in two and a half days.

[01:05:40]
But what they're going to learn is they're going to learn their assets and their liabilities and they're going to learn about themself, about what do they need to do that we're going to put them on a course, a direction, a path, all the things they need to do to positively change their life.

[01:05:54]
And it becomes is this I'll use addictive like this all consuming passion to want to know that your family's safe, to not live in fear, to know that you're healthy, like I have less body fat.

[01:06:07]
I'm feeling kind of like a bad ass. I want to flirt with my wife a little bit more now.

[01:06:11]
I'm having more sex now. My energy's going up now. I'm sleeping better in the next days, even better so I can train a little bit more.

[01:06:17]
I can work a little bit more. I can shoot a little bit more.

[01:06:19]
And then like the next day, I'm even better and like just one percent incremental changes now two months removed.

[01:06:26]
Like, who is this person who just lost 20 pounds of fat? Like you got calluses on your hands. You don't have that fat baby chub on your face anymore. And more importantly, I see life in your eyes where you showed up two months ago. And there's like this ghost skeleton of a human.

[01:06:40]
Now I see a person. It's rad. Okay. And I get to see this transformation of people. It's all the favorite things about what I do.

[01:06:46]
Yeah. It's so hard for people that don't do it to understand that if you do push your body, it gets stronger and you grow and then you literally feel better. I try to explain it to a friend of mine. I said, imagine if you have a race car and the race car is 400 horsepower and a certain with tire and a certain kind of suspension. But literally you can make it have more horsepower and handle better. And all you have to do is work.

[01:07:10]
You just have to push it and the tires widen and the suspension will toughen and it'll be more more pliable around corners.

[01:07:19]
The engine will get stronger, the exhaust will sound better. It'll be more rewarding to drive. You can do this. Yeah, you can do with your body. Like your body literally is like your race car. Yes. And your mind, your mind goes along with it, which is another thing that bums me out. We're really smart.

[01:07:33]
People don't want to work out because they think it's like they think it's for meatheads or they think it's it's a stupid, egotistical pursuit.

[01:07:41]
Like, no, you literally are all connected.

[01:07:44]
Your brain and your body are one total human condition.

[01:07:48]
Yes. Just because you look, if you're an awesome pianist, right. And you're really good at playing the piano, you have to understand that that's not just your fingers.

[01:07:57]
Right. That's your mind. Your mind is also making you play the piano.

[01:08:02]
Well, guess what? If you were in better cardiovascular shape, you probably could do that even better because in the whole system would work better. Everything would work better. And this is the same with every inspiring. Yes. You know, everything everything is going quicker. You and guys like Rachmaninoff, big, huge, powerful hands.

[01:08:17]
I could play these big, huge chords like his body conditioned to be able to do those things.

[01:08:22]
It wasn't like immediately he had this one and a half octave reach. Right.

[01:08:25]
He learned and his hands literally grew to be able to play chords that if you and I go and play them right now, we have carpal tunnel in six months, you know, like his body adapted, evolved to be able to play like doh doh doh doh doh doh doh doh doh doh doh doh.

[01:08:41]
Like, it's so freaking cool. I love humans.

[01:08:43]
I love humans. To my friend Cam Haynes does a bunch of ultramarathons. Just I love that he's an awesome dude.

[01:08:50]
And he started out like, it's funny when I talk to him, like when I started running I run a mile and that's and so someone is saying, like, how the fuck does someone run 240 miles?

[01:09:00]
I go, would you start by running a mile? Yeah. How do you start eating an elephant? Yeah. You start and you just you keep and then next thing you know, you can run three miles and you could do it at a comfortable pace. And then six months later you can run six miles at a comfortable pace. And then six months after that, you can run a marathon at a comfortable pace. And then six months after that, you can run an ultramarathon.

[01:09:22]
You got, like you said, six months, though, like people.

[01:09:25]
Immediate early gratification. Right? Like, how can I just hit a button or I just watch an app or pull up a YouTube video and teach me how to do that because it takes work.

[01:09:34]
Yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, it's a thing. So how do you convince somebody to do it? Because the. This idea, this constitutional republic that we're in, like it was possible because the individuals were strong, self-sufficient, and they believed in individual responsibility.

[01:09:51]
Right. And they have fuckin balls. Yeah, the big another huge powerful.

[01:09:57]
I mean, a fight, a bear like, you know, I start a republic, start a whole new thing.

[01:10:04]
That's another possible to know without that individual being a freakin stud. Yeah, right.

[01:10:11]
And not this fat, flatulent gelatin human sitting on the couch playing video games. And none of these ideas are possible.

[01:10:23]
If we continue down this soft trajectory of wanting instant gratification and believing that we're entitled to anything we have, we have to believe that you got to be a bad ass for this to work.

[01:10:35]
There's so many people that are conditioned to instant gratification and there's so many people that just want to take a pill. That's that's that's another problem today. You know, you feel bad, you feel bad.

[01:10:43]
We need to take a pill or or go run for miles. Yeah. And do what your brain does the same frickin thing that your pill just made your do.

[01:10:52]
But it happened naturally and you'll be healthier and you're going to produce more of it tomorrow.

[01:10:56]
Yeah. Yeah, you know, like I don't know a lot of really depressed, frustrated, sad, healthy, smart people who exercise a lot.

[01:11:07]
Yeah, yeah. No, it's not. I mean, I'm sure there's some I'm sure there are absolutely some mental imbalance is just like some people have liver disease. Right. And they don't even drink. Some people they get cancer and they didn't do anything wrong because the body fucks up. Sometimes that also happens with your brain. It happens with hormones. It happens with your your brain's ability to produce dopamine, serotonin. Sometimes it just doesn't work right now.

[01:11:30]
And that is that is a real thing. But more often than not, that's not what's going on.

[01:11:35]
Now, just go do the work. Just go do the work. Yeah, I feel so good and everything. Like, how much do you love eating your. OK, I love it. It's not only does it taste fantastic, right.

[01:11:44]
Not only do you look at it and remember every time I'm cooking, whether like I have lasagna, the other night it took some elk, made Italian sausage, a little bit of pork fat, bunch of Italian, you know, oregano and time there were mixed into the meat.

[01:11:58]
So I made a lasagna with ground backstrap and Italian sausage two nights ago.

[01:12:05]
But the like as I'm cooking and I'm remembering walking up this mountain and seeing it two ridges away and be like, OK, where's the wind coming from? How am I going to buttonhook around this thing so I can stay up wind of it and catch it in this next ravine, you know, and like every single moment, the smells and it's all coming back to you.

[01:12:24]
And I sit down the table, I my family with me, and we're going to eat this together.

[01:12:29]
It's amazing. It's like magical. It's hard for people to understand that I've never done it before, but it is eating something that you have hunted and killed yourself is a different thing. It's a different thing.

[01:12:39]
Really is. Yeah. So fun, though, in Texas. Boy, what a good place to do it.

[01:12:44]
Do it anywhere here. There's so many ranches here.

[01:12:47]
It's so much like there's not a public land. So it's going be a little bit differently. Two percent. Yeah.

[01:12:51]
Which is state which is kind of bonkers. Yeah. But I mean is the government really supposed to be owning our land.

[01:12:57]
Well you just got all Texas on me. Yeah. Yeah. It was.

[01:13:02]
I'm not opposed to owning property and you can pay to hunt all these places and most of these places are a lot of them I should say, our commercial hunting ranches, and they're not unreasonable. And you can go and for a small amount of money, when you think about the amount of animal that you get, I mean, if you.

[01:13:20]
Hundreds of pounds. Yeah.

[01:13:21]
And especially pigs like you get some wild first of all, wild pigs. You've eaten wild pigs. Yeah, I fucking love them. I think they're goddamn delicious.

[01:13:30]
I love them. You got to get the right one. You got to get the right way.

[01:13:32]
Well I've got I got lucky. And the ones that I've hunted have been at to Hone Ranch in California and they eat a lot of acorns and they were real thick with fat.

[01:13:41]
Oh my God. So good a shot. One with John Dudley and we brined it and slow cooked it on the trigger. It was incredible. I love right here. Oh, I love it.

[01:13:51]
So that's the thing. Yeah. I had this walk in. I mean, it's half the size of the studio, this walk in smoker. And it had the heating element and the smoke elements and had it kind of like insulated. It was like I could hang an entire rack of ribs in there, but I had to sit there.

[01:14:11]
24/7, for however long I was going to sit there and smoke this and just too much adjusting smoke levels and heat levels and and then it's like, oh, now I can just put this thing in my head and walk inside with my phone.

[01:14:25]
It's going to cost me hey, add add some more stuff in here. Yeah.

[01:14:30]
I need more smoke and like I got to do even better.

[01:14:33]
I love when you do a recipe through the app. The app actually navigates the cooking cycle and changes temperature for you. But then at the end of the day it's really just fire and wood. That's the beautiful thing.

[01:14:43]
There's no chemicals, there's no gas. There's it's just fire and wood.

[01:14:48]
So it tastes like you cooked it over an open fire.

[01:14:50]
So again, it's fucking awesome. And wild game that way is the best. It's the best. I mean, there's a reason why so many hunters buy Trager's pellet grills. Any peligro, if you know, trigger grills are the shit they're so good like.

[01:15:05]
I love how easy it makes life, you know, like my my outdoor kitchens next to the pool. So I go throw that stuff in there and I'm like in the pool with the kids.

[01:15:14]
Yeah, mine too. And it's just yeah, I'm not sitting over there wasting my whole entire day and my kids are pissed. You know, I like you better appreciate this brisket because I spent 14 hours on it, you know, like that never happens.

[01:15:25]
Like I put it in there and I got it. Old school. Like when I watch the videos of Franklyn's Franklin's barbecue in Austin, that dude, he uses old school, you know, offset smokers with wood and throws the wood in with the logs. And obviously the result is fucking insanely delicious.

[01:15:40]
I appreciate it, but I don't have time for that.

[01:15:42]
But that's his full time job. Well, Aaron Franklin, I got it. That's amazing doing that thing. I'll drive in and buy it when I need it, but I don't have the time to do that.

[01:15:50]
And I love looking at my app like all the meats at 120 degrees.

[01:15:54]
Get ready to pull it out. I'm getting close and sends, you know, a little notification. Hmm. Yeah. No, I love it. I love it. And I can't get enough wild game and I need to bring more out here. I didn't bring enough out here. I have I have it in commercial freezers, some of it back home. So I literally might take a trip back home just to fill up some coolers and bring meat back.

[01:16:13]
It's crazy shipping it with dry ice. Well, if I was put in a yeti, yeah, if it's frozen, it'll you could send it regular ground mail for five days, it'll get there fucking frozen. That's it's crazy how well those things keep temperature.

[01:16:30]
I put on either end a little cardboard vertical separator from the meat and then I pack dry ice in there and I just leave like an inch along the top if I'm shipping stuff.

[01:16:43]
And then it just keeps it, you know, super frozen.

[01:16:46]
For how long? How long the last of the dry ice, you know, evaporates at the same weather regardless of temperature. So inside there, that'll last for five days.

[01:16:55]
Well, yeah. Yeah, it's it can be done. Yeah. You could ship it. What are you guys doing tomorrow, 9/11. Well, the reason why I had you on here today is because this podcast can be released on 9/11. I think there's no more appropriate person to have on 9/11 than you.

[01:17:10]
We have a podcast tomorrow that we're doing a Skype, one with a fellow from the U.K. The there are way more appropriate people than me, like any firefighter that was there at Ground Zero.

[01:17:23]
Have you been to ground zero? No, man, you've got to go. Every American.

[01:17:28]
I think New York City is off my list for life now.

[01:17:30]
Yes, that's a good point. But being there and sitting by the way, if you live in New York, relax.

[01:17:37]
I'm coming back.

[01:17:39]
I they do a ton of comedy there. Yeah. They're still doing comedy there. You have to do it outside, though, in a fucking tent.

[01:17:44]
Yeah, but don't people come by with microphones and scream at you. Yeah.

[01:17:47]
That's comedy too. I don't know John. How come.

[01:17:52]
And I talked this week, he called me like, hey, what would you do if you're at a restaurant and you know, you're essentially ambushed by people screaming at you, trying, you know, telling you to raise your to raise your fist and like, you know, want to not be there because I'd before I go places, I'm making sure that it's safer to go there.

[01:18:14]
You know, I'm not going to be sitting at a restaurant where a protest is can be walking through.

[01:18:19]
And I know they are targeting ones specifically to try to catch people and get the I gotcha moment, too, is like, you know, situational awareness.

[01:18:27]
It's not I'm sitting here and I see some people congregating across the street. I'm going to wait and see what happens.

[01:18:32]
Now, there's a lot of people I see cameras, I see megaphones. I can still sit here and wait and see what happens. Like, I actually like five or six people wearing black hoodies, masks, you know, little red fists painted on their shoulders. And like that dinner's done.

[01:18:45]
We're out of here and we pack up and go, yes, New York, crazy, crazy place. But that that memorial is I don't know what it is about that place.

[01:18:56]
Like you can feel our souls like you can feel the pain there.

[01:19:03]
I think that's real. I think you can. My dad went to Gettysburg and my stepfather and he was there and he said, I've never believed that there's a place where you could feel sadness. He goes, but you just feel the people that died there that feel it.

[01:19:18]
I mean, a palatable, describable heaviness. Yeah. And this is not like I'm not like I'm not a guy that, you know, Krystal's know. But you can feel it and you never forget.

[01:19:32]
Right. How quickly we forgot.

[01:19:35]
Well, they were trying to cancel the fuckin putting up the lights. Yeah. Yeah. Like why why would you do that. Have you seen the Falling Man documentary. No.

[01:19:44]
So there's a photograph called The Falling Man that it is.

[01:19:50]
Now, you could just Google falling man and you see this guy and this any time. I need to know the reason why I'm going all over these places doing that.

[01:20:01]
Dude, if I look at it because, like, I mean, it gets me because I get to talk about this dude for a second.

[01:20:10]
He's sitting, standing, kneeling, laying on the floor of a shattered window.

[01:20:16]
And he's looking back inside and he's making the decision whether he's going to burn alive or he's going to jump to his death. Him and hundreds others, they're sitting there, Americans looking inside of a building, being like, OK.

[01:20:30]
Do I burn alive? Or do I jump to my death and now that that video and that picture is so unnerving because he consciously is making the choice to die the whole entire way down, you can see he's staying in like I'm going to face plant into the asphalt and all the way into the ground.

[01:20:50]
He's making that choice because he didn't want to burn alive.

[01:20:54]
So, like, every time I'm stuck in or suffering or frustrated, if I have to go, you know, do another mission that I'm of course, I want to do all these sexy things all over the planet. And but sometimes, like, I don't usually that's the way the military works.

[01:21:06]
Don't get to pick and.

[01:21:09]
I think about that guy and I think about the 3000 Americans that were standing there and be faced with that choice of am I going to burn alive or am I going to jump to my death because insurgents wanting to, you know, radical fundamentals wanted to destroy the idea that we stood for capitalism, American freedom, you know, with 500000 dollars and box cutters, these untrained assholes, we're able to bring down the largest superpower on the planet.

[01:21:42]
That's what asymmetrical warfare is like.

[01:21:44]
Asymmetrical is is something that's not aligned with everything else. And warfare in these. Under asymmetric warfare is kind of haves not fighting the haves and doing it in ways that nobody's ever done it before, it was it was genius and horrible that this small group of untrained guys with box cutters did.

[01:22:04]
But how many trillions of dollars have we spent in this war? 17 billion dollars in damage just in that one day, 3000 American lives, more lives since Pearl Harbor.

[01:22:15]
You know, like we went to war with the Japanese and dropped two atomic bombs for that. We're so short.

[01:22:23]
With what we remember. This just current society's generation is fast influx of information like I want to never forget that man's face and do we know who he was?

[01:22:37]
Yeah. Yeah, they think they're like 90 percent. There was another couple that did it as well.

[01:22:47]
There is like a few dozen. I got the girl on the right. Or maybe she's white and covered in soot, but she's literally looking down, trying to get a breath of fresh breath of air before she either suffocates or burns alive.

[01:23:07]
And then she jumps. I never again we say never forget and never again, like, how do we stop that? And that is the constant.

[01:23:23]
Unrelenting fight against these fanatic ideas, and it's not just there are countless types of of revolutionaries and insurgents like ones that do it for religious reasons, ones to push out foreign powers, ones because of the the Hutu and Tutsi like that's just ethnic, but they're all the same kind of formula of we're not happy about something.

[01:23:50]
So we're going to do something horrific to try and change asymmetrical warfare, to try to change the shape of something and.

[01:24:00]
That fight against this, these extreme outliers, has to be one that we're committed to all the time, otherwise that will happen again.

[01:24:10]
It might be a train, it might be a bus, you know, it might be a dirty bomb, you know, thank God Boston probably the worst thing that's happened since then, which was a couple of idiots with pressure cookers because we have been so aggressive, not just here, but also abroad, ensuring that this doesn't happen.

[01:24:31]
It's weird right now, you know, I think the last time I was here, I was telling you how bad it is and special operations and special forces specifically in recruiting like we are hurting for people and the right people and all the people that have been coming in.

[01:24:43]
They came in to fight this war. But now we have kids in basic training that weren't alive when 9/11 happened.

[01:24:50]
I volunteered on 9/11 because of this, but now we have I don't even know how many I'm calling them kids, they're heroes that they're there selflessly serving their country.

[01:25:02]
But we're leaving Iraq. We're leaving Afghanistan.

[01:25:05]
I had a deployment next year that looks like it's going to get kinked because Trump is pulling back our forces from these places for us to do other things.

[01:25:13]
And those other things are counterinsurgency.

[01:25:17]
It's foreign internal defense. It's security forces assistance. It's joint combined exercises for training.

[01:25:22]
And like while I want to go put on my body armor and have a beard and go look sexy and go do all these things, those are the important jobs that we have to do in the coming in the coming years to make sure this doesn't happen again.

[01:25:33]
Right.

[01:25:33]
If we're in Afghanistan in 1999 with a presence trying to help the Afghani government. We have a constitutional republic or a government, in a way, would have this happened. Maybe not. I don't know, but probably not the same reason why we're all over Africa. Same reason why we still have presence in NATO. It's the same reason that we're were present in the Philippines.

[01:25:59]
It's trying to fight these radical ideas so that security and stability provides an area for people to live freely however they want to.

[01:26:08]
We're not telling anybody how to live right. Philippines, Africa, Niger, Nigeria, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, you guys do your things. Whatever that thing is.

[01:26:17]
We're here to help you do it. But it's going to be done safely to provide stability and security. So I never want to see that again. Like, do you want to see an American me? Like I'm going to see my kids, but I want to burn alive somewhere, Jhumpa. Fuck you and your extremist ideas, I will find you and we're gonna fight you till the day we die, but we have to be vigilant about it.

[01:26:41]
When you hear people talk about defunding the military, when you hear people talk about pulling troops out of other countries and a non-interventionist foreign policy. But you know what you know. Yeah. And you know why this stuff has to be done. How do you react to that? It's ignorance, I mean, first it's pity, it's like I feel bad for them.

[01:27:06]
You know, I'll go to a country in West Africa and I'll go back two years later and I will see the school that I helped build or was providing training for the people that are going to be protecting it.

[01:27:19]
And that school still functioning and they've had two years of people graduating from that school.

[01:27:24]
And now I go to what was like this podunk village and people are sitting there reading a book like you can read, I can learn how to read last year what this is so cool.

[01:27:35]
You know, like you have fresh water. How did you have fresh water? Like, oh, well, we learned how to read and then we started reading these books and we actually do natural filtration through the soil.

[01:27:46]
And we're also doing this tiered irrigation, like check out our crops, like, holy crap, you have crops here.

[01:27:53]
You can have crops here two years ago, like in in two in two years, I'm seeing this transformation of people.

[01:28:01]
So every single radical group from ISIS, al-Qaida, Taliban, FAQ to Antifa, they go and target the poor and uneducated.

[01:28:16]
That's that's who they recruit from. And they take these ideas.

[01:28:20]
They plant seeds and they plant seeds through like you're super poor, your daughter's going to get married. I'm going to come in as the bad guy, as the ISIS member.

[01:28:29]
And I'm going to pay for your daughter's wedding. And and the endowment ahmadu at all and now would like you're indebted to me and your wife and her new husband are kind of like appreciative to me. But now I have a hook in you and I can. And it doesn't take a lot of money to pay for a wedding in. Somalia. So that there's the population, there's the poverty, and there's the opportunity for them to plant these seeds of Phanatic.

[01:29:03]
Ridiculousness, and that's that's what they do. So when I see somebody that's like, hey, we need to pull everybody back. Yeah, in. In wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we we have created stability there, and I don't know what we can never govern Afghanistan like they can't be.

[01:29:23]
That's just the way that the people are. And it's kind of cool. And it's kind of also frightening because they're so nomadic.

[01:29:29]
Yes. I mean, it's been tribals forever.

[01:29:32]
I mean, you go back to Genghis Khan, you know, like they've been insurgents from corn to to the British to the Russians to the British again to the French to then the Russians again, then to us.

[01:29:46]
Like, they've just been doing this thing for as long as they've been in existence, so.

[01:29:53]
Just leave them be right, we can still be there with the government like hand in hand, advise and assist in a company like how to do things. But we don't physically need to be there fighting wars all the time.

[01:30:05]
And that's kind of what we're doing, right. We're phasing back our physical direct action presence.

[01:30:12]
But it's somebody saying that we need to pull everybody in. We only need to protect our own borders. And let's just be present here. It's super naive and it's super ignorant because this is the result of us not being outside of our own borders.

[01:30:26]
The idea of policing the world doesn't sit well with people, though. They don't have to police the idea, the world.

[01:30:32]
And that's not what we're doing. It's the security forces assistance or joint combined exercise for training or for internal defence.

[01:30:38]
That is, I am not walking around being like, hey, you insurgent, you get back in that building I'm with, like by, with and through working with the local government, by their side, with them, with their mission and their intent through their own purpose and ideas.

[01:30:56]
I understand that. But how do you get that message to people that do think that it's policing the world, that do think that we should mind our own business and take that Ron Paul approach and pull the troops back and take care of our own and not worry about other countries?

[01:31:12]
I mean, I wish I could take people with me to show them.

[01:31:17]
Have you ever listen to Ron Paul talk about this? Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I think the easy answer, and I never like easy answers, is that this hasn't happened, 9/11 hasn't happened again, even though they have we know that they have tried.

[01:31:33]
10000 times they've tried to do this again in every single way, and whether it's a terrorist training camp where we got them, whether it's the new ISIS leader, whether it's the new al-Qaida leader, whether it's the next Iranian, you know, Secret Service that's funding groups and terrorist organizations all over the planet, we got him, you know, like we have been constant and vigilant in in finding them and stopping them.

[01:32:02]
And we have to do otherwise. But how is how is this not happened again? Are there fewer extremists?

[01:32:08]
No. We have stopped them through our actions, if we did not do anything, this would happen again. How much of an effect does it have in who's president? Oh man, a lot. Like, what was the difference between Obama and Trump?

[01:32:27]
I'll just use ammo as an example, a soup again, not an easy I'm just trying to draw, you know, parallels.

[01:32:37]
That people can wrap their heads around, if I'm going to forecast how much ammo I need for training, I'm going to find out what my mission is. I'm going to set up kind of like the training calendar of all the events that we're going to do, flat ranges to be long distance sniper stuff, mounted training, and then that forecasts how much I need. And then I go and I ask for that ammo and I would get like.

[01:33:04]
I'd be allowed to ask for about a third then during Obama of what I was allowed to ask for with Bush or now Trump a third.

[01:33:14]
A third. Wow, yeah. Is there rationalization for that? It's just like.

[01:33:21]
A funding like us being able to buy cool drones or new guns or different optics like the funding is there or the funding is not there, and if like while the big department Defense military machine may not be the most efficient thing when it goes down to the individual, like it comes down to me being like, I can have this gun or I can't I can't have this Opdyke or I can't have to use this old rifle that's been shot by 20 soldiers before me or I get a new one.

[01:33:55]
And and it's it's black and white. It's like dollars and cents. Like I have nine dollars under this guy or I have three dollars under this guy.

[01:34:04]
So when you left fighting and went back into the military was one of the reasons you did that, because Trump was in office and then there was more funding.

[01:34:13]
Yes. I don't like losing at anything and going into a fight that you are not prepared to win is a pretty bad idea.

[01:34:28]
And knowing you like Kelvin Gastelum as an example, suppose to fight Richard Evans at New Year's Eve. All right. Madison Square Garden in November and fell through medical things.

[01:34:44]
And I mean, by the time I get to Kelvin Gastelum, I've cut my weight two different times now. My ballooned up to 220, back down to 145, 220. Now I'm cutting weight back to 185 again and now a five month fight camp.

[01:34:57]
I like walking out to the octagon tired, like I just warmed up in the back with Brandon and Greg.

[01:35:03]
And I'm like, that's a real trend. Yeah, but a bad feeling to walk into a fight. Not in a position to fight, and we are when Trump was elected, we were 100 percent still at war. ISIS was thriving. All the places they went and fought in Afghanistan were now controlled by ISIS. Like, you know, bad.

[01:35:27]
That sucks to look at all the places where I remember friends getting hurt or, you know, like JoCo, the places that he went duck, those were occupied by ISIS physically occupy.

[01:35:37]
Then he lost countless friends Fallujah, Ramadi, Sadr City, all of those places, all in the Syrian border controlled by ISIS land that we controlled and fought and then lost and then thinking about like, I have to go back in here and do this again.

[01:35:50]
But I have the third a third amount of the resources to do it.

[01:35:54]
That sucks. Or knowing that, OK, now and have a guy that is going to back me with a pocketbook to go and win, not that was the the choice for me was I just want to win.

[01:36:11]
I don't want 9/11 to happen again. And that's hard to stop when you're giving. When you're creating vacuums for evil to fill in, how much of an impact has it have? Has it had having Trump as president and making those decisions to fund the military better in terms of success overseas?

[01:36:31]
I mean, we smashed ISIS in a year, one year they rose for three and and started gaining ground. That ISIS call fits into all of the Middle East like they were popping up people swearing allegiance to ISIS in Africa.

[01:36:47]
You know, like a Boko Haram is like, yeah, we're ISIS now, like, what are you kidding me? And that cancerous plague spreading all over the world because we weren't aggressively. With vigilance, fighting those ideas, then, you know, November rolls around 2016, and it was by February of 2017, it was like go and it was off.

[01:37:15]
You know, we're literally smashing them at every single opportunity, dropping the biggest bomb, you know, in Taliban, the JDAM or the was it the MOAB?

[01:37:24]
Yeah, that's pretty cool. I just dropped the bill, the bomb next to the size of the nuclear weapon. That's that's awesome.

[01:37:34]
And this is all because of Trump getting into office and funding the military.

[01:37:39]
Yeah.

[01:37:40]
So the president comes out with this national strategic plan and that goes to a bunch of different things from Department of Defense to Department of State and every single one of these look to that idea, that document as to how they're going to operate.

[01:37:57]
And then you have the appointees to those positions, like Mattis, for example, where then he interprets what the intent is from like the executive plan and then for Department of Defense, how are we going to fulfill that?

[01:38:11]
And then that goes to all of the regional commanders and all the special operations units. And then missions are built off of fulfilling these ideas.

[01:38:20]
And those ideas were smash ISIS, remove radical terrorists off the planet and provide security and stability with all of our partners and then grow who our partners are.

[01:38:33]
So like in Africa, if you went back five, six years, you would have.

[01:38:41]
Three or four or five countries that were part of this, like this group of regional Africans wanting to be free, like they don't want Boko Haram or al-Qaida or ISIS coming in and telling them what to do.

[01:38:57]
They want a free constitutional government. So we started helping.

[01:39:01]
Now there's like a dozen of those countries that are part of this group and they're all doing they're all doing the work. And it's amazing. It's amazing to see what happens in just a couple of years. And any one of these countries, when they start doing the work, it's no different. Their person. Right. It's like but it's a group of people and they're all believing in these ideas of freedom, of education, of prosperity. And we're just creating an opportunity for those to be realized.

[01:39:31]
This is not a message that gets out enough.

[01:39:35]
What you're saying right now about the importance of funding the military, about all the positive aspects of these operations and about how squashing these fundamentalist terrorist groups can lead to democracy in all these places and can lead to flourishing schools and growth of these individual areas.

[01:39:55]
Yeah, this is not a message that gets out enough.

[01:39:57]
No, and that's by design a little bit, I think. You know, half the country doesn't want the other half to look good, and we definitely know that are all of our enemies, foreign enemies are 100 percent participating right now as we move toward November in delegitimizing what this country stands for, in the process of our elections and what we're allowed to do successfully overseas. So like, you know, from Russia to China, like their.

[01:40:29]
In the business of hurting America, and they're not only here like making our election seem unfair or broken, but also abroad where they're trying to like every place that we are, they are as well.

[01:40:49]
And they are trying to do the opposite of what we like. They want radicals.

[01:40:53]
They want broken. They want because every little bit that they do is more that we have to fight against.

[01:41:01]
I said that an insurgency is cheap and a counterinsurgency is expensive, but we're fighting counter-insurgency all over the planet as we move towards the elections.

[01:41:13]
With Portland firing off, Seattle firing off, I think would be very naive for us not to think that China and Russia are negatively participating.

[01:41:23]
If you look at 2016 with Hillary and Trump or the Russians involved.

[01:41:29]
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

[01:41:32]
They're. Stoking the fires of hate on both sides, and it didn't matter who won, like they didn't want Trump to win, they didn't need Hillary to win.

[01:41:41]
They just need the process to look broken. They just have to make us look bad. It doesn't matter to them who wins.

[01:41:46]
And coming to Biden and Trump, it doesn't matter who wins.

[01:41:51]
It matters that they do legitimize the process of a fair election and a constitutional republic. It's really easy to do.

[01:42:02]
I'm going to use all right, you have a birthday coming up, you are going to turn 60. Happy birthday. You look great for being 60.

[01:42:10]
And you're going to have a party to celebrate this. And you're going to have all your friends over.

[01:42:17]
You know, you got some gay guys, you got some black guys, you got some Mexicans.

[01:42:21]
You got you're pretty balanced person with lots of different friends from lots of different cultures.

[01:42:26]
Not but they're all going to be in the same room. Right. Got this big, huge melting pot of your party. Cool. It's going to be a rad party.

[01:42:33]
You got a bar you kind of rented this cool place has, you know, some few bathrooms, has this nice, nice balcony, this beautiful statue.

[01:42:43]
And there is like this ice sculpture that's there's some great drinks on it and the punch is underneath it.

[01:42:52]
I don't want to have a good party, I'm your insurgent, I don't like you, I don't like your ideas.

[01:42:57]
I don't like this idea of everybody being able to commingle.

[01:43:01]
So I'm going to go on I'm going to ruin your party. I had a friend of a friend that kind of got me in.

[01:43:05]
So how hard is it for me to ruin your party? Super easy, right? I could go piss in the punch. I could go find that gay guy using homophobic slurs. I could find that that Muslim over in the corner and, you know, tell him that like the PLO is the dumbest group on the planet, you know, that Israel should own everything and that, you know, Muslims are ignorant, multi wife assholes.

[01:43:28]
All of it's untrue. It doesn't matter if I believe it. I'm just there to piss people off. I'm going to go to those two bathrooms. I'm a go give you an upper decker. I'm gonna go poop in the top of two of those toilets.

[01:43:37]
Well, that's disgusting, right?

[01:43:38]
Stinks. Maybe I'm to go chip away at the that little beautiful sculpture.

[01:43:44]
So when somebody goes to scoop that their first punch, the whole thing topples over so easy and so cheap for me to ruin everything about your day. That's what they're trying to do, an election. Right. They're just trying to erode the process and ruin it. And it cost them nothing to go and piss off every single group, the far right, the far left. They just want people angry.

[01:44:06]
And the process is so simple now with Twitter and Instagram and Facebook. All right.

[01:44:10]
This step, these these massive bots that can go in like things and create and they play this long game where they just start planting seeds of distrust and and.

[01:44:23]
They are spending money to make antifa mad, they're spending money to make the boogaloo brose look mad and they want everybody to be mad at everybody moving into November.

[01:44:35]
So then the process, the election is jacked, but your party, so you do have an option. This is the catch 22 of how difficult it is as a leader to stop it.

[01:44:47]
Like I could hire security guards, I could put a guard at the front, I could have put a guard by the punch. I could put a guard in every bathroom.

[01:44:54]
I could check all the IDs of everybody coming in.

[01:44:57]
I could have like a exact list of people that are allowed to attend.

[01:45:02]
But now I just ruined you just ruined your own party because you're trying to provide security and stability and you put all of that in there.

[01:45:10]
And but now your party sucks, like I can't get a drink. I'm only allowed one drink and nobody's allowed to talk to each other and nobody's allowed to hang out. Everybody has to be segregated in separate.

[01:45:20]
So you ruin your own party.

[01:45:21]
So in either case, you give me freedom of movement the American way and I'm going to ruin it. Or you try to come in too heavy handed and then you look like a dictator.

[01:45:31]
You know, you look like Hitler himself.

[01:45:35]
So how do you how do you have a good party, it's hard. That's where we're at right now. They're literally doing that with with every way they can. It's frightening.

[01:45:47]
So this idea that Russia just wants Trump to win, it's horseshit. Yeah, they don't care. They just need the process to look bad. So we have a constitutional republic, right.

[01:45:58]
What do they have? For a dictatorship. Absolutely, so they don't need. A friend, they just needed the process, the idea of America to look broken. That's what that's success to them.

[01:46:15]
If I like, I can say this with such absolute conviction, because this is what we do. This is what we do. This is what we go overseas and do.

[01:46:25]
Like we have specific groups that are doing this exact thing to make them look bad, but they're doing it to us.

[01:46:30]
And because America is so free, it's so much easier to do here.

[01:46:36]
How hard is it for me to go to Russia and or land in China and go and start planting seeds of discontent, pretty freaking hard, right? Like here, it's not.

[01:46:47]
Hmm. So hard to fight this, so because of the fact that we have freedom, because of the fact that we have these democratic elections, because of the fact that we have the ability to express ourselves and communicate freely online, which they don't really have in either one of those countries. I mean, there's severe repercussions for criticizing the government in China. Yeah, severe and same thing about Russia. So because we have this freedom over here, they participate.

[01:47:15]
Yeah. And the way they participate is through the Internet research agency. And I had a woman on named Renee Turistas who extensively researched this and was talking about how spectacular this operation was and what they would do. The literally organized a pro Texas meetup across the street from a pro Muslim meetup. And they set it up. They set it up that way. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:47:37]
A friend who's very well versed online found this antifa rage, this thing against white rage online. And they they traced the IP back to Russia. Yeah. And they're like, this is wild. This is wild shit.

[01:47:52]
Like, there's not wild, though, in America. Well, yeah. America, wake up your eyes because I wake up and open your eyes to this is happening where how naive is it for us not to think that our enemies are trying to negatively affect what is happening here?

[01:48:09]
Right.

[01:48:10]
Because this is the place where you can negatively affect it in the way that they can do it here, which is different than the way you can affect anything in Russia or China because of the fact that we have this freedom of expression.

[01:48:20]
Yeah, they don't they don't need somebody to win. They just have to make us look bad.

[01:48:24]
This is where our medias failed us because our media takes this horrible partisan position, whether you're on the left or the right, they they only want to look at the things that show that the left or the right, depending on who your enemy is, is fucking up and how China or Russia, whoever whoever you deem the player that's the key player is influencing our elections because they want this person to win. So if you love America, you will vote against Trump because the Russians want Trump to win.

[01:48:52]
This is this is the fucking narrative that keeps getting spit out at us. And it's not it doesn't sit well with me.

[01:48:58]
And I'm glad you're explaining it the way you're explaining it, because partisanship and this this inability to look at things objectively is really fucking us up. Yeah, it's really bad. And these motherfuckers that are running the media, there's a reason why people aren't paying attention anymore. There's a reason.

[01:49:14]
There's a reason why those those sources are not trusted.

[01:49:19]
Divided is perfectly divided. Like if I if I were in China or in Moscow, I was like, exactly what kind of environment do I want?

[01:49:31]
So I could negatively affect an election. You're looking at it, right? Yeah.

[01:49:37]
I'm going to stoke the fires of the one percent on the right. I'm a stoke. The fires are the one percent on the left. And I'm just going to I want them so angry. I've created all these different accounts that have thousands of followers. They're fake. The followers are bots and the people that are saying that those are real people that speak perfect English and they are in there in those groups just planting hate.

[01:49:57]
So people just get madder and madder and madder. You know, we look at like Black Lives Matter.

[01:50:03]
I don't think there's a single American that that's going to be like now black lives don't matter.

[01:50:07]
There might be one. But screw that racist, right? So few and so irrelevant. It's such a minor position. Yeah.

[01:50:14]
Like like is there solidarity for sure. Like are the solutions, the things being talked about.

[01:50:22]
Not really, not really.

[01:50:23]
Why is that like I'm spending probably half of my waking hours right now developing a way to be able to train police officers and get something in every single police department so they can like, you know, unconscious bias training about how to de-escalate understanding different cultures.

[01:50:42]
Right. If I'm walking down the street and I see a Sikh and I'm like, oh, is this a Muslim? I've got to go here and fight this guy.

[01:50:47]
The guy comes in a little bit close because that's part of their culture and part of their culture. They have a knife and I don't know any of this.

[01:50:53]
And I just misunderstood who this person is and his religion and his ethnicity. And now I had this super bad interaction because this guy stepped into my space and all that could have been trained out.

[01:51:04]
I could have taught somebody those things.

[01:51:07]
And with everybody being so stoked on getting angry and finding out the problems, nobody's talking about solutions like how do we how do we if there's a problem in law enforcement and there is like, how do we fix that?

[01:51:22]
Can we talk about that instead of of trying to find the the next poor Uber driver that gets lost immediately, calling him a racist or finding the next Antifa guy that is really just poor, lost his job, has been living in his mom's basement and just needs something to do, you know, let's give them something to do.

[01:51:42]
And that's like make a positive impact.

[01:51:44]
That is a real part of what's going on, too. Yeah, it's a real part of what's going on. People don't feel like they belong. And when there's a movement going on, if you jump on that, you see that guy who shot the pro Trump supporter in Portland. Yeah. And you see the interview with him afterwards. Yeah. The interview is classic. You listen to him interviewed him. He's a lost guy, a lost, weird social outcast who found a home and then is soaking up all this attention that he got for shooting a Trump supporter he's claiming was out there trying to kill a friend of his of color, his description of it, and then the police show up and he tries to shoot them.

[01:52:20]
Yeah, he's just a lost person, a violent, lost person.

[01:52:24]
I mean, somebody with a lot with no purpose.

[01:52:25]
Right, is a dangerous thing, especially one who doesn't understand the consequences of their actions. Yeah.

[01:52:36]
My my brother's a sheriff Nick in in California, and the things that he has to do in a day, you know, the number of people and interactions that he has to have that he has had in his career and every single time, is it going to be this Antifa guy that just shot somebody in Monterey?

[01:52:58]
There was actually some Antifa guys that had thrown some pipe bombs in Oakland and then drove into northern Monterey County and set off some more pipe bombs, shot a couple more cops.

[01:53:10]
And this kind of got buried in the news. But my brother was one of the guys that showed up there.

[01:53:15]
And they have to deal with that like a radical domestic terrorist. And they also have to show up when a husband and wife are having a dispute, they have to walk up to every single car as if that person is going to kill them. That person might be a DUI. That person may not want to if they have broken the law, not want to get out of the car.

[01:53:34]
I'm going to make me out of the car like it is the hardest job in the world.

[01:53:37]
They're undertrained, they're underfunded, and but they are the necessary security for us to prosper and be successful. And my brother is the most selfless, incredible person as as most of the guys. And I train with a ton of law enforcement.

[01:53:52]
And nobody they're not perfect. Nobody is. No human is.

[01:53:56]
But you can you can't train perfection, but you can train bad out of people.

[01:54:01]
And that's one of the many reasons why I think training so paramount and, you know, to the election and people are always focusing on the bad. Like, you got to find solutions.

[01:54:14]
If you're if you're mad and you believe in Black Lives Matter, what is your solution?

[01:54:19]
All right, if you're if you think the cops have a problem, like.

[01:54:24]
I'm trying to find I found a solution, we're creating this this virtual reality headset that we're going to be able to put into every single police department where they'll be able to listen to and interact with different ethnicities that that are consistent with the populations that they work in, the, you know, be able to identify unconscious bias.

[01:54:44]
Like, I'm pretty aware of the biases that I have because I look through the lens of my life through pretty jaded glasses.

[01:54:52]
Right. The things that I've gone and done and seen. But there's no way that I'm aware of all of them.

[01:54:59]
But there are ways that you could train that out of people and that you can show them and explore. We have some of the best, brightest minds, PhDs, law enforcement trainers that are designing these things that we can like, put specular theories.

[01:55:14]
My partner in this, we can take these things and send to every single law and law enforcement department and train people about how to interact. And when you're a hammer and everything looks like a nail and you're going to all of these different interactions with like, is this guy going to shoot me?

[01:55:30]
It's hard because he might, but he also might be having a bad day and he didn't know how to de-escalate that. And but you also have to be able to enforce the law. And that's the hardest thing is right now.

[01:55:42]
And I know the Chinese and the Russians are loving the fact that the we are questioning do laws really matter?

[01:55:51]
Can we just let things go?

[01:55:53]
Can we just tear down statues, can you just walk out into the middle of an interstate and stop traffic because you believe you have the right to do that?

[01:56:03]
No, you can't do that.

[01:56:05]
Like the rule of law is, they're not just for you, but it's for us.

[01:56:11]
And if you believe in the collective, then you have to believe that those laws are there for our good and we have to make sure we elect good guys that put in good laws.

[01:56:19]
But like, if you just don't believe that it matters and you can go and you can riot and you can loot and it's just property like you can burn that building down.

[01:56:28]
It's just property lives are more important than property, but there are people's lives that are attached to that property.

[01:56:34]
It might be how they make their money. It might be where they live, like watching Antifa throw those Molotov cocktails while they were kids sleeping upstairs in the apartment building. Like, shame on you. You're being played right now.

[01:56:47]
Not only that, but what you said earlier, if you do destroy that property, understand the lives that are going to be affected because that community is going to be entrenched in poverty for generations.

[01:57:01]
You're not doing good, you're harming. Stop harming, you know, start doing good.

[01:57:08]
Fine, fine, as we're on 9/11, the time may be the last time that we were united as a country where we're like, no, never again. Like, we can do that now. We really can.

[01:57:22]
I believe in the American spirit, but like this petty. Immature. Hate that people have against other people, like they're not other people, there are other Americans that believe in the same thing as you and that want the same thing as you.

[01:57:45]
They might have a different way of going about it and getting there and perspective.

[01:57:49]
But like, we all bleed red. You know, we all believe in the same thing.

[01:57:54]
We all want the same thing.

[01:57:55]
And just finding out how to get there, I wonder what can be done to decouple us from the influence of social media in terms of like there's no way you could stop as of right now. There's no way you could stop trolls. There's no way you can stop things like the Internet research agency in Russia or all these different online groups that are just completely created just to fuck with people. Yeah, there's no way we could stop that now.

[01:58:20]
Nope. If we could, we'd be better for it.

[01:58:23]
Yes, we'd be better for it. If we figure out what is actually happening, if we could clearly identify the source of all these different things and let people know. But people wouldn't even believe it right now. People are so jaded right now. If you said, hey, this is a Russian troll, people like, no, it's not. You just work for Trump. Yeah, I know what's going on here.

[01:58:40]
You're not going to trick me by my buddy Shane and I were talking about gaslighting this morning, and he flew.

[01:58:47]
He and his buddies flew their helicopters over the Trump parade that just happened here in Austin.

[01:58:55]
Like thousands of boats went out there and like a few boats sunk. And they're like one guy rented a boat and he forgot to put a plug in there.

[01:59:03]
And one of them is like a really crappy fishing boat that shouldn't have even been on the water. And then one guy bought a brand new boat, didn't even know how to operate it, and poor guy sunk his boat. But Shane Slick flying around and he sees everything, you know, and they're they're Robinson's 44.

[01:59:17]
They're like doing these cool V flights.

[01:59:19]
And, you know, gaslighting is. Telling somebody something that's not true, they're seeing it with their eyes, but they're hearing that it's not real, right.

[01:59:31]
The original play Gaslight was this guy making his wife be crazy.

[01:59:36]
He would he would adjust the he would be able to adjust the the wick on his gaslight so he would get darker.

[01:59:43]
And there is it darker in here?

[01:59:45]
It's like, no, it's this. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

[01:59:48]
What's so we're in a time where people are telling us what we're supposed to be seen, but that's not what we're seeing.

[01:59:56]
So I have this conflict, my supposed belief, what I'm seeing right here.

[01:59:59]
But we're being gaslight by the wrong information that's being curated in our hands, in our phones and on and on our TVs.

[02:00:09]
So the Lake Travis thing, in reality, there's hundreds of thousands, thousands of boats that are supporting Trump. Three sunk.

[02:00:18]
But the narrative you're hearing in the media, there's like this catastrophe, catastrophe. I wasn't there. I was working.

[02:00:24]
But like, my best friend is flying around in helicopters and he sees the whole and he has videos of everybody.

[02:00:32]
People are crazy on boats sometimes. But, you know, he literally sees the whole entire lake from a bird's eye view.

[02:00:40]
And he has photos of the the boats, the boats, the few that got were being towed in.

[02:00:46]
And he's like, those were the crappiest, you know, like, I don't even know how those things are on the water, but there's just people that want to participate and.

[02:00:54]
But what is this huge?

[02:00:57]
Half the boat sunk. There's twenty underwater.

[02:01:00]
You know, is this this disaster of an event like and I saw thousands of boats with, you know, titties being shown and people dancing in Trump flags and.

[02:01:11]
Am I being Laslett? He's asking this like that this is the definition of it is what is amazing that the narrative was the three failures. But if we take that as the micro and blow that up to the macro, if that happens in absolutely everything, the shooting here in Austin. Right. We have what happened and then we have what we're told right on both sides.

[02:01:33]
You know, I don't even I don't think you could take the final version of these two stories and be like this is the same the same situation that there's no possible way that these two stories that went to the right and went to the left that I'm now trying to. Kobori could could it could have happened in the same situation. That's how far the lies or the partial truths go. How do you fix that?

[02:02:01]
I think the only way to fix that is some kind of technology that allows you to accurately read exactly what's going on that doesn't exist right now. There might be something on the horizon that like some neural link type deal where they're working on the ability to bypass this.

[02:02:20]
Right now, the connection between human beings and information is you read it or you see it, but you don't really know what it is. Yeah. You know, you're reading it.

[02:02:27]
You're seeing it with confirmation, not reading. It's going from the person that is getting it to a thing. And then that thing is controlling what the next group sees.

[02:02:37]
Yes. And that's a huge problem. Yes. Like, I don't want my information curated.

[02:02:41]
I just want information. Right. And let me, as a rational, rational, reasonable person, be able to figure out that is the problem.

[02:02:48]
The problem. Right. The problem is you can't trust whoever. There's not there's not an unbiased source is not an unbiased unturn. And every source is also a corporation. They're all connected to the machine in some really deep and crazy way. The tentacles run deep. Whether it's CNN or Fox News or when OCN or whatever the fuck it is, yeah, whatever news source, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, they're all giant corporations. They all have huge political investments.

[02:03:22]
And they're going to give you some. Some. Super distorted version of what's actually there, no, there's not one person who will sit down. There's not there's no Walter Cronkite now on television. There's a few that are online. You can get a bunch online. And that's one of the reasons why online news journalism is flourishing and so many people are turning to these people that are online. Yeah. But they're also flawed because they're human and they have their own biases.

[02:03:50]
Sure, yeah. And no. I follow him on Twitter. He's he's been on the podcast, he has, yeah, pretty a passionate guy.

[02:04:01]
Now, I guess he was assaulted by Antifa. Yeah. They hit him with, like, some cement milkshake or something. Yeah.

[02:04:07]
And maybe the worst mistake they made because they ignited what was just kind of an independent journalist. Now he's like, no matter Tifa, you guys like beat me up, damage my brain and you know, but.

[02:04:22]
His journalism on Antifa, albeit trying to be as accurate as possible, we know he has bias because he doesn't like them. Yeah, because they hit him in the head, you know, they beat him and they threw cement milkshakes at him.

[02:04:34]
So even somebody that has trying to do the right thing, it's imperfect because with that person comes bias.

[02:04:42]
Like, how do we just get information?

[02:04:45]
Yeah, again, I really think that we're so limited because of the distribution methods that we have right now for getting out information, allow for prices now, you know, and I don't I don't know what the future has in store, but I think that we're going to come to a time in the not so distant future where you're going to be able to know exactly what's real and what's not real.

[02:05:08]
Yeah, I hope so. So cool. Yeah, I think it's going to be a lot of resistance against it too. We're going to find out. A lot of people are full of shit.

[02:05:15]
Yeah. How could that be if, you know, we have the fact checker, which is like the biggest bullshit ever as a politicians talking, it's like fact check in the person.

[02:05:25]
Fact checking is the most biased furthest thing from a objective fact check that you could possibly get.

[02:05:32]
There's like but you're checking the facts.

[02:05:34]
What if at as that person was talking real time like this is true?

[02:05:42]
Here's like the truth, not Wikipedia statistics. Not like Google also created statistics, not like information driven from whatever News Corporation, but just like the real data was next to that person as they're doing the next debate if a debate happens.

[02:05:59]
Very cool. I don't think you don't think it's going to happen. How can you have a debate? Biden's not going to do it. I don't think he can. I don't think he can stand there for that long and last.

[02:06:09]
I don't even know what his ideas are. But that's the point of the debate, right, is, is for me to learn about somebody's platform. Well, you know, at this point, he's doing well by not talking.

[02:06:22]
That's not doing well. It hurts him. No, I. I don't I don't I would never allow him if I was in the DNC. I like there's no way you're debating Trump's going to destroy him.

[02:06:34]
But that doesn't matter because the ideas are the thing that we're voting on, but it doesn't matter because people want to see who can hang in a debate and they don't want to vote for a loser.

[02:06:44]
So if the guy gets up there and falls apart and the debate starts stumbling his words and starts flopping and forgetting what he was talking about, like Biden's done on multiple occasions, a lot of people are not going to vote, I swear.

[02:06:55]
I thought they have a scheduled debate in a couple of weeks. It's not going to happen, but I bet 100 bucks to that. That's usually where I learn about somebody. Yeah, yeah, they're not trying to learn, they're trying to win.

[02:07:08]
I don't know about especially like I love it when local politicians do debates because those are like no holds barred truth attacks. You know, like, well, I know you took money from this auto park place.

[02:07:21]
You know, like this guy's like, well, I know you're getting money from, you know, better O'Rorke.

[02:07:25]
And you're like, this is also, you know, like I'm learning so much right now that there's no way I would have learned. And they do.

[02:07:31]
And sooky. I mean, we kind of have an idea about Trump's policies, but how do we learn about Biden's policies?

[02:07:38]
Yeah, I don't know. I think they just I think Biden at this point just wants to win. I think the best way they think to win is to keep him from talking too much.

[02:07:45]
If I really had a guess, they the only Kamala Harris is on doing a lot of different interviews and talking. What do you laughing at it?

[02:07:51]
There's I'm trying to look up to see what the new information about the Bates's. And this is the story I found.

[02:07:57]
Trump's burns traditional debate prep with first face off less than three days, three weeks. What was he saying? We're supposed to supposed to be one in about three weeks. But right now he does not have a single mock debate and say, does it need to?

[02:08:08]
President Trump has not held a single mock debate, says she has no plans to stage a formal practice round as he readies for his first face off with Joe Biden less than three weeks. According to multiple people familiar with the discussions, the president has dismissed a typical debate, preparations he participated in four years ago, joking to aides and allies that he's been preparing for debates since he was born. This is what happens to fighters and they get their ass kicked.

[02:08:30]
His ability to fire back at an opponent in real time, he's argued, isn't something you have to practice. That's yeah. Maybe instead, Trump has so far chosen to prepare through informal discussions with key allies and with briefings from top officials in his administration on various topics that will likely come up like that, are likely to come up.

[02:08:50]
These people said, can you would you do a debate? Would I yeah, if like another problem I have with if I had to do a debate. No, no, not you debating somebody.

[02:09:03]
Oh, I'd prepare like a mother. I know you would. You'd be fun to watch.

[02:09:07]
But you be the control mechanism to the candidates like a Biden Trump debate with Joe Rogan hosting your questions.

[02:09:20]
I would want that. First of all, I'd want no one else in the room. I just the people's cameras so we can record the.

[02:09:28]
Yeah, just the three of us. And you would have to stream it live so no one can edit it.

[02:09:31]
And I would want them in there for hours and ideas. We get to hear what they actually believe in, what they're going to do, who they're going to appoint. Yeah, what judges are going to be coming in. What policies from gun control to. Yes, all of it.

[02:09:46]
Yes. Why can't we have that. We should have that. This is twenty twenty. I mean we have the ability to have that. We're not talking about 1979, we're talking about twenty twenty. If they wanted to do that, they both wanted to come here in Austin, sit down and have a debate. I would 100 percent do it. My God I would 100 percent do it. Amazing. It would be the best way to find out.

[02:10:05]
But I don't think that Biden can handle I think Biden is like I think he's I mean, people get mad at me for saying this. I think there's something wrong. And I don't think there's something wrong because I'm guessing or because I'm pro Trump, I've seen him fall apart.

[02:10:18]
I see. I've seen him start talking. He's had multiple brain surgeries. This this is him saying, I sent you that thing yesterday.

[02:10:26]
Right. We'll do this.

[02:10:29]
This is something I mean, I'm not trying to be biased in any way, shape or form. I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter. I, I just want to see support would be.

[02:10:38]
Yeah. Do you a commander in chief. I Torcy. Yeah. Let me toast you JoCo. One hundred percent.

[02:10:43]
That would be a fun jako run for president. Just the beginning of it. Just the beginning of it. He starts talking about his brain surgery. The only uncharted person, totally uncharted portion of the universe is the brain. You know, I had. As we used to say in the Senate, excuse the point of personal privilege here. I had two cranial aneurysms and they literally had to take the top of my head off, I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off and go in to find the artery that is one was leaking the other that hadn't before it burst.

[02:11:28]
Those of your docs know there's every every procession, every profession has their sick jokes. The joke among Bond docs is how do you know someone's had an aneurysm, cranial aneurysm on the autopsy table? Only 20 percent of the people have it even get to the table. Well, one of the fascinating things is the second operation after the first one was there was a bleed and they gave me a relatively low chance of surviving. I remember going down to Doc, asking the doc and, you know, you're counting the ceiling tiles and you're heading into the operating room and what have you been there?

[02:12:01]
And I said, what are my chances to great neurosurgeons? And I'll never forget I will not mention his name because one of the leading neurosurgeons in the world, he said, Senator for mortality or morbidity.

[02:12:18]
And I'm thinking, I swear to God, it was good.

[02:12:25]
Now, this is not a knock on this guy. I'm happy he's alive. But that this is what we're talking about. We're talking about someone who these are legit issues.

[02:12:35]
This is not he's going to be sitting in a briefing room when. A bunch of people from the Pentagon walk in and say, we have found the number one terrorist on the planet, what do you want us to do? And that guy has to make a choice, and this is, by the way, when he was vice president, this is this is quite a while ago. Yes. This film.

[02:12:55]
So. OK, well, the keeping something, the only thing that comes from isolation is a Unabomber, like there's nothing good that you can take a candidate and stick him in a basement and hide him there when he is going to have to be in front of seven billion people and be their representative and both foreign and domestic about how we're going to be operating. And if that that scares me, it's weird.

[02:13:26]
It's I know there's other people that could run for president. I just don't understand why they chose him and why they work so hard to make sure that he's the guy. Yeah, it's it's weird that the Democrats chose that.

[02:13:37]
Do you think we're going to have regardless of who wins, do you think we're going to have a fair election? I hope so.

[02:13:44]
I don't know. I'm not informed enough to make a you know.

[02:13:48]
Do you think here we are in September, we have September, October, and then we have the election?

[02:13:53]
Yeah, it's pretty quick. Super quick.

[02:13:55]
November 3rd is around the corner. I argue that right now people are trying to negatively affect our election for sure, and we kind of have to be aware of that.

[02:14:11]
So the next time that you pick up your phone and you're like, do you want to fry this guy, you know, at white privilege?

[02:14:20]
Twitter handle, I'm going to get you like that, that person just wants you to do exactly what you're doing, which is be mad.

[02:14:26]
There's a high probability that there's a lot of that going on and it's just feeding the flames of hate.

[02:14:33]
And it's even worse because we've had this stupid pandemic that has locked people into the echo chamber of their own ideas.

[02:14:39]
And you can also see the worse, by the way Trump behaves in the way he communicates this this polarizing way that got him famous.

[02:14:47]
You know, you're fired and fuck you and get out of here and all this this way that he's become famous, it doesn't suit someone to be the commander in chief.

[02:14:56]
So all these people that say that he's not presidential, he's not he doesn't act like a statesman. They're right. They are right. He said this is not what you would want from a person who's the leader. You'd want someone who exemplary. You'd want someone who's speaking in a way that would make you proud, like that is an American president. And the way the speaking part, that is what we got from Barack Obama we got from him is so presidential.

[02:15:18]
Amazingly, presidential is presidential, as anybody who's ever been, I would argue, more so than anybody, ever even than Clinton. Clinton, when he was at his best, I think he was really good.

[02:15:28]
I think Obama was better, but well-spoken, articulate, everything. Yes. Measured. You know, it made you feel good that a guy smarter than you was the president. You don't feel like that would trump you like Jesus.

[02:15:41]
Don't say that. What the fuck are you doing? Get out of here. It's like I'm not like I'm not a supporter of Trump when I'm seeing.

[02:15:49]
What I'm seeing, though, is that if you're not if you don't ignore all the things that are going on with Biden somehow or another, you're a bad person. And that that to me, as a person, as a comedian, as a person who hates fundamentalism, as a person who hates rabid ideology, that's driving me crazy because this shit is all right in front of you. You watch them stumble through his words constantly left and right. We're ignoring the fact that he's 77 years old.

[02:16:16]
We're ignoring all these signs that show. I'm not saying that you should vote for Trump. What I'm saying is, how the fuck are the Democrats running with this? How is this in twenty twenty?

[02:16:27]
This is what we're doing. Yeah, this is this is what we're doing.

[02:16:32]
And even the choice of Tulsi Gabbard, I mean, of of locking Tulsi Gabbard out, rather the choice of eliminating her, the whole thing sat with me.

[02:16:40]
It's so gross the way they did it, the way they pushed her out. That way they wouldn't even let her speak at the DNC.

[02:16:46]
It's wrong. And, you know, and it was almost like that she got canceled by her own party. Yeah. Yeah. It's exactly what it's like.

[02:16:55]
And that's that's evil, right?

[02:16:56]
Like we have a smart veteran to two terms or six terms, rather, as six years as a congresswoman to two overseas tours to been a congressman for six fucking years. Exemplary record, really reasonable, really intelligent displays. All of the things you would all the qualities of leadership that you would want from someone running for president. Let's doxa.

[02:17:20]
Yeah, let's do that.

[02:17:22]
Yeah, the whole thing was crazy. The whole thing was crazy.

[02:17:25]
And then and then his choice to shoot, like he literally said, I'm going to choose a woman as a running mate. Yeah, well, how about choose the best person. That best person happens to be a woman. That's great. But if you tell me you're going to specifically eliminate males, what will you're thinking in terms of identity politics?

[02:17:43]
Is this the same Joe Biden that's been in politics for fifty fucking years? All of a sudden you're an ideologue who is going with identity politics over the best person for the job? Absolutely. Clearly.

[02:17:54]
Clearly, that's this is crazy talk, Komala. So the parties differ on the police, right? That's a left progressive idea. She is literally the police.

[02:18:06]
She's a cop and not like if we're going to solidarity to Black Lives Matter and believe that we can positively affect change what she was doing as a cop, she's the worst of the cops she was targeting in the most racist, vicious way, trying to attack. Black communities and black, you know, not even criminals like drug drug users and just hammered them with everything she possibly could and but now she's our vice president.

[02:18:39]
President not only that, she withheld evidence that would show that people were innocent, withheld it from defense attorneys.

[02:18:46]
She kept people incarcerated to use them as cheap labor to fight fire when they were supposed to be released.

[02:18:54]
Now, what do we have to do to get a Tulsi JoCo or a you like the rock? I love the rock. Yeah, he would be like a tulsi rock or like the Jacuzzi.

[02:19:05]
They could literally win. They could literally win. And I would be 100 percent in support of that. It's just we're dealing with this machine, man, and this machine wants to stay in control.

[02:19:14]
And who is going to be a good player for the machine? Who's going to who's going to do the right thing? Who's going to do the bidding? I mean, this is how they got Bernie Sanders out both times they weaseled him out and he still he bends the knee to them every time. What I don't know why he's a good guy. I don't know. Doesn't want conflict. I don't know. Yeah, it's a very reasonable guy when I have a ton of respect for him.

[02:19:37]
While I disagree with a lot of his positions in politics, I disagree with a bunch of policies on on foreign policy about how to do that. But be a conversation she and I could.

[02:19:47]
Yes, well, I would love to have you have that is the way you explain it. And from your own personal experience, serving this is not just something I can pull it off very ideas.

[02:19:58]
I go everywhere with these things, like I journal, kind of like I take little weird notes and you could go.

[02:20:05]
And they're all dated from trips to Iraq to Afghanistan to Niger to Nigeria, to Burkina Faso, to Mauritania, to Morocco, to South Africa, like every freaking crazy place that I have to go.

[02:20:19]
And you could look and then like, go for two years, three years and look again, I'd be like, what?

[02:20:24]
Look, this change like it's black and white written in front of you.

[02:20:29]
And my impressions of physically being there at the same place removed by twenty four months. And that has happened time and time again.

[02:20:35]
That's why I wanted to have you want to talk about this, because this is a narrative that doesn't get discussed because it's either you're pro Trump or you're Pro and Biden. And if you're for Trump, you're a racist. And if you're for Biden, you're a fool like this.

[02:20:47]
It's like these narratives are so goddamn stupid and they're so damaging to us. And I think a lot of them have been reinforced and stoked.

[02:20:55]
The flames have been stoked by people in other countries that are acting as trolls. I think that's a lot of what's going on. There's a fucking great video. See if you can find the cat, what you got so much as you guys are talking.

[02:21:06]
I found some I didn't want to interrupt with, but support what we're talking about.

[02:21:11]
As our veins were popping to the both Joan of Arc, Ra, Ra Ra, Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers, all targeting twenty twenty election.

[02:21:19]
Microsoft says it's not a blog today and it detail what's been going on with these. But does this surprise anyone?

[02:21:25]
So if they are doing this, what else are they doing in real time? So they're not just online. If you don't think that there are, we call them DJed burgs.

[02:21:33]
If you don't think that there are foreign operatives that are working here, both at universities and in cities, part of the political process or part of the Antifa strategic organization, they are doing this in real time.

[02:21:48]
In person, not just online, is crazy.

[02:21:51]
We we've observed, yeah, straughn strontium operating from Russia has attacked more than 200 organizations, including political campaigns, advocacy groups, parties and political consultants.

[02:22:03]
Zirconium operating in China has attacked high profile individuals associated with the election, including people associated with the Joe Biden for President campaign and the prominent leaders in the international affairs community. Phosphorus operating from Iran has continued to attack the personal accounts of people associated with Donald Trump for president campaign. Yeah, they're fucking with us.

[02:22:25]
But look. Yeah. Is it one side or the other? No, no. Over the place.

[02:22:31]
Trump, Biden, the parties, the consultants.

[02:22:34]
The point is they have to diligent, delegitimize the process.

[02:22:37]
Right. And and the only way in the best way to do it is just to make it look bad and to make us fight and to make us argue and like the fact that there's people walking down the street being like, I hate cops, you guys are evil.

[02:22:49]
But do you know any or did you just read write what?

[02:22:52]
You've just been reading what has been echoed, like my friend Matt Sun, who called the cops when the fucking the house was making noise. Yeah, that's that's that's who these people are.

[02:23:00]
Hey, David, there's a video of a crow fucking with these two cats.

[02:23:06]
It's one of my favorite videos. There's a crow and there's these two cats that are looking at each other from opposing rooftops. And like we're look at each other and the crow gets over and gets near the cat and starts fucking with them. The Catholic, get out of here. Watch this. So here's the cat. And there's a crow and the crow flies over and starts fucking with these cats and gets these cats to duke it out. He's he literally instigates this fight.

[02:23:30]
Look, he flies over a fucking bird is coming near a cat. Why would he do that? He's doing it because he wants to fuck with him. So he gets him a little agitated and then he flies back and gets him a little agitated, just fucks with them just a little bit. And then he flies over to the other cat and he goes back and forth and fucks with look at who goes behind him and fucks with them. He's irritating them.

[02:23:50]
Crows are fucking smart, man. And this little cunt just starts pestering these cats and gets these cat. Look at him. He's pecking at his ass. He's literally looks and the cat, if I remember, if the cat reacts by jumping over and fucking attacking the other cat, they go off the room and the crowd follows them. This fucking crow is a monster. That crow is all the online trolls. Yeah. These are Biden and Trump supporters engaged in more mortal combat here.

[02:24:20]
The crowd. They go down the fucking hole with a basement and the crows like that, that fucking losers. You're black, you're white. Isn't that amazing?

[02:24:29]
Yeah, the video. That's it right there. I fucking love that video. That video is exactly what's going on right now.

[02:24:35]
They were just looking at each other. Yeah. The cats are just looking at each other. They probably would have gone the rest of the day without fighting.

[02:24:41]
Yeah, that crap and some milk chasing a mouse, you know, but no got of a crow starting to get fired up.

[02:24:47]
And that that that crows Russia and China and Iran and every other country that hates us.

[02:24:51]
And then those two nice peaceful cats fell off a roof fighting.

[02:24:56]
That's what we're doing. We were like literally pushing each other off another one. Crows do it constantly. Look at them. Look at them just walking up to that cat. Fuck with them.

[02:25:05]
They like watching fights. Look at like they get asked. You guys get after it at top. Get come on. How funny is that that crows like to do so awesome. They do it on purpose, those little twats. It's kind of amazing. It is kind of amazing.

[02:25:20]
I mean, I got props to the crow for figuring that out, but I guess crows are just like people we all like watching fights. Yeah.

[02:25:26]
And and looking at Americans, it's pretty easy to know how to piss us off now. Yes. Like every single one of these little hot button topics pop up. There's somebody over there like, oh, either push that button that a new button pops up like, oh, I'm going to push that button. How many buttons can we have right now?

[02:25:41]
Because we're getting so pissed off at everything. Know we're all button.

[02:25:45]
We're all button. Yeah, we're there. Buttons go outside, go exercise, go do something.

[02:25:50]
You go have sex. Yeah. Please. You know, if you want to make a change, like don't throw a Molotov cocktail, go find a police officer and talk to him for a little bit or go find go to Baltimore and talk to the black community there and figure out how you can help.

[02:26:03]
He, like has anyone gone and figured out how they can help one of these communities?

[02:26:08]
No, because they don't care. No, that's that's not that doesn't get you. Instagram likes the other thing that's going on, too, that I the timing of the fucking pandemic is so crazily perfect.

[02:26:21]
I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the sense like, I don't I don't believe in nonsense. There's just too much nonsense going on. But, God, if I was, I would be looking at this like this is this is so perfectly organized. And then the response, like, keep people from working, keep people from working. So what?

[02:26:37]
So they're broke and scared and angry and then they're even more subject to this shit.

[02:26:42]
And now as we're five months removed, we're having that same conversation about schools. Well, schools as a necessary component for people to work. Like if your kids are in school, you can't go to work because that's a form of child care for a lot of households.

[02:26:56]
Yes. And we're like, oh, I'm not sure it's safe.

[02:27:01]
You know, I was joking about injecting myself with covid in my neck, like you could take my breast fed babies that eat elk and free range chickens and have lived in safety and security and entire lives.

[02:27:12]
And you could, like, cover the whole entire room with covid.

[02:27:16]
And my 10 month old is going to poop that stuff out in like an hour, you know, because they're healthy, balanced, powerful individuals. My teenage daughters, like we have not lived a day in this whole entire pandemic, really recognizing what we're supposed to be doing.

[02:27:32]
We have maintained health outside activities, exercise, hunting, real food and like so, so better situated and prepared now for what looks like a scary six months in the future.

[02:27:49]
I'm scared because this entire country, six billion people have been locked up moving into an election. That is going to be a frightening. Dangerous election. Yeah, so there's no winners in this election, but time her wins, whoever wins is going to be chaos.

[02:28:08]
So you think when you say I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but here we are with a pandemic that shut down our economy for five months on an election year that looks like it was the origin is in China. What are your theories? I just think that, first of all, the I talking to Brett Weinstein about it, who's a biologist, and he went into great.

[02:28:34]
If you were listening to this podcast, please go back and listen to the most recent podcast I did with Borat, which is like, what, four months ago? Jamy three months ago, maybe something along those lines? Yeah, maybe maybe even two months ago.

[02:28:47]
He detailed the the scientific reasons why he believes this came from a lab.

[02:28:54]
And there is a and and he said, I do not know for certain, but with with reasonable speculation, you could look at this and say this makes a lot of sense.

[02:29:06]
That was come from because of these particular reasons.

[02:29:09]
Yeah, that lab was cited in twenty eighteen for safety violations.

[02:29:14]
This is I mean China because because it's a communist country. Right. Because they're a dictatorship.

[02:29:21]
There's not a lot of incentive to behave the way you would hope that an organization would behave like you're under the knife in the boot of the government all the time, that people don't do the best work when they're scared like that now and that lab.

[02:29:40]
And there's no incentive. No incentive.

[02:29:42]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have how much you work. Fear's your only incentive. You don't get anything more for working harder or better.

[02:29:49]
Right. You just don't get killed. So twenty eighteen. They were cited for safety violations. This is exactly the same area where they're doing this work on coronaviruses from bots. And this is exactly where the the origin of the disease was. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it came from there.

[02:30:07]
They don't think that it came on purpose, though. They think it was just a sloppy leak from the lab. Sometimes things happen where they're just perfectly aligned and then people take advantage of those opportunities. They take advantage of these situations, like there's a lot of people that believe that 9/11 was an inside job. What I think is when they found when 9/11 happened, I think there was many people that took advantage of the chaos and there was things that were passed like the Patriot Act.

[02:30:35]
I'm fired up on that switch reference, that constitution again. Yeah, it's sweeping.

[02:30:41]
But I talked to Snowden recently, these sweeping just overall surveillance of law abiding citizens that are doing nothing wrong. And they lied about it. They lied about they all lied about it a lot about the Congress, a lot about it to our face. Obama lied about it. Everybody lied about it. They knew what the fuck they were doing. They took advantage of the fact that people were scared and they started just just going in everybody's shit, single, most intrusive moment in American history.

[02:31:07]
And our freedoms are not being encroached on, not like a little trickle of, you know, cut by a thousand or a death by a thousand cuts like 9/11 happened.

[02:31:17]
We lost and gave up so much of our perceived rights, like, no, you can't look at my emails.

[02:31:25]
Like, I thought my emails were protected, like my mail. You can't open my mail without a warrant.

[02:31:29]
There's a due process to that that's gone. Right.

[02:31:32]
Like, I think every single twenty year old right now expects that every text message that they send in, every Facebook message, D.M. Instagram Twitch, every one of those things can be read by somebody else that they don't own that stuff.

[02:31:48]
That's how I grew up. I grew up like that was my ideas. Those are my words. Those that's my property.

[02:31:53]
If somebody wants it, they have to have a warrant to look at it.

[02:31:57]
Now, go from 9/11 to Caronna now the second most serious time that we lost more of our freedoms, 9/11.

[02:32:06]
And this, Winston Churchill said, never waste a good crisis. Yes.

[02:32:11]
And you want to know when a government is going to overreach? It's in crisis. Yes.

[02:32:16]
And if you are not a strong, healthy individual that is able to be self-sufficient and be able to rationally look at things without getting spun up by the echo chamber that you're living in and Twitter, you're going to allow that to happen because you're just being pitted against each other by this dribble that's been pushed into your face by people that are just trying to profiteer off of what you see and what you hear and what you think.

[02:32:40]
That's exactly what I think is happening right now. That's exactly the thing that's happening. I think there's people that are taking advantage of this crisis. So I think the way to fight that is as a society. To unify. To reasonably collectively be like now, you said they can't you know, they canceled Halloween, yeah, they can't cancel Halloween. Fucking crazy. No, they can't. The only way that they can is you allowing it to happen.

[02:33:10]
Yeah, right. They can't shut down your salon.

[02:33:12]
They can't tell you you can't go door to door and trick or treat. Right. Can't they cannot. They can't do that. They can try. And the only way that they can't do it is if you go and do it.

[02:33:21]
But the fact is there's no uniformity because they're allowing people to protest. So you're allowing people to protest about some things, but some things because black lives matter. That's it.

[02:33:30]
Allowed. Yeah. You could counter covid protest, right. You do need to get covid.

[02:33:35]
Los Angeles backtracks on coronaviruses trick or treat bands. Solomon Good. You fucks. They should drown.

[02:33:40]
They go. The fact that you even considered it donc you all in toilets.

[02:33:47]
Yeah we did. We did it in an hour. We tried California.

[02:33:51]
Well, everybody freaked out. Now about 30000 people moved out of California the day they released my my wife got a text from one of her friends. She's like, fuck this, I'm out of here. And she sent her the news on California banning trick or treat. That was that was her thing.

[02:34:06]
Now, pedophilia alone would be another reason to leave.

[02:34:08]
You know, I got out of California pretty good. There are a lot of pedophilia in California.

[02:34:12]
Yeah. Well, here's another piece of legislation that's kind of been passed to, oh, what is that? You put that on your Instagram? Is it is that real? Is that 100 percent legit? That's real. So is that really mean that a 20 year old can have sex with a 10 year old 10 year because it's a 10 year difference. So but isn't statutory rape anybody who's under 18?

[02:34:31]
So that's lessening the penalty for it.

[02:34:34]
So let's say a and the the trans community, LGBTQ community was in big support of this bill because it's not fair for male to female.

[02:34:47]
So if, let's say, a 17 year old has sex with a 15 year old and she gets or I'm sorry, a 19 year old has sex with a 15 year old and she gets pregnant, there is a law in place where.

[02:35:01]
The he is not going to go on the sex registry because he is a father to that child, would have a difficult time being able to, if he's on a sex registry, get a job, pay for child support.

[02:35:13]
So they have kind of protections in place where if that's only in California.

[02:35:17]
Yeah, but if he had orally or anally had sex with her, then the law would be the penalty would be more severe, severe.

[02:35:30]
He would be on the sex offender list because he's not trying to procreate.

[02:35:39]
So the the community, like the LGBTQ community, was like, this is an unfair.

[02:35:46]
Law, because, you know, if it's a gay relationship, they have a harsher penalty than a male and female relationship, so they should be the same.

[02:35:59]
If while I recognize that and I acknowledge that that's the case and I want it to be fair, but I also don't want a 19 year or 24 year old having sex with a 15 year old.

[02:36:12]
Yeah, no, I don't care where it is. You know, that's crazy.

[02:36:15]
There's a reason 18 is 18. I mean, it's a good number. It's not. It should be later. How old do you think you should be?

[02:36:22]
Well, I mean, to have sex, I guess 18.

[02:36:23]
But like, I was a disaster at 18. Well, I was, too, but I can vote at 18. But if I was 18 and a 23 year old woman wanted to fuck me, I don't think she should go to jail now. I was ready. Yeah.

[02:36:34]
I mean, the 18 year olds already like the problem is our perceptions of sex. I mean, I'm talking about someone who's a grown adult. Yeah. I feel like 18 is at least pretty close to a grown grown adult. Maybe, you know, voting we should extend to 21. We're drinking is. Yeah, it might not be the worst idea in the world, but as far as, like, being responsible for your actions, 18 is a good number.

[02:36:56]
18 is where and that was the point of my post, is that that person can have consent. Yes.

[02:37:04]
The way there's Lynton written was somebody willfully having an oral sex. Right. I'm saying anybody under 18, if you can't. You're not willful, you're not allowed to be willful. Right, because you don't have the right to have consent yet. Right.

[02:37:20]
You're too young. Too young. You're not an adult. No. Yeah. That's a fucked up law.

[02:37:25]
And we only get the the crazy sex trafficking of I saw the picture of the guy who made the bill to dress like a fucking dog collar on.

[02:37:33]
He's a weirdo. I hope you don't make any laws, especially around sex. Yeah, it's.

[02:37:40]
But I just don't understand how it passed. It didn't.

[02:37:44]
She signed how the fuck it just has to be signed by Newton. It's oh yeah, pass legislation. Yeah, it's passed. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. You just need a signature drive.

[02:37:55]
Jesus Christ, that seems so insane that a 20 year old can fuck a ten year old. Yeah. Like a 20 year old can have a 10 year old boyfriend and decide that it's consent. A 20 year old man can have a 10 year old boyfriend and as long as it's within the ten year boundary.

[02:38:10]
So, like, again, I realize unconscious bias.

[02:38:14]
I have a pretty jaded view of things. And when it comes to, like children, you know, heavily involved in counter sex trafficking, you know, moving from deliver fun to guarding group to now with Victor Marks, you know, fighting worldwide and and nationally, like the this disgusting thing that is pedophilia like that is not a sexual orientation.

[02:38:37]
And people in power like finding children to victimize and they are worth money.

[02:38:43]
But this is a thing now where people are trying to portray it as a sexual inclination, as a sexual proclivity, like there's a TED talk about you seen that this woman is talking about how we have to have compassion for pedophilia the same way we have compassion for homosexuals or trans people. It's like, what are you talking about?

[02:39:04]
Well, I mean, I have compassion for the person, but I'm not going to have compassion for any of their actions.

[02:39:11]
And if they need help, we can get them help, like put them in an institution and they can realign whatever their problems are.

[02:39:20]
But also being attracted to a child. Yeah.

[02:39:22]
Is a is period wrong end of story. I don't care what you think. I agree 100 percent.

[02:39:28]
But here's the thing. How does that woman know like this is the thing about pedophilia, like someone who's not a pedophile, to say that this person is a pedophile can't help themselves. How do you know?

[02:39:38]
Like, what do you what are you basing this on? Are you basing that you're not basing on your own personal feelings? Like, I know I am attracted to women. It's I know it because it's it's I know there's a lot of people like me. Right. And so if I talked to another guy and he goes, that girl's hot. Yes, she is hot. I get it. I see what you see. But if you're talking about someone who's attracted to children, that's so fucking alien to me.

[02:40:01]
So if you're telling me that someone can't help themselves because this is a natural sexual inclination, like, how do you know that? I don't I don't know that that's true. And I don't know what the fuck you do to save them or to fix them. I don't know.

[02:40:13]
But I think the primary concern is protecting children, primary him more than like like having compassion for pedophiles, you know, protection.

[02:40:23]
We have to put action to that word. What is protection look like? That is law. That is legislation.

[02:40:28]
That is people that are being able to stand not not allow evil to happen. Right. For evil to conquer. It just takes good men doing nothing, standing back and be like, yeah, man, I guess they could recognize and align themselves with being attracted.

[02:40:40]
No, no, no, no, not a chance. The idea is do something and you touch a child. I'll tell you. That's good.

[02:40:47]
Yeah. Not good. No. Yeah. And it shouldn't. And that's how everybody feels. Everybody has children. And specifically fuck just the fact that they actually can get all the way through to the governor's office is bonkers.

[02:41:01]
Yeah.

[02:41:01]
Well who knows what he's going to do, you know, lick his finger, find out which way the wind's blowing, how progressive am I going to be here? You know, I'm all I'm all about getting re-elected. And his chances of reelecting now are fucking slim to none. Thank God they hate him now. Oh, my God. He was the darling of California. Beautiful man, slicked back hair. Look great. Speaks well. I fucking hate him there.

[02:41:26]
Now, my brother says of my sister lives in Paso and her husband, who I call my brother because we've been best friends for kids since kids.

[02:41:36]
He works for a nuclear power plant, Chad. And so he's he's pretty like military go getter, a hard worker. You know, my sister's a home schooler. She's homeschooled all their kids. They're brilliant, like play multiple instruments, like, you know, grades ahead of everybody else.

[02:41:52]
And while the whole entire world is like, what are we going to do about education? My sister's like individual responsibility. You could have been doing it yourself. Now everybody has that opportunity. I understand.

[02:42:00]
And my my my parents with being landowner's, my brother being a police officer like we have been in California for, you know, that's where I grew up. And we have been fighting for rational, reasonable.

[02:42:14]
Politics in that in that and we feel like we're in a foreign land. Yeah, you know, you ask how I came to Texas is like as a coward.

[02:42:23]
I just couldn't I said I wanted to be in a fight, that I got a chance of winning. Yeah.

[02:42:28]
Like maybe now for the first time, California has a has a hope, a chance of like changing the course of where they've been.

[02:42:35]
The trajectory damage has been done though. You can do it. You can and do it.

[02:42:39]
I love Dan Crenshaw's.

[02:42:40]
And if he said that if every law that's written we have to unwrite another law, you know, it's a hard thing to do to take legislation that's already been approved and passed and then remove it. That's a harder thing than getting a new law. Right.

[02:42:56]
So now we have like this crazy amount of laws, both local, state, federal, and they just keep stacking on top of each other. And they're not none of them are good or most of them aren't.

[02:43:08]
I'd love Dan Cranshaw. That's another guy who's run for president. Yes, just I just think California I mean, there was an article that was written about me being a coward from leaving my job. Yeah, totally. You should stay and fight like fuck you, fuck you and fuck you for a bunch of reasons. We could start with you not letting people go back to work. And I think that's unconstitutional and insane. And I think that's so shortsighted.

[02:43:34]
And people were furious.

[02:43:35]
And then when you see Nancy Pelosi go to a fucking hair salon without a mask, you like, oh, I see how you people really are.

[02:43:42]
You can also never listen to anyone that is telling you to lose a gun when they're protected by private security. 100 percent. You saw that with the mayor of Chicago. She's all for protest until they came to her block. And she's like, get the protests off my block. I have a right to protect myself. What the fuck are you talking about? That's what everybody's secret.

[02:44:00]
Yes, you hypocrite.

[02:44:01]
Yeah, it's just and this is what happens when people get into power. This is my problem.

[02:44:07]
They're protected in time position. Exactly. Surrounded by people with guns.

[02:44:12]
And they're telling other people, us, you can't go to salons, you can't get your hair done, you can't go and have a gun. But I'm going to sit here in my high tower because I know what's best for you.

[02:44:22]
I just I don't know what the solution is I've thought about. Yeah. Vote them out. But even then, I think there's a problem with one person running things. I mean, I really think there's a problem with a mayor or a governor. I think there should be a committee.

[02:44:35]
I think there should be a group of people there. There is. Right. You have your city council.

[02:44:39]
So here in Austin, we have a dumb mayor and that mayor has a bunch of city council people that's also dumb, that are also dumb and do dumb things like defund the police.

[02:44:49]
Yeah, but thank God we have 100 million. One hundred fifty. One hundred and fifty. Yeah. The governor stepped in and said, OK, well if you do that you don't get any property tax. So genius. He's brilliant. Yeah. It's a brilliant move by the governor.

[02:45:02]
And if safety becomes so, such a concern here, he will Rhode Island State Police to.

[02:45:11]
Makeups, yeah, the difference good thing in Texas keeps you're going to learn a little bit about them, they're amazing. Department of Public Safety for Texas. It's our state police force. They're they're incredible. They have this super military academy. And I think people, when they hear military like us talking about that virtual reality training that we're going get to law enforcement, like why is a special forces guy training law enforcement like they don't need a police officer, doesn't need to be special forces now.

[02:45:41]
You don't need a tank or an 84 or, you know, a 50 cal unless you're fighting the cartels.

[02:45:47]
But what you do need is the process of the refiner's fire and being able to train imperfections out of people like. Could you imagine if a city council member had to ride along with the police for a month?

[02:46:02]
That's a great idea to go on the calls with them.

[02:46:04]
Domestic disputes, pullovers for DUIs, not sit in the car. They got to get out and walk up to that car. They've got to put their hand on the back of the car, put their fingerprint on there, because if they die, they want a little bit of evidence.

[02:46:17]
You know, police officers do that every time they walk up to a car.

[02:46:20]
If you watch them, they go in. They're like put their thumb or their hand on the back of the car. So their print is on the car. So if they get killed there later, you can find out who did the crazy. How sad that is. It is. But as that police officers walking up there.

[02:46:34]
Hello, sir. You know, you're going 85 in a 65.

[02:46:37]
I smell alcohol. I have to ask you to get out of the car. We're going to do a sobriety check here on the side of the road, which is dangerous, and overhears a city council member that was just recently elected. And they're going to be observing this. How cool is that?

[02:46:52]
There would be a good idea. It would eliminate a lot of people from that fucking job. Yeah, yeah.

[02:46:56]
They'd also not that understand. Like you said, how do we get this information out, like if you could do anything to, you know, like Tulsi Gabbard and I are going to debate about foreign policy, I first have to explain and let them understand what I've seen. And that's a hard thing to do unless somebody sees it and then it changes, you know, their view, you know, fun times, man.

[02:47:23]
What do you think happens in November, do you think? First of all, do you think that this whole voting by mail thing, which is being hotly contested?

[02:47:34]
It's so I get very nervous when one side's really into it and one side's really not into it. I don't like that.

[02:47:41]
That makes me real nervous because I don't know what the fuck is going on and everything that like if you pull my wallet out, I have a license from the FAA. Like, I had to send them a whole bunch of stuff for media.

[02:47:56]
But to get into a helicopter. Right. I have my driver's license.

[02:47:59]
I have my concealed carry permit of my security consulting license.

[02:48:02]
I have my DOD ID like that's five different IDs that are like, I can't go do anything in any one of those fields without it.

[02:48:10]
A little picture of my face and and I really like that because like, I can't access a government computer without that card.

[02:48:18]
I can't go in and signed my and my my annual review, my NCAR without my card and it's like proof of who I am and what I'm doing.

[02:48:28]
And the thought that they're going to mail out tens of thousands, if not millions of ballots to dead people to.

[02:48:40]
They don't even know who they're just sending them to addresses. Did you see what Kate what's her name? Kayleigh McEnany. How do you say her name? The woman is the White House press secretary. She see if you can find this. She said that 117 percent of the people that are registered to vote in California just find the quote because it's kind of crazy.

[02:49:00]
But she was talking about here's the problem she was arguing for against voter voting online or excuse me, voting by mail. She's like, this is why, like what is happening here where there's 17 percent more people than are registered to vote that have the opportunity to vote in California there in 2016.

[02:49:18]
And I know I butchered that. I know. But I mean, I've got other stuff ready to go for this. I've been paying attention to this. OK, there's like no proof of voter fraud or by mail that I've looked up and found that anybody else has been looking up and find that just saying that it's going to be a problem without providing evidence.

[02:49:35]
Nobody's done it, though. Yeah. No one's done at this scale. I mean, no one's done it like they're going to do it. What they're saying is they're trying to do all the voting by mail or a giant percentage of it by mail. That's never happened before.

[02:49:46]
The same with the post office problem. They're like, no, we are not going to negatively affect the election. We're going to try to do everything that we can by, like, the post office. Like, I don't know if we can do this right now.

[02:49:58]
Yeah. When someone's saying there's no evidence for voter fraud in the past. Yeah, right. But what percentage of people voted by mail in the past has been reasonably small? Find out that Kennedy quote, because it's a kind of crazy thing, 117 percent California registered.

[02:50:15]
She she was explaining how there's there's multiple issues with this, like these people that are sending in these mail in ballots. Like how many these people how many of these are legit?

[02:50:25]
How do you find out how much how much research has to be done, how much investigation has to be done to make sure that these are eligible to see some of the districts in Illinois during the 2006 election, 2016 election, there was like one hundred and four percent came in for. Yeah, Obama.

[02:50:42]
Yeah, like, that's not right. So it's possible.

[02:50:47]
It doesn't make sense. It's like I'm 100 percent committed, OK, but I'm 110 percent committed that this is simply can't be to stop there.

[02:50:55]
You can't be one hundred and ten. I know you want a bigger number, but that's an American thing to want.

[02:51:00]
But what I'm trying to look this up for her, all I'm finding are reports saying that she's voted by mail a lot of times.

[02:51:07]
Yeah, but that's not where we're asking. I know.

[02:51:09]
And I'm looking for the article that's so hard to find to find the specific. Have you ever started to type in like a Twitter?

[02:51:17]
Just write hundred and seventeen percent vote by mail when you type in like on Twitter, for example, if you put Trump in a hashtag, the things that populate underneath that. Oh my God, it's a C.

[02:51:32]
Yeah. It seems like for Trump lied Trump's evil Trump the white supremacist. But those are the ones that automatically populate. Yeah. Now are they. Project Veritas did a funny thing.

[02:51:44]
They were showing where they knew things were trending throughout the world and here in the United States at the crazy hundreds of thousands of tweets through this hashtag, but none of it we're going to automatically populate in a search under that same thing.

[02:52:01]
Well, there's a real problem with that for sure. The bias on social media is unstoppable.

[02:52:06]
It's not just social media, it's information searches. When you're trying like my my I love my daughter Julia. And she was preparing I think she was sixteen or fifteen. She was preparing for like a debate and she was getting information.

[02:52:20]
And she's just like Googling the stuff.

[02:52:22]
And I was like, so, you know, in college, I was we weren't allowed to do that. And citing our sources, like, they had to be like very specific and how that process works. And, you know, when you do real research check, well, Google is just giving me the information.

[02:52:35]
I was like, no, no, Google's just giving you the information that Google wants you to have check.

[02:52:39]
But I'm just Google, like, she could not compute that the information that she was being given from a search, that it wasn't just a search.

[02:52:46]
Right. And how do you it. Yeah.

[02:52:48]
How do you explain to somebody that the information that they're reading isn't all of the real information?

[02:52:53]
It's only a portion has it takes a long time before you really digest that. YouTube's another weird one where like kind of a hot topic issues from an opposing idea. Those get buried.

[02:53:07]
And how about all these doctors that were against this idea of the pandemic and the lockdown? They were saying we need herd immunity like real doctors. And I don't agree with them. I'm not saying that they're right, but I'm saying that they were all banned. Like some doctors are saying, we use hydrogen hydroxide, chloroquine and jetpacks. And I've had amazing success treating patients, band, video band and the dangerous information. My own doctor, my own doctor said hydroxy chloroquine is fantastic if you catch it early.

[02:53:38]
Yeah, he goes. It really stops the propagation of the disease if you catch it early, but the the a lot of doctors don't stop, but it becomes it becomes political. Brennan's job when he got covid, you know, the doctor said to him, he said, I don't know what your political leanings are, but I really believe in hydroxy chloroquine. And he's like, what the fuck are you saying?

[02:53:56]
My political leanings. How does it have anything to do with my excuse me, the shit that works? I don't want to get sick. He's like, I got covid. And so he got on the Hydroxy Corkman.

[02:54:05]
He was good in three days, like he had the the red pill and the blue pill. And they're both crazy pills.

[02:54:11]
Can I just have what's in the middle. He did that that rational. Reasonable. Well yeah.

[02:54:16]
Give me a purple pill. Yeah. It's a weird fucking time for everything. You don't have to find that Jamie, if you give up. I mean, I found that actually an article from two years ago explaining what how that.

[02:54:28]
No, it was out there. And this video, she's talking about it.

[02:54:31]
I found it in the transcripts, but I'm trying to say that, like, how they found out that there's one hundred and twelve percent of the people that are registered to vote.

[02:54:39]
There's an explanation for it. Oh, people move and they don't fix it like. Right. OK, their address.

[02:54:45]
So her description of it is she's making it seem like it's fraud.

[02:54:49]
It's not fraud. Fraudsters, people involved. It like it doesn't make sense, does it? No, that doesn't make sense. And it just moves on. So it's like it's not that that's fraud.

[02:54:56]
So she's playing a little game. Yeah, that's what she does.

[02:55:00]
Yeah, it's pretty good. There's a whole thing going on today. That trouble was being interviewed by Bob Woodward for his book. Yes. Back in February. He's downplaying or downplaying is the word. It's going all over the Internet is downplaying the. Yeah, the the thing. Yeah. She then said he's not downplaying it when he's on tape saying I'm downplaying it. And now he's coming out saying those words are used on tape. Are not the words I said.

[02:55:25]
It's like, huh? Why didn't she?

[02:55:27]
She said there was also a thing where she was confronted by a press person about that. And she said, read the rest of his quote, the rest of his quote, It wasn't just a yes, I'm down, but because I don't want people to be in a panic about this. But I am concerned, like there was a there was an additional quote.

[02:55:45]
I heard the quote. I wasn't. You have to read it. I heard it. You can hear it. Oh, let's play it. Yeah. It's not ours to play. Oh, well, it's Bob Woodward's. It's like whoever's putting out CNN, Bob Woodward. But it's a isn't the Trump.

[02:55:57]
It's Trump's words. It's not mark tape. This is where we could get into like, oh OK, I get it. I get a book right now. Right. Oh so the book Bob Woodward. I'm just saying it's all how's that guy still alive. So confused. The Watergate guy. Yeah. Must be taking his vitamins. Elon's you got love the D. How old's that dude. Must be old as fuck, right? He was probably in his 40s back in back then.

[02:56:21]
Yeah, seven years ago. So is Biden. No, that's the same age as 78.

[02:56:27]
Mm. Crazy, it is a different time, though, people are living longer. You know, like I know some 77 year olds that you're like, look, Shane, my buddy, his dad is like he's a six pack.

[02:56:42]
He's pushing 70 really like jacked. He's out their barefoot on the lake at like 40 miles an hour.

[02:56:50]
He skis every single morning and wow. All his all his professional bull rider friends, you know, like, yeah.

[02:56:56]
They got gnarled hands from strapping into the bulls for so long, but they're still like chunky shoulders strain next year. Like do this.

[02:57:04]
How old are you look amazing.

[02:57:06]
You know, like I'm, I'm forty one. I'm like these guys like, oh I'm gonna like this and I get this age. Yeah, you can do that. Now in the old days, Mike Tyson, you know. Yeah dude. Listen man, I had him on the podcast like ten months ago and then I had him on the podcast last week and that's two totally different human beings.

[02:57:25]
Yeah, that's a science project right there.

[02:57:27]
Really, there's a lot going on. But you can do that now.

[02:57:29]
Oh, yeah, you could do that. Now I'm telling dude, he looks fucking terrifying. I mean, like ready to go. How old are you. 53.

[02:57:37]
I'm forty one. Fifty three. Do you know anybody that looked at you when you grew up. That was 53 three.

[02:57:42]
No. They were all dead right then. They weren't Jack. Yeah. So like I remember forty my dad's fortieth birthday and all his forty year old friends were there.

[02:57:50]
And not to talk disparagingly about my dad's friends, but, you know, there were beer bellies, you know, and guys kind of hanging out, talking war stories of, you know, their glory days in college athletics. Now, you look like my friends.

[02:58:04]
They're all forties and you're like pretty fit. Jack.

[02:58:08]
Yeah, Jack. Muscular, healthy, fast. You know, like the kids want to go play ball and they're like, yeah, try to keep up, boy.

[02:58:16]
Well, people know the benefit of exercise for overall health when you get older. Now, they didn't nobody fucking worked out in the fifties and sixties.

[02:58:25]
They barely worked. They worked out of there doing a sport. And once they were doing the sport, they didn't do shit.

[02:58:28]
I'm going to be a freak till I die. Yes, yes, yes. Where the grave. You're like, OK, yeah.

[02:58:33]
What is wrong with this guy Cinergy? Why is he trying so much that I'm still going? Have people come to sheepdog response. You like the 70 year old just out shot me.

[02:58:41]
Exactly. Yeah. When people talk to me about like, you know, what supplements you take, um, like all of them, whatever works, what's working, tell me what works. I'll get people on. Tell me what's work. I'll take that. Yeah. What works. What works. No, I'm, I'm just trying to stay.

[02:58:54]
Jack, I want to keep moving. Yeah.

[02:58:57]
High libido, high energy. I want a ton of fun and I want people to be like, how do I keep up rage.

[02:59:04]
Rage against the dying of the light. I'm not going softly fuck. Once more time into the fray will go.

[02:59:10]
Yeah, I don't I don't think you people know what it's like to be both either.

[02:59:14]
People know what it's like to be tired and weak or they know what it's like to be strong, you know, but when you've been both when you really when you really know where it can slide into. And the only way you know that is if you've been strong and most people never really get there.

[02:59:27]
But when you get strong and then maybe you get a little bit sick or maybe get injured and you go, fuck, once this ACL heals up, I'm getting back after it feels so good.

[02:59:35]
Yes, yes.

[02:59:38]
The you know, the I wasn't joking about the transformation. I jamina a couple of these courses.

[02:59:46]
Jamie's going to be shooting people. He's going to be busy. Can you believe you have a gun. So yeah.

[02:59:52]
You got one right there. Well, I don't know about the shooting people. He's ready. Yeah, he's ready.

[02:59:57]
But like, you get this this contagious itch. Yeah.

[03:00:01]
You know, and like, you scratch the surface and then you see what's on the other side. You're like, oh, and then you scratch a little bit more and you see like how fun and like food tastes better. Sex is more fun. You like work is easier. Yeah. Everything just gets better and they like you then then you're in like now. Now you're hooked. Yeah.

[03:00:19]
And then but that process is, is like, you know, a calloused hand, you know, chunky years. Yeah.

[03:00:26]
But man it's worth, it's all worth it. So I fucking preach it, preach it, preach it from the rooftops.

[03:00:33]
But hey get that heat out. Get the hate.

[03:00:35]
Yeah. That does not help. Doesn't help anything. It doesn't help you either. Solution oriented. It's the only poison that kills the vessel.

[03:00:42]
It's containing it. All of that. Yeah. It's, it's fucking terrible for you and it erodes everything physically, mentally and everything.

[03:00:50]
I posted a picture on Instagram and it was, it was off of and no, he just took all the mug shots of everybody that had been arrested.

[03:00:59]
They all look like shit so bad.

[03:01:01]
I mean, bad skin, sunken eyes, weird hair lines, like multiple colors, you know, like a bad tattoo.

[03:01:10]
Every bad thing that you could see visually about a person was in a lot of people were like they it looks like they have some mental health issues. And I don't know how you see mental health issues in people, but there is like a you don't let yourself look like that unless there's a problem.

[03:01:26]
You see the video, the woman who was saying. I don't give a fuck that a fascist died tonight. See that video from Portland after the guy got shot and killed? Oh, no. Building a pair big fat, sloppy lady with fucking sweatpants on. And I'm like, of course you don't care. You don't even care about your own body. You don't care about yourself. You don't care about your life. You found a microphone. You got a microphone now and you're yelling it out because you've got a whole bunch of other losers who'd gathered together and you could say nonsense and they all cheer.

[03:01:53]
But I want all of those people on this side like I. I feel sorry for her. I pity her.

[03:01:58]
I want to go take her by the hand. I want to walk a couple of blocks with her. I want to pick a couple of meals for her. Then I want to get up the next day and walk four blocks with her and then pick a few more meals with her and then like everything starts getting better.

[03:02:09]
The problem is she'd have to let go and realize that she's wrong. She's a little overweight, like overweight, let go of what she's done.

[03:02:16]
Let go the path, let go of what you've done with your body, what you've done with your brain, let go of the path that you've been on and recognize you're a human being and you can change, learn and grow. But you got to recognize this is cheering for someone who got murdered in the street, you should be like, this is not what we're about. This is all wrong. Saying I don't give a fuck of a fascist died tonight like, no, that guy who you think is a fascist is a human being.

[03:02:39]
He might have a child. He might have a wife. He might he definitely has a mom and a dad like this is not right. No, this is not how we're supposed to be. We're supposed to be a community. America is supposed to be a community.

[03:02:50]
And if we disagree or we agree, we're supposed to work it out. We're not supposed to be shooting at each other in the streets over fucking nonsense. And you're not supposed to be cheering about it with a bunch of other losers. That's not what this is supposed to be about. And no and no one is doing a goddamn thing about it in Portland. They're just letting it go. That fucking mayor is an idiot. Jesus Christ. Is he bad?

[03:03:10]
I loved Portland. It's amazing. Ten years ago. I love visiting there. I was there before the pandemic. Really? I did the Moda Center there. We do fucking great, though. I love great fans.

[03:03:22]
Fuck yeah. They got great everything. You got food truck. The people are cool.

[03:03:25]
We run a course there a few times a year and we always loved the guys.

[03:03:30]
The instructor is always like I wanted to do the Portland one because like the the bee and bees are cool.

[03:03:34]
You got all the water, everything's gorgeous, all the food's fantastic.

[03:03:38]
And like Oregon, really, the whole northwest Washington, Northern California and Oregon, like, they're cool people, you know, they're like they're kind of kind of hippie, but also kind of like about health and about freedom.

[03:03:53]
But they're also made a little progressive and some of their social ideas. But they want to be left alone. So it's to cool people. Yeah. And it's it's a ton of fun. But now we're like, can we run a course in Portland?

[03:04:05]
Can we use a small amount of people? Man It's a small percentage of the millions of people that live up there.

[03:04:11]
Yeah, it's a small, loud, angry, fucked up group of people where the majority needs to step up.

[03:04:17]
And they're kind of trying. They're trying. You know, there's a lot of people that are very upset about what's going on and trying to figure out some way to get the mayor to act or get the state police to act or get someone to act as more than 100 days of protest.

[03:04:31]
I love the lawsuits that are starting to pop up by business owners. Yeah, what was that? That the district in Seattle or they're like, oh, yeah.

[03:04:40]
Oh, yeah, Jetseta, that's a bunch of people are suing the city and the state for not providing the services that they paid by taxes and legislation they're supposed to have.

[03:04:54]
So their businesses were burnt, all because they're saying that the the local government was complicit in letting these things happen by not protecting, by not having police come and say, no, you can't do this.

[03:05:06]
There's a law that prohibits you from Becka's. A guy has a cell phone and you don't know who that guy is. You don't get to go beat him. Right?

[03:05:13]
Like, I don't have control of this business. I'm going to go smash the windows and burn it down.

[03:05:18]
All those things are happening within that as well.

[03:05:22]
Like, well, there's laws against that, right? That's arson and that's assaults. And but you guys weren't enforcing any of these.

[03:05:27]
So the lawsuit is that these people are complicit and it's like it's going to be one of them was a father of a murdered kid, is suing the I think the the city of Seattle for allowing that to happen.

[03:05:42]
Well. Heavy stuff that's heavy, yeah, there's rule of law for a reason. Security, stability, there is. It's like, you know, this is a funny thing that Trump does or he tweets law and order all the time, like every few days, law and order, all caps.

[03:05:56]
But he's right. You need that. That's how you have safety. That's how you have peace. What's that?

[03:06:01]
The movie where you get like a knight to go crazy and like, purge value. Yeah.

[03:06:08]
Tell me that didn't inspire a lot of these fucks. The dead for sure. Yeah. Yeah. And you actually see like tactics that were used in that movie being used in a sometimes Hollywood is is, is, is more real than fiction.

[03:06:23]
And that's what happened.

[03:06:25]
They took what they were watching like oh we can go and do this. No, you can't and don't try it in Texas. No, that's that's a terrible idea. It's a bad idea, especially what you're saying about all the special ops guys that are here. So many enjoy their cigars.

[03:06:41]
They had another juice. Yeah, everybody loves you. It's funny. Thanks, man. I love them, too. Yeah.

[03:06:50]
Listen, dude, we're already more than three hours in here. Holy crap.

[03:06:54]
Believe that. How do you have a clue how fast this time fly.

[03:06:57]
No, I was looking at that school and be like that.

[03:06:59]

[03:07:59]
We had to put this fucking place together. I had to move in. There was a lot going on. I mean, I literally decided to move and was moved in in a month.

[03:08:07]
That's insane. Yeah. So cool. Yeah. Bought a house in less than a month. I was like, let's do it. Let's go to my wife and kids were in. I was like, let's fucking go out. Yeah.
