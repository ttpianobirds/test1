Introduction





Your Vocabulary Has Been Talking About You Behind Your Back


The words you use say a lot about you. Knowing which words to use and understanding how to use them are both key to communicating effectively and accurately. People often say in frustration, “I know what I mean, but I don’t know how to say it.” If the right words aren’t there, the right ideas can’t get through. Your vocabulary is the foundation of your ability to share your thoughts with other people. When you improve your vocabulary, you improve your ability to bring your intelligence and ideas to bear on the world around you.





“Big” Words Aren’t Necessarily Better


When people say that someone has a “good vocabulary,” they usually mean that he or she uses a lot of important-sounding words—words like jactitation, demulcent, and saxicolous. But a vocabulary consisting of words like these isn’t necessarily a “good” vocabulary. Why?

Because almost no one knows what jactitation, demulcent, and saxicolous mean. If you used these words in conversation, chances are no one listening to you would know what you were talking about. Big, difficult words have important uses, but improving a vocabulary involves much more than merely decorating your speech or your writing with a few polysyllabic zingers.

The goal of communication is clarity. We write and speak in order to make ourselves understood. A good vocabulary is one that makes communication easy and efficient. One mark of an effective speaker or writer is his or her ability to express complex ideas with relatively simple words.

Most discourse among educated people is built on words that are fairly ordinary—words you’ve heard before, even if you aren’t exactly certain what they mean. The best way to improve your vocabulary isn’t to comb the dictionary for a handful of tongue twisters to throw at unsuspecting strangers. Instead, you need to hone your understanding of words that turn up again and again in intelligent communication. A person who had a clear understanding of every word in an issue of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal would have a powerful vocabulary—a vocabulary sophisticated enough to impress almost any teacher, admissions officer, colleague, or employer.





Why You Need This Book


An effective vocabulary is one that enables you to convey ideas easily. Do you know what inveterate means? Do you know the difference between flaunt and flout? Do you know why an artist might be insulted if you called his or her work artful?

None of these words is particularly difficult. But each has its own meaning or meanings. If you misuse these words, you communicate that you are in over your head.

When people get into trouble with words, it usually isn’t because they don’t know the meaning of a seldom-used word like termagant but because they are confused about the meaning of a much more common word—a word they hear, read, and even use with regularity.

Take the word peruse, for example. Many people think that it means “skim” or “glance over.” But it doesn’t. In fact, it means very nearly the opposite. To peruse a document is to read it carefully.

The number of words you know is less important than the care you take in learning the ones you really use. Speaking or writing well doesn’t require an enormous vocabulary—but it does require a confident one. And the way to gain confidence in your vocabulary is to buckle down and learn the words you need to make yourself clearly understood.





The Princeton Review Approach


The philosophy behind The Princeton Review is simple: We teach what you need to know and try to make it interesting and fun at the same time. In preparing students for various standardized tests, we spend much of our time working on vocabulary. Despite what many people think, many “intelligence” or “aptitude” tests are largely tests of vocabulary. The students who earn high scores on such tests are the students who know the right words. The success of our method is in part a result of our success in teaching vocabulary.

The methods we have developed are easy to use and, we believe, extremely effective. There’s nothing particularly startling about them because they rely mostly on common sense, but they do work. And although they were developed primarily for students, these methods can be used by anyone who wants to build a stronger, smarter vocabulary.





How This Book Is Organized


This book is divided into three main sections. In Chapter 1, we describe some basic principles of vocabulary building. We also explain techniques for learning new words. You should apply these techniques as you work through the rest of the book. The more carefully you work, the more rapidly you’ll enhance your ability to use words effectively.

The heart of Word Smart is Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 2 is the largest section of the book, containing all of the words we think the savvy student should know. Each word is accompanied by a definition and one or more examples intended to help you understand how to use the word properly. Many entries also include discussions of related words as well as additional meanings or associations. Scattered throughout the book are quick quizzes that will help you strengthen your vocabulary skills and assess your progress as you work. The answers to these quick quizzes are found in Chapter 13.

Chapter 3 consists of “The Final Exam” covering all the words in Chapter 2. You can use this test to help firm up your new vocabulary knowledge and to help ensure that you’ll retain all the new words you’ve learned. You can also use the test as a diagnostic tool. By trying your hand at the questions before working your way through the book, you’ll give yourself a good idea of which words cause you the most trouble. And if you’re preparing for a major standardized test such as the SAT or GRE, you and your friends can use the Final Exam as a handy review device. All of the answers to the drills in this section can be found in Chapter 13.

The third and final section of this book, Chapters 4 through 12, contain specialized lists of words, including need-to-know words for the SAT and GRE. These lists, which contain the most frequently tested (or appearing) words on the SAT and GRE, are the ones we use to help students boost their verbal scores on these exams. Sometimes simply knowing that a particular word is included on one of these lists is enough to lead students to a correct answer on the test.

Other specialized lists include frequently misused words, useful foreign words and phrases, common abbreviations, and words associated with science, finance, and the arts. If you learn the words on these lists, you’ll improve your reading comprehension as well as increase your understanding of various disciplines.





How to Use This Book


Don’t try to read this book in a single sitting. You’ll learn much more if you tackle it a little at a time. You may feel comfortable with a number of the words already. You don’t need to spend much time on those, but be certain you really do know a word as well as you think you do before you skip ahead. Some of the most embarrassing vocabulary blunders occur when we boldly misuse words we feel certain we understand.

The words in Word Smart are arranged alphabetically. You’ll find a Quick Quiz every 10 words or so. You may find it convenient to tackle words in the main list in 10-word chunks, pausing at each Quick Quiz to make certain you have retained what you just learned. Don’t forget to check your answers.

If you’re trying to build your vocabulary in preparation for a test, you should set a schedule for yourself and work methodically from beginning to end. If you’re simply trying to improve your vocabulary, you may find it more interesting to dip into the text at random. You can also use the book as a companion to your dictionary to zero in on the meanings of new words you’ve encountered in reading or in conversation.

When you finish this book, you will have a solid vocabulary that can help you in every facet of your life—studying in a classroom, communicating at work, even kicking back with a book on your couch. But don’t stop there. Continue to expand your vocabulary by mastering the new words you encounter.

Let’s begin!





CHAPTER 1


Learning New Words





Building a Vocabulary Is Child’s Play


Young children learn new words by imitating the speakers around them. When a three-year-old hears a new word that catches her interest, she may use it repeatedly for a day or two until she feels comfortable with it. She establishes its meaning from context, often by trial and error. She adds new words to her vocabulary because she needs them to make herself understood.

Children have an easier time learning new words than most adults do. As we grow beyond childhood, our brains seem to lose their magical ability to soak up language from the environment. But adults can still learn a great deal from the way children learn new words.

Young children don’t learn the meanings of new words by looking them up. Sometimes they ask grown-ups directly, but more often they simply infer meanings from context. They figure out what new words mean by paying attention to how they are used.

You need to do the same. Be receptive to new words by actively seeking to understand them. When you encounter an unfamiliar word in the newspaper, don’t skim over it. Stop and try to figure out what it means. The words that surround it should provide a few clues. Put your mind to work.





A Word Is Useful Only If You Use It


Children learn words by using them. Adults who want to build their vocabularies must do the same. You can’t incorporate a new word into your vocabulary unless you give it a thorough workout and then keep it in shape through regular exercise. Use new words over and over—at the dinner table, at school, in conversation with friends—even at the risk of making mistakes.

If you are a student preparing to enter college or graduate school, learning new words can help you perform better on tests like the SAT and GRE, improving your chances of being admitted to more competitive schools. An added bonus is that your writing and speaking skills will improve along with your vocabulary, which can help you in your classes as well. Nonstudents may have other vocabulary needs, but the same general rules apply. As with many other things, you have to use vocabulary if you don’t want to lose it. Remember that the size and quality of a person’s vocabulary correlate powerfully with his or her success in school, at work, and beyond.





Read, Read, Read!


The best way to build a solid, sophisticated vocabulary is to read voraciously. Careful reading not only brings you into contact with new words but also forces you to use your brain to figure out what those new words mean. If you read widely enough, you will find that your vocabulary will build itself. New words are contagious if you give yourself enough exposure to them. Reading any good book is better for your vocabulary than watching television. Reading well-written magazines and newspapers can help, too.





Use a Dictionary


When you read, you will undoubtedly come across words you don’t know, and some will be critical to the meaning of the passages in which they appear. If you’re serious about understanding what you read, as well as improving your vocabulary, you’ll have to use the dictionary.

The natural way to learn words is to see how other people use them—that is, to see or hear the word in context. While context may tell you how to use the word, relying on context is not without pitfalls.

First, when you hear a new word, you can’t be certain the speaker’s pronunciation is correct. You also can’t be certain the word is being used correctly. Even skillful writers and speakers occasionally misuse language. A writer or speaker may even misuse a word intentionally, perhaps for dramatic or comic effect.

Even more important, many words have multiple meanings and connotations. Sometimes the difference between one meaning and another is slight; sometimes it is significant. Even if you deduce the meaning from the context, you have no way of knowing whether the meaning you’ve deduced will apply in other cases.

Finally, context can be misleading. Take the word formidable, for example. When you hear this word, you may think of it in the context of “a formidable opponent.” This might lead you to believe that formidable means something like “skillful” or “aggressive.” But those definitions miss the mark, as formidable actually means “frightening” or “menacing.” See how context can be misleading?

The point here is to understand the limits of context and always consult a dictionary if you’re not sure of the meaning of a word.





Which Dictionary Should You Use?


Like cars, not all dictionaries have the same features. Dictionaries can range from children’s editions with lots of pictures to humongous, unabridged dictionaries with lots of entries in tiny type. (By the way, abridged means “shortened.” An unabridged dictionary is one that includes almost every single word in the English language!) And then there’s the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary.

For most people, however, a good college-edition dictionary is sufficient. (A “college” dictionary is not for use in college only; the phrase “college dictionary” is simply a rough indication of the vocabulary level of the readers for whom the dictionary is appropriate.)

We encourage you to get in the habit of carrying a portable dictionary with you wherever you go, so that when you encounter a word you don’t know, you can look it up on the spot. Of course, we don’t expect you to lug around a huge hardcover dictionary; try a small paperback copy or even a dictionary app that can be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet. We recommend using a hard-copy dictionary, as looking up a word in a real book creates a tactile memory so that you will have a better chance of remembering the meaning of the word. But ultimately, you should you use the dictionary that works best for you; that’s the best approach for getting words to stick.





What Are the Features of a Good Dictionary?


We used several dictionaries in verifying the definitions and usages that appear in Word Smart. Let’s take a look at a sample dictionary entry:

a•bridge (ə brij’), v.t., a•bridged, a•bridg•ing. 1. to shorten by condensation or omission while retaining the basic contents: to abridge a long novel. 2. to reduce or lessen in duration, scope, etc.; diminish, curtail. 3. to deprive; cut off [1350–1400; ME abregge, abrigge < MF abreg(i)er < ML abbreviare to shorten. See ABBREVIATE] —a•bridg’a•ble; esp. Brit., a•bridg’á•ble, adj.— a•bridg’ér, n. —Syn.1. condense, abstract. See shorten. 2. contract.



Now let’s examine this entry part by part:

a•bridge

The main entry—the dot separates the words into syllables. Sometimes the main entry includes stress marks to tell you which syllables to stress in pronouncing the word.



(əbrij’)

The pronunciation—every dictionary includes a pronunciation key up front to explain symbols like the upside-down e known as a schwa and pronounced “uh.” If a word has more than one acceptable pronunciation, the entry will list them.

Always observe the pronunciation of a word when you look it up. If you know how to pronounce a word, you’re more likely to use it. (If you don’t know how to pronounce a word, you’re more likely to embarrass yourself at cocktail parties.) And the more you use a word, the more likely you’ll be able to remember it.



v.t.

Part of speech—this abbreviation means that abridge is a verb, specifically a transitive verb.

A transitive verb is one that carries action from a subject to a direct object. For example, in the sentence The dog ate the book, the verb ate carries action from the dog to the book. Similarly, in The editor abridged the book, the verb abridged carries action from the editor to the book.

An example of an intransitive verb is to sleep. In The dog sleeps, the verb does not carry any action from the subject (dog) to any other thing.



a•bridged, a•bridg•ing

Forms—these entries let us know that we should note the spellings of different forms of the word abridge. Notice, for example, that we drop the e before adding ing.



1. to shorten by condensation or omission while retaining the basic contents: to abridge a long novel.

The most common definition of the word. Some dictionaries include helpful phrases or sentences to show you how to use the word in context.

This feature is quite useful. The example tells us that we would not use abridge this way: The tailor abridged Susan’s long skirt to make it a mini.



2. to reduce or lessen in duration, scope, etc.; diminish, curtail. 3. to deprive; cut off.

Other definitions, generally in order of importance—sometimes a definition will include close synonyms.



[1350–1400; ME abregge, abrigge < MF abreg(i)er < ML abbreviare to shorten. See ABBREVIATE]

The etymology—some dictionaries include the etymology before the definitions.

You don’t have to be a linguist, but the word abridge developed from medieval Latin to Middle French to Middle English: abbreviare (meaning “to shorten”), in medieval Latin became abreg(i)er in Middle French, which became abregge or abrigge in Middle English, which finally became abridge.

The etymology suggests that we look up abbreviate. If you have the time, you should do so. It will reinforce your understanding of abridge.

We will discuss etymology in more detail later because it is a powerful mnemonic. (Look it up!)



—a•bridg’a•ble; esp. Brit., a•bridge’á•ble, adj. —a•bridg’ér, n.

Other parts of speech, along with an alternative (British) spelling.



—Syn. 1. condense, abstract. See shorten. 2. contract.

An abridged (!) list of synonyms—the numbers refer to the preceding order of definitions. The entry suggests that we look up shorten. Not all dictionaries include this feature, though.





Don’t Stop with the Definition


The editors of the dictionary advise us to look up shorten if we want a better understanding of abridge, so let’s do just that:

short•en (shôr’tən), v.t., 1. to make short or shorter. 2. to reduce, decrease, take in, etc.: to shorten sail. 3. to make (pastry, bread, etc.) short, as with butter or other fat. —v.i. 4. to become short or shorter. 5. (of odds) to decrease. —short’ener, n. —Syn. SHORTEN, ABBREVIATE, ABRIDGE, CURTAIL mean to make shorter or briefer. SHORTEN is a general word meaning to make less in extent or duration: to shorten a dress, a prisoner’s sentence. The other three words suggest methods of shortening. TO ABBREVIATE is to make shorter by omission or contraction: to abbreviate a word. TO ABRIDGE is to reduce in length or size by condensing, summarizing, and the like: to abridge a document. CURTAIL suggests deprivation and lack of completeness because of cutting off part: to curtail an explanation.



This entry distinguishes shorten from a number of synonyms, including abridge. The digression took another minute or so, but we’ve come away with a better understanding of the meanings and their nuances. (Look it up!) We will consider synonyms in detail when we discuss how to use a thesaurus.





Why Don’t Entries in Word Smart Look Like Standard Dictionary Entries?


We’ve tried to make Word Smart easier to read and understand than a big dictionary.

Don’t get us wrong. We use dictionaries, we rely on dictionaries, but sometimes we wish that lexicographers (those fun-loving people who write dictionaries) would communicate in basic English.

For each word in Word Smart, we give you a basic definition. Sometimes a close synonym is enough. Then we give you—and this is important—a sentence or two so that you can see how to use the word. Our entry for abridge reads as follows:

ABRIDGE (uh BRIJ) v to shorten; to condense

• The thoughtful editor abridged the massive book by removing the boring parts.

An abridged dictionary is one that has been shortened to keep it from crushing desks and people’s laps.

 An abridgment is a shortened or condensed work.



The problem with most dictionaries is that they don’t tell you how to use the word. You can always spot someone who has learned new words almost exclusively through the dictionary rather than through general reading supplemented with a dictionary. When you ask such people the definition of a word, it’s almost as if they fall into a trance—their eyes glaze over as they rattle off the definition almost word for word from a dictionary.

So while it’s important to use a dictionary, it’s also important to think critically about the words as well, because…

You will not truly learn a word unless you can define it in your own words.

To understand a word completely, to make a word yours, you should try to define it in your own words. Don’t settle for the dictionary definition. For that matter, don’t settle for our definition.

Make up your own definition. You’ll understand the meaning better. What’s more, you’ll be more likely to remember it.





Thesauruses: Don’t Misuse, Abuse, Exploit, Corrupt, Misapply, or Misemploy Them


A thesaurus is a dictionary-like reference book that lists synonyms for many words. A thesaurus can be another useful tool in your word-building campaign, but only if you use it properly. Many people don’t.

Thesaurus abuse is common. Students often try to make their vocabularies seem bigger than they actually are by using a thesaurus to beef up the papers they write. (Neophytes chronically endeavor to induce their parlance to portend more magisterially by employing a lexicon of synonyms to amplify the theses they inscribe.) They write their papers in their own words, and then they plug in words from a thesaurus. That’s what we did with the silly-sounding sentence in the parentheses above. You’d be surprised how many students actually compose their papers that way.





Still, a Thesaurus Can Be Useful


A thesaurus can be helpful—if you use it properly.

The best way to use a thesaurus is as a supplement to your dictionary, as a reference work that can help you find the word that expresses precisely what you are trying to say. A good thesaurus is intended to help a speaker or writer distinguish the shades of difference between words of similar meaning.





How to Use the Thesaurus: An Example


Let’s say you’re trying to describe Randolph, someone who never lends money to anyone. Randolph examines his monthly bank statement with a calculator to make sure that his interest has been properly computed to the penny. Randolph is someone who would have to think long and hard if a mugger presented him with the dilemma “Your money or your life.”

The first word that comes to mind in describing Randolph may be cheap. Being the careful writer you are, you decide to see whether cheap is the most precise word you can come up with.

In your thesaurus, you find the following entry:

cheap adj. 1. Chicken is not as cheap as it was: inexpensive, low-priced, economical, reasonable. 2. Talk is cheap: effortless, costless, easy. 3. The coat may be expensive, but it looks cheap: shoddy, shabby, inferior, worthless, poor, second-rate, trashy, meager, paltry, gimcrack, flashy, gaudy, in bad taste, tawdry, tacky, common, inelegant. 4. Spreading gossip is a cheap thing to do: contemptible, petty, despicable, sordid, ignoble, wretched, mean, base. Slang: two-bit, vulgar, immoral, indecent. 5. He’s too cheap to pick up the check: tight,



The entry cheap lists five primary meanings, each preceded by an illustrative sentence. You scan the sentences until you find the one you want: the last one. Now you examine the synonyms.

tight: Okay, but perhaps it’s too informal or colloquial—might be confused with other definitions of the word tight. Forget this one.



stingy: A possibility.



miserly: Let’s say you’re not exactly sure what this one means. You decide to look this one up in the regular dictionary.



penurious: Better look this one up, too.



tightfisted: A little better than tight, though perhaps still too slangy—you’ll think about it.



close: Nope—too many other definitions.



Before leaving the thesaurus, however, you decide to check out the listing for miserly and come up with the following additional words:

parsimonious: Look it up.



avaricious: Look it up.



mean: Too many other definitions.



grasping: More a synonym of greedy. Randolph isn’t precisely greedy. He doesn’t want to accumulate a lot; he just wants to hold on to what he has. Forget this one.



scrimping: Doesn’t sound right—forget this one.



pinching: Nope.



penny-pinching: Better than pinching alone, but colloquial—maybe.



frugal: Look it up.



illiberal: Too vague.



closehanded: Nah.



closefisted: Similar to tightfisted and penny-pinching, but not as good—drop.



selfish: Too general—Randolph is selfish only with money.



ungenerous: Nope—Randolph isn’t particularly generous, but you want to say what he is rather than what he is not.



greedy: You ruled this out earlier.



niggardly: Look it up.



near: Nope.



meager: Look it up.



grudging: Not precisely what you mean.



You decide you have enough synonyms to work with. Now you have to look up and verify definitions.

You are left with three synonyms you know (stingy, tightfisted, and penny-pinching) and seven you don’t know. Just to be orderly, you look up the seven words alphabetically in your dictionary:

avaricious characterized by avarice (insatiable greed for riches; inordinate desire to gain and hoard wealth); covetous



Nope, you don’t mean greedy. Avaricious is out.

frugal 1. economical in use or expenditure; prudently saving or sparing. 2. entailing little expense; requiring few resources; meager, scanty.



The first definition means careful with money. Economical and prudent both have positive connotations, but Randolph’s obsession with money is not something good. The second definition is not the one we want—out.

meager 1. deficient in quantity or quality; lacking fullness or richness; poor; scanty. 2. having little flesh; lean; thin. 3. maigre.



Nope, none of these seems to convey the meaning you want.

miserly of, like, or befitting a miser (one who lives in wretched circumstances in order to save and hoard money); penurious; niggardly.



Well, this might be right. You have to think about Randolph a little more. What are his circumstances like? Is he willing to live in wretched circumstances?

niggardly reluctant to give or spend; stingy. —Syn. 1. penurious, miserly.



It’s a possiblity. Let’s take a look at the last few before you decide.

parsimonious characterized by or showing parsimony; sparing or frugal, esp. to excess.



Now you have established that parsimonious means stingier than frugal. This seems to hit the mark.

penurious 1. extremely stingy. 2. extremely poor; indigent. 3. poorly or inadequately supplied.



The first definition works, but the second definition seems to imply a stinginess perhaps resulting from poverty. The third definition does not apply. Now you have to think again about Randolph. Is he poor as well as cheap? If so, this is the right word.

You’re still left with stingy, tightfisted, penny-pinching, miserly, niggardly, parsimonious, and penurious. Oh, and there’s still the blunt, if unassuming, cheap, which you started with. Which word is the right word?

Stingy is the right word if you want to use a simple, no-nonsense word.

Tightfisted is the word if you want something a little more slangy and graphic.

Penny-pinching is right if you want the image to be a little more explicit than tightfisted.

Miserly could be the right word, depending on Randolph’s living circumstances.

Niggardly is the right word if Randolph is merely reluctant to spend money. If he’s more than reluctant, this isn’t the right word.

Parsimonious is the right word if you want a multisyllabic synonym for cheap or stingy. From the definitions, parsimonious seems more extreme than stingy.

Penurious is the right word if Randolph is poor as well as stingy.

To decide which word is the right word, you must give more thought to precisely what aspect of Randolph you’re trying to capture and convey.

The right word is not merely the accurate word with the proper connotations.

We don’t want to get into writing style, but other considerations to keep in mind when choosing the right word include the following:

Rhythm, or Cadence

Which word best fits in with the overall flow of the sentence and paragraph? Perhaps you want to achieve alliteration (Randolph is a pretentious, penny-pinching poet) or a certain rhyme (Alimony drove Randolph to parsimony).

Part of Speech

Miserly seems okay as an adjective, but miserliness seems a little awkward as a noun.

Vocabulary Level

Who will read your description of Randolph? Your word choice may be limited by your potential reader or audience. Other things being equal, the simple word is the better word.

Variety

If you’ve used cheap several times already in the same piece of writing, you may want to use a different word.

Repetition

On the other hand, repeating the same word may have a powerful effect.

Dramatic Effect

A simple word in an academic setting, or an academic word in a simple setting, can have a dramatic effect. Comic effects can also be achieved by using a word in an inappropriate or incongruous context.





Editing Is More Than Choosing the Right Word


Word Smart is a book on words rather than on writing. Still, we want to note in passing that good editing is more than simply reviewing the words you use.

Editing means refining your ideas. Editing means deciding on the ordering and presentation of your ideas. Editing means deciding which ideas you’re going to present at all.





Which Thesaurus Should I Use?


We recommend that the thesaurus you use be one that lists words alphabetically in the text itself. Ideally, the thesaurus should include sample sentences that distinguish at least some of the different shades of meanings.





Reading This Book


Reading widely—with the help of a dictionary and perhaps also a thesaurus—is a great way to build a vocabulary. But it’s also a slow way. Which words you encounter in your reading depend on which words the writers happen to use.

That’s where we come in. The main section of Word Smart is a concentrated source of the words you want to know—the words you need to help yourself build an educated vocabulary. We’ve also included fun facts, etymology, and usage, which are integral to the vocabulary learning methods you’re about to encounter. If you want a better vocabulary, you have to put the time and effort in.

As you work through this book, you’ll undoubtedly find that you need to tailor your approach to the way you think and learn best. You may discover that for a particular word one method works best and that for another word a different method works best. That’s fine.

The best method for memorizing words is the method that works best for you.

We’ll show you the methods we have found to be the most successful for our students. Use the one or ones that suit you best.





Basic Method #1: Tricks and Mnemonics


A mnemonic is a device or trick that helps you remember something specific. Grade schoolers are sometimes taught to remember the spelling of arithmetic by using the following mnemonic: A Rat In The House Might Eat Tom’s Ice Cream. The first letter in each word in this silly sentence stands for the letters in arithmetic. Remember the sentence and you remember how to spell the word.

Mnemonics can appeal to our ears, too. How about the history mnemonic: In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue…? Or the spelling mnemonic: i before e except after c, and in words that say a, as in neighbor and weigh?

You Already Know How to Use Mnemonics

Whether you realize it or not, you use mnemonics all the time. When you make up a little game to remember your locker combination or a friend’s birthday, you’re using a mnemonic.

How Do Mnemonics Work?

All mnemonics work in the same way: they force you to associate what you’re trying to remember with something that you already know, or with something that is easier to memorize. Patterns and rhymes are easy to memorize, which explains why so many mnemonics use them.

Incidentally, it may also explain why rhyming became a part of poetry. The earliest poets and balladeers didn’t write down their compositions because many didn’t know how to write. Instead, they kept the poems in their heads. Among other things, the rhymes at the ends of the lines made the poems easier to remember.





Basic Method #2: Seeing Is Remembering


Letting a new word suggest a vivid mental image to you is a powerful and effective way to remember that word. Mental images are really mnemonics, too. They help you remember. The emphasis here is on suggestive mental pictures rather than on tricky abbreviations or coincidences of spelling.

Let’s look at an example. We’ll start with a word we’ve already used in this chapter: abridge. As you know, to abridge is to shorten or condense.

What image pops into your mind when you think of the word abridge? That’s easy: a bridge. Now you need to picture something happening on or to that bridge that will help you remember the meaning of the word abridge. Your goal is to create such a vivid and memorable image in your mind that the next time you encounter abridge in your reading, you’ll instantly remember what it means.

To be useful, your image must have something to do with the meaning of the word rather than merely with the way it sounds or looks. If you merely think of a bridge when you see abridge, you won’t help yourself remember what you want to remember.

What you need is an image that suggests shortening or condensing. A dinosaur taking a big bite out of the middle of a bridge? Carpenters sawing it? The image you choose is up to you.

And Now for Another Example…

Another useful word is gregarious, which means sociable, enjoying the company of others. What image springs to mind? Really think now.

Can’t think of an image? Be creative. A party animal is gregarious. How about imagining a party animal named Greg Arious. Don’t stop with his name. You need a picture. So give Greg a funny hat, a noisemaker, and some polka-dot dancing shoes. Or put a lampshade on his head. Think of something that will make you think of sociability the next time you see Greg’s name in a book or a magazine you read. The more real you make Greg Arious seem in your imagination, the less trouble you’ll have remembering the meaning of gregarious.

The Crazier the Mental Image, the Better

It’s better to choose an interesting mental image that you’ll remember. If you choose an image that is bland or boring, you may have trouble remembering the word. Interesting, even weird, mental images are more likely to stick in your memory.

Memory Aids Should Be Personal

Sometimes we’ll give you a mnemonic for the listings in Word Smart, but we won’t do this very often. Memory aids work best when you have to struggle a little to come up with them.

If you come up with your own memory aid, if it really means something to you, it will likely become a permanent part of your memory.





Basic Method #3: Etymological Clues


Although the English language contains hundreds of thousands of words, you will discover that many groups of words are related in meaning because they developed from a common root. When you recognize that a group of words shares a similar root, you will more easily remember the entire group.

For example, take the word mnemonic. You know now, if you hadn’t already, that a mnemonic is a device that helps you remember something. We’re going to show you two other words that are related to this word.

mnemonic: device to help you remember something

amnesty: a general pardon for offenses against a government (an official “forgetting”)

amnesia: loss of memory



Pretty neat, eh? How about words from another common root:

chronological: in order according to time

synchronize: to put on the same timetable

anachronism: something out of place in time or history

chronic: continuing over a long time

chronicle: chronological record of events

chronometer: device to measure time



Sometimes it is easier to learn a whole cluster of related words than to come up with mnemonics for them individually.

The Advantages of Etymology

Learning word roots is a key part of etymology, the study of the origin of words and how their meanings have changed over time. A word’s etymology tells you something about the meaning of the word. Additionally, etymology can be shared among several words, which can help you remember the meanings of clusters of related words. Learning etymology can also get you interested in the origin of words and language in general; etymology tells you the story of a word over centuries. In Chapter 6 you will find a list of the most important roots with numerous examples following each.

The Pitfalls of Etymology

The etymology of a word will tell you something about the word, but it will rarely give you the full definition. Students often confuse a word’s etymology with its meaning, which can lead to errors on tests.

Take the word verdant, for example. At first glance, you may think this word is etymologically related to words like verify, verdict, verisimilitude, and veritable and guess that the definition of verdant must have something to do with the concept of truth or reality.

This is clever guesswork, but verdant actually comes from a different family of words. It comes from the same old root as does the French word vert, which means green. If those same clever students had recognized that connection, they might have realized that verdant means green with vegetation, as in a verdant forest.

Similarly, a lot of words that begin with ped- have something to do with foot: pedestrian, pedal, pedestal, pedometer, impede, expedite. A pediatrician, however, is not a foot doctor. A pediatrician is a doctor for children. A podiatrist is a foot doctor. (The word pediatrician is, however, related to the word meaning a strict teacher of children: pedagogue.)

Etymology is a powerful tool to remember words that you already know, but it can’t always be relied upon to determine the meanings of words you don’t know.





Basic Method #4: Writing on Your Brain


Many people find that they can learn new information more readily if they write it down. The physical act of writing seems to plant the information more firmly. Perhaps the explanation is that by writing you are bringing another sense into play (you’ve seen the word, you’ve said and heard the word, and now you’re feeling the word).

You may find it useful to spend some time writing down phrases or sentences incorporating each new word. This is a good way to practice and strengthen your spelling as well.

You’ll probably have more luck if you don’t merely write down the word and its definition over and over again. If you’ve hit upon a good mnemonic or mental image to help you remember it, or you liked the etymology, write it down. You can even draw a picture or a diagram.





Basic Method #5: Putting It All Together with Flashcards and a Notebook


A flashcard, usually made with an index card, contains a word on one side and its definition on the reverse side. You may have used flashcards when you were first learning to read or when you were first tackling a foreign language. Flashcards can turn learning into a game and is an effective way to study and commit words to memory.

Along with the word’s definition, you should also include the pronunciation if you aren’t sure you’ll remember it. Then you can either practice independently or have a friend quiz you.

Here’s a basic flashcard, front and back.

Front



Back



You’ll learn even more if you use your imagination to make the backs of your flashcards a bit more elaborate. For example, you might decorate the back of this card with a diagram of oblique lines—that is, lines that are neither parallel nor perpendicular to each other.

Back



Your diagram now gives you a mental image that can help you remember the word. You’ll probably think of your own mental image, one that means something to you. You could even use the word itself to create a picture that conveys the meaning of the word and that will stick in your mind to help you remember it.

Here’s one possibility. We’ve divided the word into two parts and written them on two different lines that are at an oblique angle to each other.

Back



Practicing with flashcards can be fun. Parents, siblings, and friends sometimes might lend a hand and discover that they learn new words, too. And every time you look at the back of the card, you’ll be reminded of the mnemonic, trick, or mental image you’ve devised to keep the word firmly in your memory.

Tuck a few flashcards in your pocket when you head out the door in the morning, and work on them in spare moments, like when you’re riding on a bus or listening to the radio. The more often you flash through your flashcards, the faster you’ll build your vocabulary.

Reading your flashcards isn’t enough, of course. You also need to make an effort to use the words on them. Using the words, much more than reading the cards, makes the definitions sink in and take hold.

We also encourage you to write down new words you learn in a notebook. If you devote an entire page to each new word, the notebook will give you room to practice “writing on your brain.” It will also give you plenty of space to doodle or jot down images that will help you remember the word.

Even better, you can use your notebook as a place to record actual uses of new words that you discover in your own reading. If, while reading a magazine, you come across one of the words you’re working on, you can copy the sentence into your notebook, giving you a brand-new example of the word in context.

Students who keep notebooks report a sense of accomplishment when they look back through their notebooks at the hundreds of new words they have learned. A notebook gives you tangible (a good word) evidence of the progress you’re making.





A Memorization Game Plan


Here is our step-by-step approach to memorizing new words.

Step 1 Try to deduce the word’s meaning from context.

Step 2 Look it up!

Step 3 Note the spelling.

Step 4 Say the word out loud.

Step 5 Read the main definition. Scan the secondary definitions.

Step 6 Compare the definition with the definitions and usages of the word’s synonyms.

Step 7 Define the word using your own words.

Step 8 Use it in a sentence.

Step 9 Attach the word to a mnemonic, mental image, or other memory aid.

Step 10 Fill out a flashcard and make a new entry in your notebook.

Step 11 Use the new word every chance you get.

Let’s take a look at each of these steps.





Step 1: Try to Deduce the Word’s Meaning From Context


Context will often lead you astray, but doing a bit of detective work is a good way to sharpen your mind and hone your reading comprehension skills. And who knows? You might even guess the right meaning.





Step 2: Look It Up!


Most people try to skip this step. Don’t you dare! You won’t know whether you’re correct about the meaning of a new word until you’ve made sure by looking it up.

No one can learn new words without a dictionary. If you don’t have one, get one now, whether a physical copy from your local bookstore or library or a downloadable app on your smartphone or tablet.





Step 3: Note the Spelling


Look closely at the word’s spelling. Then close your eyes and try to reconstruct the spelling. If you have trouble visualizing, test yourself by writing out the spelling on scrap paper and checking it against the dictionary.

You should also compare the spelling variations with other spelling variations you know. This is a nice trick that helps you recognize words that you think you don’t know.

For example, sober is an adjective; the noun form is sobriety. Okay, with that as a clue, the noun propriety relates to what adjective? Proper. Propriety means what is socially proper or acceptable.

Here’s another example: Do you know what incisive means? Give up? Well, you know what decisive means, don’t you? Decisive relates to what word you know? Decision, of course. Now, what noun do you think incisive relates to? Incision. Incisive means sharp or cutting, as in an incisive remark or an incisive observation.





Step 4: Say the Word Out Loud


Say the word out loud. Hearing the word will bring another sense into play and help you remember the word. And as we noted earlier, you don’t want to make a fool of yourself by mispronouncing words.

Our Pronunciation Key

We’ve never liked the pronunciation keys most dictionaries use. Our key is based on consistent phonetic sounds, so you don’t have to memorize it. Still, it would be a good idea to take a few minutes now and familiarize yourself with the table below. Be sure to note how the e and i are used.

The letter(s) is (are) pronounced like the letter(s) in the word(s)

a

a

bat, can

ah

o

con, bond

aw

paw, straw

ay

a

skate, rake

e

stem, hem

ee

ea

steam, clean

i

rim, chin, hint

ing

ing

sing, ring

oh

o

row, tow

oo

oo

room, boom

ow

ow

cow, brow

oy

oy

boy, toy

u, uh

run, bun

y (ye, eye)

i

climb, time

ch

ch

chair, chin

f

f, ph

film, phony

g

g

go, goon

j

join, jungle

k

c

cool, cat

s

s

solid, wisp

sh

sh

shoe, wish

z

z

zoo, razor

zh

s

measure

uh

a

apologize

All other consonants are pronounced as you would expect. Capitalized letters are accented.





Step 5: Read the Main Definition; Scan the Secondary Definitions


Most dictionaries list the definitions in order of importance. That does not mean, of course, that the first definition is the one you are looking for. Read all the definitions; each will add to your understanding of the word.





Step 6: Compare the Definition with the Definitions and Usages of the Word’s Synonyms


As we showed you with the earlier examples, this step takes a little extra time. Believe us when we say that it is time well spent. Again, seeing how a word is similar to or different from synonyms or related words enhances your understanding of all of them.





Step 7: Define the Word Using Your Own Words


We said it before, and we’ll say it again: you don’t truly know what a word means unless you can define it yourself in your own way.





Step 8: Use It in a Sentence


Now that you know what the word means and what it doesn’t mean, use it. Make up a sentence.

It helps to use the word in a sentence that includes a person or thing or event that you know and that creates a concrete feeling or image. For example, the sentence They are gregarious is not as good as Greg, Gertrude, and Gretchen are gregarious.





Step 9: Attach the Word to a Mnemonic, Mental Image, or Other Memory Aid


With all that you’ve done with the word in the previous steps, you may already have memorized it. The only way to be sure, however, is to fix the word with a mnemonic.





Step 10: Fill Out A Flashcard and Make a New Entry in Your Notebook


The paperwork is very important, particularly if you’re trying to learn a lot of new words in a short period of time.





Step 11: Use the New Word Every Chance You Get


Dare to be repetitious. If you don’t keep new knowledge in shape, you won’t keep it at all.





Two Final Words of Advice: Be Suspicious


You already know some of the words in the book. You may know quite a few of them. Naturally, you don’t need to drill yourself on words you already know and use. But be careful. Before skipping a word, make certain you really do know what it means. Some of the most embarrassing vocabulary mistakes occur when a person confidently uses familiar words incorrectly. Now on to the words. Remember that you’ll retain more (and have more fun) if you tackle this book a little at a time.





CHAPTER 2


The Words

To acquiesce is to do something without objection—to do it quietly. As the similarity of their spellings indicates, the words acquiesce and quiet are closely related. They are both based on Latin words meaning to rest or to be quiet.

Acquiesce is sometimes used sloppily as a simple synonym for agree in situations in which it isn’t really appropriate. For example, it isn’t really possible to acquiesce noisily, enthusiastically, or eagerly. Don’t forget the quiet in the middle.

To acquiesce is to exhibit acquiescence.

ACRID (AK rid) adj harshly pungent; bitter

• The cheese we had at the party had an acrid taste; it was harsh and unpleasant.

Acute means sharp only in a figurative sense. A knife, which is sharp enough to cut, is never said to be acute.

Acute is a word doctors throw around quite a bit. An acute disease is one that reaches its greatest intensity very quickly and then goes away. What could a disease be if it isn’t acute? See chronic.

ADAMANT (AD uh munt) adj stubborn; unyielding; completely inflexible

• Candice was adamant: she would never go out with Paul again.

A very hard substance, like a diamond, is also adamant. Adamantine (ad uh MAN teen) and adamant are synonyms. Adamancy is being adamant.

A religion could be said to have adherents, assuming there are people who believe in it. Governments, causes, ideas, people, philosophies, and many other things can have adherents, too.

Note carefully the pronunciation of this word.

ADMONISH (ad MAHN ish) v to scold gently; to warn

• The boys’ father admonished them not to eat the pie he had just baked. When they did so anyway, he admonished them.

In the first sentence admonish means warn; in the second it means scold gently. Consider yourself admonished not to misuse this word.

ADROIT (uh DROYT) adj skillful; dexterous; clever; shrewd; socially at ease

• Julio was an adroit salesperson: his highly skilled pitch, backed up by extensive product knowledge, nearly always resulted in a sale.

Adroit comes from the French word for right (as in the direction) and refers to an old superstition that right-handedness is superior. It’s a synonym of dexterous (which comes from the Latin for right) and an antonym of gauche and maladroit.

• My brilliant accountant adroitly whipped my taxes into shape, then made a gauche remark about my ignorance of financial matters.

Unadulterated means pure. Unadulterated joy is joy untainted by sadness.

ADVERSE (ad VURS) adj unfavorable; antagonistic

• We had to play our soccer match under adverse conditions: It was snowing, and only three members of our team had bothered to show up.

Airplanes often don’t fly in adverse weather. An airplane that took off in bad weather and reached its destination safely would be said to have overcome adversity. Adversity means misfortune or unfavorable circumstances. To do something “in the face of adversity” is to undertake a task despite obstacles. Some people are at their best in adversity because they rise to the occasion.

A word often confused with adverse is averse (uh VURS). The two are related but they don’t mean quite the same thing. A person who is averse to doing something is a person who doesn’t want to do it. To be averse to something is to be opposed to doing it—to have an aversion to doing it.

AESTHETIC (es THET ik) adj having to do with artistic beauty; artistic

• Our art professor had a highly developed aesthetic sense; he found things to admire in paintings that, to us, looked like garbage.

The noun is agnosticism (ag NAHS tih siz um).

• An atheist himself, Jon concluded from Jorge’s spiritual skepticism that they shared similar beliefs. In fact, Jorge’s reluctance to affirm or discredit a god’s existence reflects his agnosticism.

• If I say, “Cedrick alleges that I stole his hat,” I am saying two things:

1. Cedrick says I stole his hat.

2. I say I didn’t do it.

To allege something is to assert it without proving it. Such an assertion is called an allegation (al uh GAY shun).

The adjective is alleged (uh LEJD). If the police accuse someone of having committed a crime, newspapers will usually refer to that person as an alleged criminal.

ALLUSION (uh LOO zhun) n an indirect reference (often to a literary work); a hint

To allude to something is to refer to it indirectly.

• When Ralph said, “I sometimes wonder whether to be or not to be,” he was alluding to a famous line in Hamlet. If Ralph had said, “As Hamlet said, ‘To be or not to be, that is the question,’” his statement would have been a direct reference, not an allusion.

An allusion is an allusion only if the source isn’t identified directly. Anything else is a reference or a quotation.

• If Andrea says, “I enjoyed your birthday party,” she isn’t alluding to the birthday party; she’s mentioning it. But if she says, “I like your choice of party music,” she is alluding to the party.

ALOOF (uh LOOF) adj uninvolved; standing off; keeping one’s distance

• Al, on the roof, felt very aloof.

To stand aloof from a touch-football game is to stand on the sidelines and not take part.

ALTRUISM (AL troo iz um) n selflessness; generosity; devotion to the interests of others

• The private foundation depended on the altruism of the extremely rich old man. When he decided to start spending his money on yachts and sports cars, the foundation went out of business.

To be altruistic is to help others without expectation of personal gain. Giving money to charity is an act of altruism. The altruist does it just to be nice, although he or she will probably also remember to take a tax deduction.

An altruistic act is also an act of philanthropy, which means almost the same thing.

AMBIENCE (AM bee uns) n atmosphere; mood; feeling

• By decorating their house with plastic beach balls and Popsicle sticks, the Cramers created a playful ambience that delighted young children.

A restaurant’s ambience is the look, mood, and feel of the place. People sometimes say that a restaurant has “an atmosphere of ambience.” To do so is redundant—atmosphere and ambience mean the same thing.

Ambience is a French word that can also be pronounced “ahm BYAHNS.” The adjective ambient (AM bee unt) means surrounding or circulating.

AMBIGUOUS (am BIG yoo us) adj unclear in meaning; confusing; capable of being interpreted in different ways

• We listened to the weather report, but the forecast was ambiguous; we couldn’t tell whether the day was going to be rainy or sunny.

• The amenities at the local club include a swimming pool, a golf course, and a tennis court.

If an older guest at your house asks you where the amenities are, he or she is probably asking for directions to the bathroom.

Those little bars of soap and bottles of shampoo found in hotel rooms are known in the hotel business as amenities. They are meant to increase your comfort. People like them because people like almost anything that is free (although, of course, the cost of providing such amenities is simply added to the price of hotel rooms).

AMIABLE (AY mee uh bul) adj friendly; agreeable

• Our amiable guide made us feel right at home in what would otherwise have been a cold and forbidding museum.

• The drama critic was so amiable in person that even the subjects of negative reviews found it impossible not to like her.

Amicable is a similar and related word. Two not very amiable people might nonetheless make an amicable agreement. Amicable means politely friendly or not hostile. Two countries might trade amicably with each other even while technically remaining enemies.

• Julio and Clarissa had a surprisingly amicable divorce and remained good friends even after paying their lawyers’ fees.

AMNESTY (AM nuh stee) n an official pardon for a group of people who have violated a law or policy

Amnesty comes from the same root as amnesia, the condition that causes characters in movies to forget everything except how to speak English and drive their cars.

An amnesty is an official forgetting. When a state government declares a tax amnesty, it is saying that if people pay the taxes they owe, the government will officially “forget” that they broke the law by not paying them in the first place.

The word amnesty always refers to a pardon given to a group or class of people. A pardon granted to a single person is simply a pardon.

AMORAL (ay MOR ul) adj lacking a sense of right and wrong; neither good nor bad, neither moral nor immoral; without moral feelings

• Very young children are amoral; when they cry, they aren’t being bad or good—they’re merely doing what they have to do.

A moral person does right; an immoral person does wrong; an amoral person simply does.

AMOROUS (AM ur us) adj feeling loving, especially in a sexual sense; in love; relating to love

• The amorous couple made quite a scene at the movie. The movie they were watching, Love Story, was pretty amorous itself. It was about an amorous couple, one of whom died.

• Ed’s teacher said that his term paper was amorphous; it was as shapeless and disorganized as a cloud.

• The sleepy little town was engulfed by an amorphous blob of glowing protoplasm—a higher intelligence from outer space.

To say that something has an “amorphous shape” is a contradiction. How can a shape be shapeless?

ANACHRONISM (uh NAK ruh niz um) n something out of place in time or history; an incongruity

• In this day of impersonal hospitals, a doctor who remembers your name seems like an anachronism.

ANALOGY (uh NAL uh jee) n a comparison of one thing to another; similarity

• To say having an allergy feels like being bitten by an alligator would be to make or draw an analogy between an allergy and an alligator bite.

Analogy usually refers to similarities between things that are not otherwise very similar. If you don’t think an allergy is at all like an alligator bite, you might say, “That analogy doesn’t hold up.” To say that there is no analogy between an allergy and an alligator bite is to say that they are not analogous (uh NAL uh gus).

Something similar in a particular respect to something else is its analog (AN uh lawg), sometimes spelled analogue.

ANARCHY (AN ur kee) n absence of government or control; lawlessness; disorder

• The country fell into a state of anarchy after the rebels kidnapped the president and locked the legislature inside the Capitol.

The word doesn’t have to be used in its strict political meaning. You could say that there was anarchy in the kindergarten when the teacher stepped out of the door for a moment. You could say it, and you would probably be right.

The words anarchy and monarchy are closely related. Anarchy means no leader; monarchy, a government headed by a king or queen, means one leader.

ANECDOTE (AN ik doht) n a short account of a humorous or revealing incident

• The old lady kept the motorcycle gang thoroughly amused with anecdote after anecdote about her cute little dog.

• Alvare told an anecdote about the time Jessica got her big toe stuck in a bowling ball.

• The vice president set the crowd at ease with an anecdote about his childhood desire to become a vice president.

• A snowy winter day is not an anomaly, but a snowy July day is.

• A house without a roof is an anomaly—a cold, wet anomaly.

A roofless house could be said to be anomalous. Something that is anomalous is something that is not normal or regular.

ANTECEDENT (an tuh SEED unt) n someone or something that went before; something that provides a model for something that came after it

• Your parents and grandparents could be said to be your antecedents; they came before you.

• The horse-drawn wagon is an antecedent of the modern automobile.

Antecedent can also be used as an adjective. The oil lamp was antecedent to the light bulb.

In grammar, the antecedent of a pronoun is the person, place, or thing to which it refers. In the previous sentence, the antecedent of it is antecedent. In the sentence “Bill and Harry were walking together, and then he hit him,” it is impossible to determine what the antecedents of the pronouns (he and him) are.

Antecedent is related to a word that is similar in meaning: precedent.

ANTIPATHY (an TIP uh thee) n firm dislike

• I feel antipathy toward bananas wrapped in ham. I do not want them for dinner. I also feel a certain amount of antipathy toward the cook who keeps trying to force me to eat them. My feelings on these matters are quite antipathetic (an tip uh THET ik).

I could also say that ham-wrapped bananas and the cooks who serve them are among my antipathies. My antipathies are the things I don’t like.

Note carefully the pronunciation of this word.

ANTITHESIS (an TITH uh sis) n the direct opposite

• Erin is the antithesis of Aaron: Erin is bright and beautiful; Aaron is dull and plain.

Note carefully the pronunciation of this word.

APARTHEID (uh PAHRT hyte) n the former policy of racial segregation and oppression in the Republic of South Africa

The word apartheid is sometimes applied to less radical forms of racial injustice and to other kinds of separation. Critics have sometimes accused American public schools of practicing educational apartheid by providing substandard schooling for nonwhites.

APOCALYPSE (uh PAHK uh lips) n a prophetic revelation, especially one concerning the end of the world

In strict usage, apocalypse refers to specific Christian writings, but most people use it more generally in connection with predictions of things like nuclear war, the destruction of the ozone layer, and the spread of fast-food restaurants to every corner of the universe. To make such predictions, or to be deeply pessimistic, is to be apocalyptic (uh pahk uh LIP tik).

APOCRYPHAL (uh POK ruh ful) n of dubious authenticity; fictitious; spurious

• Brandi’s blog discredited the apocryphal report of Martians in Congress.

An apocryphal story is one whose truth is not proven or whose falsehood is strongly suspected. Like apocalypse, this word has a religious origin. The Apocrypha are a number of “extra” books of the Old Testament that Protestants and Jews don’t include in their Bibles because they don’t think they’re authentic.

APOTHEOSIS (uh pahth ee OH sis) n elevation to divine status; the perfect example of something

• Some people think that the Corvette is the apotheosis of American car making. They think it’s the ideal.

• Geoffrey is unbearable to be with. He thinks he’s the apotheosis of masculinity.

APPROBATION (ap ruh BAY shun) n approval; praise

• The crowd expressed its approbation of the team’s performance by gleefully covering the field with toilet paper.

• Nick appropriated my lunch; he grabbed it out of my hands and ate it. So I appropriated Ed’s.

• The deer and raccoons appropriated the vegetables in our garden last summer. This year we’ll build a better fence.

Don’t confuse the pronunciation of the verb to appropriate with the pronunciation of the adjective appropriate (uh PROH pree it). When Congress decides to buy some new submarines, it appropriates money for them. That is, it sets some money aside. The money thus set aside is called an appropriation.

When an elected official takes money that was supposed to be spent on submarines and spends it on a Rolls-Royce and a few mink coats, he or she is said to have misappropriated the money.

When the government decides to build a highway through your backyard, it expropriates your property for this purpose. That is, it uses its official authority to take possession of your property.

People who act as though they think they are better than everyone else are often said to be aristocratic. A person with an “aristocratic bearing” is a person who keeps his or her nose in the air and looks down on everyone else.

ARTFUL (AHRT ful) adj crafty; wily; sly

• After dinner, the artful counselor told the campers that there was a madman loose in the woods, thus causing them to lie quietly in the tent.

ARTIFICE (AHRT uh fus) n a clever trick; cunning

• The Trojan Horse was an artifice designed to get the soldiers inside the walls.

BENEFACTOR (BEN uh fak tur) n one who provides help, especially in the form of a gift or donation

To give benefits is to be a benefactor. To receive benefits is to be a beneficiary. People very, very often confuse these two words. It would be to their benefit to keep them straight.

If your next-door neighbor rewrites his life insurance policy so that you will receive all his millions when he dies, then you become the beneficiary of the policy. If your neighbor dies, he is your benefactor.

A malefactor (MAL uh fak tur) is a person who does bad things.

• Batman and Robin made life hell for malefactors in Gotham City.

Remember Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty’s evil nemesis? Her name is a variation of this idea.

BENEVOLENT (beh NEV uh lunt) adj generous; kind; doing good deeds

The opposite of a benign tumor is a malignant one. This is a tumor that can kill you. A malignant personality is one you wish a surgeon would remove. Malignant means nasty, evil, or full of ill will. The word malignant also conveys a sense that evil is spreading, as with a cancer. An adjective that means the same thing is malign.

As a verb, malign has a different meaning. To malign someone is to say unfairly bad things about that person, to injure that person by telling evil lies about him or her. Slander and malign are synonyms.

To blaspheme (blas FEEM) is to use swear words or say deeply irreverent things. A person who says such things is blasphemous.

BLATANT (BLAYT unt) adj unpleasantly or offensively noisy; glaring

• David was blatantly critical of our efforts; that is, he was noisy and obnoxious in making his criticisms.

Blatant is often confused with flagrant, because both words mean glaring. Blatant indicates that something was not concealed very well, whereas flagrant indicates that something was intentional.

BOURGEOIS (boor ZHWAH) adj middle class, usually in a pejorative sense; boringly conventional

The original bourgeoisie (boor zhwaw ZEE) were simply people who lived in cities, an innovation at the time. They weren’t farmers and they weren’t nobles. They were members of a new class—the middle class. Now the word is used mostly in making fun of or sneering at people who think about nothing but their possessions and conforming with other people like them.

A hip, young city dweller might reject life in the suburbs as being too bourgeois. A person whose dream is to have a swimming pool in his or her backyard might be called bourgeois by someone who thinks there are more important things in life. Golf is often referred to as a bourgeois sport.

CACOPHONY (kuh KAHF uh nee) n harsh-sounding mixture of words, voices, or sounds

• The parade’s two marching bands played simultaneously; the resulting cacophony drove many spectators to tears.

A cacophony isn’t just a lot of noise—it’s a lot of noise that doesn’t sound good together. A steam whistle blowing isn’t a cacophony. But a high school orchestra that had never rehearsed together might very well produce a cacophony. The roar of engines, horns, and sirens arising from a busy city street would be a cacophony. A lot of people all shouting at once would produce a cacophony.

Euphony is the opposite of cacophony. Euphony is pleasing sound.

CADENCE (KAYD uns) n rhythm; the rise and fall of sounds

CAPITALISM (KAP uh tuh liz um) n an economic system in which businesses are owned by private citizens (not by the government) and in which the resulting products and services are sold with relatively little government control

CARICATURE (KAR uh kuh chur) n a portrait or description that is purposely distorted or exaggerated, often to prove some point about its subject

• Khoa sat for a caricature at the end of the marathon, but wasn’t pleased with the result: the portrait exaggerated his already dominant acne.

Editorial cartoonists often draw caricatures. Big noses, enormous glasses, floppy ears, and other distortions are common in such drawings. A politician who has been convicted of bribery might be depicted in a prison uniform or with a ball and chain around his or her ankle. If the politician has big ears to begin with, the ears might be drawn vastly bigger.

A caricature uses exaggeration to bring out the hidden character of its subject.

The word can also be used as a verb. To caricature someone is to create such a distorted portrait.

CASTIGATE (KAS tuh gayt) v to criticize severely; to chastise

• Jose’s mother-in-law castigated him for forgetting to pick her up at the airport.

CATALYST (KAT uh list) n in chemistry, something that changes the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being changed; anyone or anything that makes something happen without being directly involved in it

CATHOLIC (KATH lik) adj universal; embracing everything

• Da Vinci was a catholic genius who excelled at everything he did.

• The expression “you can’t judge a book by its cover” is a cliché; it’s been used so many times that it’s become stale.

Clichés are usually true. That’s why they’ve been repeated often enough to become overused. But they are boring. A writer who uses a lot of clichés—referring to a foreign country as “a land of contrasts,” describing spring as “a time of renewal,” saying that a snowfall is “a blanket of white”—is not interesting to read because there is nothing new about these observations.

Note carefully the pronunciation of this French word.

CLIQUE (kleek; klik) n an exclusive group bound together by some shared quality or interest

EPIGRAM (EP uh gram) n a brief and usually witty or satirical saying

People often find it difficult to remember the difference between an epigram and these similar-looking words:

epigraph: an apt quotation placed at the beginning of a book or essay

To say that the autumn hillside was a blaze of color is to use the word blaze in a figurative sense. The hillside wasn’t really on fire, but the colors of the leaves made it appear (somewhat) as though it were.

A figurative meaning of a word is one that is not literal. A literal statement is one in which every word means exactly what it says. If the housing market had literally sprouted wings, genuine wings would somehow have popped out of it.

People very, very often confuse these words, using one when they really mean the other.

FORTUITOUS (for TOO uh tus) adj accidental; occurring by chance

• The program’s outcome was not the result of any plan but was entirely fortuitous.

• Gabriella is gregarious and garrulous; she loves to hang out with the gang and gab.

GAUCHE (gohsh) adj unskillful; awkward; maladroit

Remember dextrous? Well, gauche is pretty much the exact opposite.

These days, gauche tends to describe social, rather than physical, ineptness.

• Smadar had a poor sense of comic timing, and her gauche attempts to mock her left-handed friends soon left her with none.

• The scathing review of the movie contained several gratuitous remarks about the love life of the director.

GRAVITY (GRAV uh tee) n seriousness

• The newsanchor’s nervous giggling was entirely inappropriate, given the gravity of the situation.

• No one realized the gravity of Myron’s drug addiction until it was much too late to help him.

CHAPTER 4


SAT Key Terms





Need-to-Know Words for the SAT


Although the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT emphasizes critical reading and writing skills, many questions nevertheless test your vocabulary knowledge, such as vocabulary-in-context questions. Other questions are related to vocabulary in a more peripheral way; the reading passages, grammar sections (especially those involving diction), and even the essay will be more easily dealt with if you have an erudite vocabulary. If you learn every word on the main word list in this book, you’ll have a big advantage on the SAT. The bigger your vocabulary, the better you’ll do. But not every word on the main list is the sort of word that is tested on the SAT. If you’re getting ready to take the SAT or a similar standardized test, you should focus your attention on the words in the following list.

We’ve included short definitions to make it easier for you to learn the words. These definitions aren’t always exactly like the ones you’ll find in the dictionary or the main word list of this book; the y’re the definitions of the words as they are tested on the SAT.

Keep in mind that these are not the only words you need to know for the SAT. They’re just the words that have been tested most frequently in the past—the words that the test writers tend to come back to over and over again

Some SATs are absolutely loaded words on this list; others don’t contain as many. One of the most important things these key terms will teach you is the level of the vocabulary on the test. Once you get a feel for this level, you’ll be able to spot other possible so-called SAT words in your reading.

After you review these key terms, you should also turn to the GRE list starting on this page. Of course, all of the words in this book are ones that will help you on standardized tests.

CHAPTER 6


Word Roots You Should Know





You Don’t Have to Memorize These Roots—You Already Know Them!


Here is a list of the most helpful roots to know. As mentioned earlier, learning roots helps you memorize words. We’ve focused on roots that will help you learn the Word Smart words, but this list will help you memorize hundreds of other words, too.

When you look up the definition of a word on this list, try to relate that definition to the root. Some students go through this list one root at a time. They look up all the words under one root and learn the definitions together. As always, whatever works for you is best.

To show you how each root relates to words you already know, each list includes an easy word or two. For example, the root spec- comes from a Latin word meaning to look or see, as in the easy words spectator and spectacles. Recognizing that will help you memorize the definition of the less common words specter and circumspect, which are on the same list. And you thought you didn’t know Latin!

You will notice that the same root can be spelled in different ways. We have included the most common spelling variations in the heading. Remember that roots tell us the common heritage of words thousands of years old. Over the centuries spelling variations are bound to occur.

A note to philologists (etymologically, “word lovers”): In keeping with our pragmatic philosophy, we have sometimes taken liberties in compiling this list.

CHAPTER 7


Common Usage Errors




Some of the most embarrassing language errors involve words so common and so apparently simple that almost no one would think of looking them up. The following list contains a number of the most frequently misused words and expressions in the language.

ALL RIGHT Not “alright.”

AMONG/BETWEEN Among is used with three or more people or things; between is used with two.

• The tin-can telephone line ran between the two houses.

• Among the twelve members of the committee were only three women.

• Mr. Nuñez distributed the candy among the four of us.

Between you and I is incorrect; between you and me is correct.

ANXIOUS This word properly means “filled with anxiety,” not “eager.” Don’t say you’re anxious for school to end unless the ending of school makes you feel fearful.

AS FAR AS…IS CONCERNED Not a stylish expression, but if you use it, don’t leave out the is concerned. It is not correct to say, “As far as money, I’d like to be rich.” Instead, you should say, “As far as money is concerned, I’d like to be rich.”

AS/LIKE You can run like a fox, but you can’t run like a fox runs.

Like is used only with nouns, pronouns, and grammatical constructions that act like nouns.

• Joe runs like a fox.

• Joe runs as a fox runs.

• Joe runs the way a fox runs.

BIWEEKLY, BIMONTHLY. Biweekly means either twice a week or once every two weeks, depending on who is using it. Likewise with bimonthly. If you need to be precise, avoid these words by saying “twice a week” or “every other week” instead. Fortnightly means once every two weeks.

CAN/MAY Can denotes ability; may denotes permission. If you can do something, you are able to do it. If you may do something, you are permitted to do it.

CAPITAL/CAPITOL Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States. The building where Congress meets is the Capitol.

COMMON/MUTUAL Common means “shared”; mutual means “reciprocal.” If Tim and Tom have a common dislike, they both dislike the same thing (anchovies). If Tim and Tom have a mutual dislike, they dislike each other.

COMMONPLACE In careful usage, this word is an adjective meaning “ordinary” or “uninteresting.” It can also be used as a noun meaning a “trite or obvious observation” or a “cliché.” It should not be used sloppily as a substitute for the word “common.”

• To say that French food is the best in the world is a commonplace.

• It is commonplace but neither interesting nor perceptive to say that French food is the best in the world.

COMPARE TO/COMPARE WITH To compare an apple to an orange is to say that an apple is like an orange. To compare an apple with an orange is to discuss the similarities and differences between the two fruits.

• Daisuke compared his girlfriend’s voice to the sound of a cat howling in the night; that is, he said his girlfriend sounded like a cat howling in the night.

• I compared my grades with Beth’s and discovered that she had done better in every subject except math.

DIFFERENT FROM Different from is correct; “different than” is not.

• My dog is different from your dog.

EACH OTHER/ONE ANOTHER Each other is used with two; one another is used with three or more.

• A husband and wife should love each other.

• The fifteen members of the group had to learn to get along with one another.

EQUALLY AS Nothing is ever “equally as” anything as anything else.

• Your car and Dave’s car might be equally fast.

You should never say that the two cars are equally as fast. Nor should you say that your car is equally as fast as Dave’s. You should simply say that it is as fast.

(THE) FACT THAT/THAT You almost never need to use “the fact that”; that alone will suffice.

Instead of saying, “I was appalled by the fact that he was going to the movies,” say, “I was appalled that he was going to the movies.”

FARTHER/FURTHER Farther refers to actual, literal distance—the kind measured in inches and miles. Further refers to figurative distance. Use farther if the distance can be measured; use further if it cannot.

• Paris is farther from New York than London is.

• Paris is further from my thoughts than London is.

• We hiked seven miles but then were incapable of hiking farther.

• I made a nice outline for my thesis but never went any further.

FEWER, LESS Fewer is used with things that can be counted, less with things that cannot. That is, fewer refers to number; less refers to quantity.

• I have fewer sugar lumps than Henry does.

• I have less sugar.

Despite what you hear on television, it is not correct to say that one soft drink contains “less calories” than another. It contains fewer calories (calories can be counted); it is less fattening.

FORMER, LATTER Former means the first of two people or things; latter means the second of two. If you are referring to three or more things, you shouldn’t use former and latter.

It is incorrect to say, “The restaurant had hamburgers, hot dogs, and pizzas; we ordered the former.” Instead, say, “We ordered the first,” or, “We ordered hamburgers.”

IF/WHETHER Almost everyone uses if in situations that call for whether. If should be used when something may or may not happen and is usually followed by then. Whether should be used when more than one alternative is being discussed. For example: “We need to decide whether we should go to the show or stay home.” The use of if in this situation is widely accepted, but the use of if in some situations might cause confusion. Consider this sentence: “Let me know if you’re coming tonight.” Someone might interpret this to mean “If you’re coming tonight, then let me know. If you’re not coming tonight, then you don’t have to reply.” To make it clear that you expect a response, use whether: “Let me know whether you’re coming tonight.” This should be interpreted as “No matter what you decide, please let me know your plans.”

IRREGARDLESS This is not a word. Say regardless or irrespective.

LAY/LIE The only way to “lay down on the beach” is to take small feathers and place them in the sand.

To lay is to place or set.

• Will the widow lay flowers by the grave? She already laid them, or she has already laid them. Who lies in the grave? Her former husband lies there. He lay there yesterday, too. In fact, he has lain there for several days.

PLURALS AND SINGULARS

The following words take plural verbs:

both

criteria

media

phenomena



The following words take singular verbs:

criterion

each

either

every, everybody, everyone, everything

medium

neither

none, no one, nobody, nothing

phenomenon



PRESENTLY Presently means “soon,” not “now” or “currently.”

• The mailman should be here presently; in fact, he should be here in about five minutes.

• The mailman is here now.

STATIONARY/STATIONERY Stationary means not moving; stationery is notepaper.

THAT/WHICH Most people confuse these two words. Many people who know the difference have trouble remembering it. Here’s a simple rule that will almost always work: that can never have a comma in front of it; which always will.

• There is the car that ran over my foot.

• Ed’s car, which ran over my foot, is over there.

• I like sandwiches that are dripping with mustard.

• My sandwich, which was dripping with mustard, was the kind I like.

Which is used in place of that if it follows another that: “We were fond of that feeling of contentment which follows victory.”

CHAPTER 9


The Arts




You don’t need to be a master of music, literature, film, or another artistic discipline to keep up in a conversation or course about the arts. Here are some major key art terms to keep in your back pocket.

ALLITERATION A poetic device involving the use of two or more words with the same initial consonant sounds. Big Bird is an alliterative name.

BAUHAUS A German school of art and architecture founded in 1919. Bauhaus style is characterized by harsh geometric form and great austerity of detail.

BIOPIC A biographical film. Gandhi and Malcolm X are well-known biopics. Some, such as The Hours (about Virginia Woolf) and Capote (about Truman Capote and Harper Lee), interweave real and fictitious plots or use a single incident to shed light on a person’s entire life.

BLANK VERSE Unrhymed verse, especially in iambic pentameter.

CHAMBER MUSIC Music written for and performed by small ensembles of players. The string quartet (two violins, viola, and cello) is the most influential form of chamber music ensemble.

CHIAROSCURO An artistic technique in which form is conveyed by light and dark only, not by color.

CONCERTO A musical composition for an orchestra and one or more soloists.

CUBISM An early 20th century artistic movement involving, among other things, the fragmented portrayal of three-dimensional objects. Cubism was given its highest expression by Pablo Picasso.

DOCUMENTARY A nonfiction film intended to record or capture (and often comment on) some part of reality. Hoop Dreams, March of the Penguins, and Fahrenheit 9/11 are examples of well-known documentaries.

FREE VERSE Unrhymed and unmetered (or irregularly rhymed and metered) verse.

FRESCO An artistic technique in which paint is applied to wet plaster, causing the painted image to become bound into the decorated surface.

HAIKU A three-line, non-rhyming poem in which the first and third lines contain five syllables, and the second contains seven. Traditional Japanese haiku (plural and singular forms are identical) often evoke the seasons.

IAMBIC PENTAMETER A poetic metrical form in which each line of verse consists of ten syllables, of which only the even-numbered syllables are stressed.

IMPRESSIONISM A late 19th century French movement in painting that attempted, among other things, to convey the effect of light more vividly than had previously been done. Claude Monet was among the most influential of the Impressionists.

JAZZ An influential American music style rooted in African and African-American traditions with input from diverse sources. Jazz has many spin-offs and subgenres. Famous jazz musicians have included Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker.

LIBERAL ARTS A general course of study focusing on literature, art, history, philosophy, and related subjects rather than on specifically vocational instruction.

METAPHOR A figure of speech involving the use of words associated with one thing in connection with another in order to point up some revealing similarity between the two. To refer to someone’s nose as his or her beak is to use metaphor to say something unflattering about the person’s nose.

MOSAIC An art form in which designs are produced by inlaying small tiles or pieces of stone, glass, or other materials.

NARRATIVE FILM A fiction film told primarily in chronological order. Most popular films fall into this category.

NOIR A film and literature style portraying crime and sleaze in an atmosphere of mystery, bleakness, cynicism, and/or glamour. Noir (pronounced “nwar”) often contains a political subtext of corruption or paranoia. Well-known examples include The Big Sleep and Chinatown.

OPERA A drama set to music, in which the dialogue is sung rather than spoken.

OVERTURE An introductory musical piece for an opera or other work of musical drama.

POSTCOLONIALISM A literary and philosophical movement concerned with life and identity in formerly colonized cultures. Well-known postcolonial writers include Franz Fanon, Jamaica Kincaid, and Salman Rushdie.

RENAISSANCE The blossoming of art, literature, science, and culture in general that transformed Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries.

ROMAN À CLEF A novel in which the characters and events are disguised versions of real people and events.

ROMANTICISM An anticlassical literary and artistic movement that began in Europe in the late 18th century. William Wordsworth and John Keats were perhaps the preeminent Romantic poets.

SIMILE A figure of speech in which one thing is likened to something else. A simile will always contain the word like or as. To call someone’s nose a beak is to use a metaphor; to say that someone’s nose is like a beak is to use a simile.

SONATA An instrumental musical composition consisting of several movements.

SONNET A verse form consisting of fourteen lines of iambic pentameter rhymed in a strict scheme.

STILL LIFE An artistic depiction of arranged objects.

STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS A literary technique in which an author attempts to reproduce in prose the unstructured rush of real human thought.

SURREALISM A primarily French artistic and literary movement of the early 20th century that attempted to incorporate imagery from dreams and the unconscious into works of art.

SYMPHONY A major work for orchestra, usually consisting of several movements.





CHAPTER 10


Finance




Reading the financial pages of the newspaper can be confusing if you don’t know the lingo. Here are some of the terms that crop up most often.

ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) A loan’s annual percentage rate is the loan’s true interest rate when all the costs of borrowing are taken into account. Before lending you $10,000 at a nominal interest rate of 12 percent, a bank may charge you a fee of several hundred dollars. The effective interest rate on the loan—its APR—would include the cost of paying this fee and would thus be somewhat higher than 12 percent.

ASSET An asset is something you own. A liability is something you owe.

BANKRUPTCY A procedure by which a deeply indebted person or company sacrifices most or all remaining assets in exchange for being relieved of the obligation to repay any remaining debts.

BEAR MARKET A falling stock market.

BONDS When you buy a bond you are, in effect, lending money to the city, company, or other entity that issued it. In return, the issuer pays you interest.

There are many different kinds of bonds. U.S. government bonds are bonds issued by the federal government. When you buy a government bond, you’re helping to finance the federal deficit. Municipal bonds are bonds issued by cities, counties, and states. They are often issued to finance specific projects, such as the construction of a highway or an athletic stadium. Corporate bonds are bonds issued by companies. Junk bonds are high-interest, high-risk bonds issued by relatively uncredit-worthy borrowers.

BOOK VALUE A company’s book value is what the company would be worth if its assets (including office buildings and furniture) were all sold and its liabilities were all paid off.

BULL MARKET A rising stock market.

CALL An option to buy stock at a certain price within a certain period of time. A put is an option to sell stock at a certain price within a certain period of time. Puts and calls are not for amateurs.

CAPITAL GAIN The profit on the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other so-called capital assets. If you buy a stock for $5 a share and sell it a few weeks later for $1,000 a share, you have a capital gain of $995 a share. A capital loss is the same thing in reverse.

COMMODITIES Pork bellies, beef fat, wheat, corn, gold, silver, and other animal, vegetable, and mineral products are a few examples of commodities. Contracts for these items are traded in highly risky markets that are no place for someone who can’t afford to lose a lot of money.

COMMON STOCKS A share of common stock represents a (usually tiny) piece of the company that issues it. If you own a share of stock in a company, you own a fraction of the company itself and are entitled to a corresponding fraction of the company’s profits, usually paid in the form of quarterly dividends.

COMPOUND INTEREST Compound interest is interest paid on interest that’s already been paid. If you put $100 in a savings account and don’t withdraw the interest payments, the effective interest rate on your initial investment rises as each new interest payment increases the value of your account. The compounding of interest causes an account earning 10 percent interest to double in value in about seven years instead of the ten you might expect.

CORPORATE BONDS See bonds.

DISCOUNT BROKERAGE A stockbrokerage that charges lower commissions than traditional stockbrokerages but provides fewer services.

DIVIDEND When a company earns profits, it typically reinvests some in itself and distributes the rest to its shareholders, who are the company’s owners. These profit distributions are typically paid quarterly and are called dividends.

DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE An index based on the stock prices of thirty big industrial companies. The Dow Jones isn’t a representative sample of either the stock market or the economy in general, but it has traditionally been used as a barometer of both.

EQUITY Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities. If your house (an asset) is worth $100,000 and you owe $45,000 on it (a liability), your equity in your house is $55,000.

A home equity loan is a loan backed by your equity in your home. Home equity loans used to be called second mortgages. If you stop paying off your home equity loan, you risk losing your house.

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION The FDIC is the government agency that insures bank deposits.

HOME EQUITY LOAN See equity.

MARGIN Buying stock on margin is buying stock in part with money borrowed from the stockbroker. Buying on margin is risky. If the price of a stock you bought on margin falls below a certain point, the broker will require you to put up more money. If you don’t have the money, you may be forced to sell the stock immediately at a loss in order to cover your position.

MORTGAGE When you obtain a mortgage to buy a house, what you are really doing is persuading a bank to buy a house for you and let you live in it in exchange for your promise to pay back the bank, with interest, over a period of years. If you stop paying back the bank, the bank may take back the house. In other words, the bank lends you enough money to buy the house with the understanding that the bank gets the house if you don’t pay back the loan. A traditional mortgage runs for thirty years at a fixed interest rate with fixed monthly payments, but there are many variations.

MUTUAL FUND A mutual fund is an investment pool in which a large number of investors put their money together in the hope of making more money than they would have if they had invested on their own. Mutual funds are run by professional managers who may or may not be better than the average person at picking good investments. Some mutual funds invest only in stocks; some invest only in bonds; some invest only in metals; some invest only in Japanese stocks; some invest in a little of everything; some invest in whatever looks good at the moment.

ODD LOT Less than 100 shares of a company’s stock. Groups of shares in multiples of 100 are known as round lots. Brokerages typically charge slightly higher commissions on transactions involving odd lots.

OPTION The opportunity to do something else (such as buy a certain number of shares at a certain price) at some time in the future.

OVER-THE-COUNTER STOCK An OTC stock is one that isn’t traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ; one of several smaller stock exchanges. A stock exchange is a big marketplace where buyers and sellers (or, usually, their representatives) gather to do business within a framework of mutually agreed-upon rules and limitations. But not all stocks are bought and sold through stock exchanges. These stocks (typically those of smaller, less-established companies) are said to be bought and sold “over the counter.” To buy or sell such a stock, you have to do business directly with someone who deals in it, or “makes a market” in it. Most stockbrokers of any size have over-the-counter departments that handle such transactions.

PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO A stock’s P/E is the ratio of its price and the value of the company’s earnings in the past year divided by the number of shares outstanding. If a stock sells for $20 a share and had earnings of $2 a share, its P/E is 10, and its share price is said to be “ten times earnings.” In theory, if everything else is equal, a stock with a high P/E is a worse buy than a stock with a low P/E, but there are many exceptions.

PRIME RATE The interest rate that banks charge their biggest and best loan customers. Everybody else pays more. Many loan rates are keyed to the prime, which is why a change in the prime rate affects more than just the biggest and best loan customers.

PROXY Ownership of a share of stock entitles the shareholder to vote at the company’s annual meeting. Shareholders who can’t attend the meeting can still vote by sending in a proxy—essentially, an absentee ballot.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION The SEC is the government agency that oversees the trading of stocks, bonds, and other securities.

SELLING SHORT To sell a stock short is to sell it before you own it. Sounds impossible? It’s not. Selling short is a way to make money on a stock when its price is going down. What you do, technically, is sell stock borrowed from your broker, then buy the same number of shares later, when the price has fallen. What happens if the price doesn’t fall? You lose money.

STOCK SPLIT When a stock “splits two for one,” shareholders are issued an additional share for every share they own at the time of the split. The effect is to halve the price per share, because each share is now worth half of what it was worth when there were only half as many. Companies generally split their stocks in order to knock the share price down to a level at which, the company hopes, it will be more attractive to investors.

Stock splits are sometimes referred to as stock dividends. But a stock dividend isn’t really a dividend at all, because it doesn’t have any value.

TAX SHELTER Any investment that permits the investor to protect income from taxation. Tax reform has eliminated most of these. Tax shelters that sound too good to be true tend to be not only too good to be true but also illegal. There are still a lot of humbler tax shelters, though. Buying a house is one: interest on mortgage payments is deductible, and the resulting tax savings amounts to a federal housing subsidy for people wealthy enough to buy their own homes.

WARRANT An option to buy a certain amount of stock at a certain price within a certain period of time.

YIELD The annual income generated by an investment expressed as a percentage of its cost. If a stock has a yield of 4 percent, it pays dividends equal to 4 percent of purchase price of a share of its stock.

CHAPTER 12


Science




Here’s a list of scientific terms that turn up in newspapers and magazines with great frequency. You won’t learn much science by learning this list, but you’ll learn some words that may help you keep your bearings.

ABSOLUTE ZERO The temperature at which atoms become so cold they stop moving: –459.67˚F or –273.15˚C. This is theoretically the lowest possible temperature.

ANTIBODY The key part of the immune system. An antibody is a protein produced by the body in response to invasion of the body by a virus, bacterium, or other threatening substance. The antibody attacks the invader and then remains in the bloodstream, providing continuing immunity.

ANTIMATTER In effect, the mirror image of ordinary matter. Each of the elementary particles has a corresponding anti-particle, with an opposite electrical charge. When matter and antimatter collide, both are annihilated, and energy is released.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE The general name for attempts to reproduce human mental processes with computers.

BEHAVIORISM A branch of psychology whose principal tenet is that all behavior consists of reflexive responses to external stimuli.

BIG BANG A massive explosion that theoretically began the universe between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago.

CHROMOSOME A structure in the nucleus of a cell that contains DNA and carries genetic information.

CLONING A technology used to produce an organism that is genetically identical to another organism.

COSMOLOGY The study of the origins, structure, and future of the universe.

DARK ENERGY A hypothetical force that some cosmologists believe counteracts gravity and accounts for the accelerating expansion of the universe; Einstein was first to posit the existence of dark energy, though he later referred to the idea as his “biggest blunder.”

DARK MATTER Invisible hypothetical matter thought by some scientists to constitute as much as 90 percent of the mass in the universe.

DNA An abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid, the substance that is the principal component of genes; hence, DNA is the primary carrier of genetic information.

ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION Visible light, radio signals, microwaves, ultraviolet light, and X rays are all examples of electromagnetic radiation, which is energy radiated in waves from certain electrically charged elementary particles.

ELECTRON MICROSCOPE A device that uses streams of electrons to provide greatly magnified images of objects far too small to be seen by the human eye or even by ordinary optical microscopes.

ELEMENTARY PARTICLES The tiny particles that make up atoms and are thus the building blocks of all matter. Protons, neutrons, and electrons were once believed to be the only elementary particles, but it is now known that these particles are themselves made up of smaller particles and that the list of elementary particles is quite long. Among the newer additions to the list are quarks, muons, pions, gluons, positrons, and neutrinos.

ENDORPHINS Sometimes referred to as the body’s own narcotics, endorphins are substances produced by the pituitary gland that can reduce pain, alter moods, and have other effects.

ENZYME Any of a large number of substances in organisms that speed up or make possible various biological processes.

GENE A chemical pattern on a chromosome. Genes make up units of information that govern the inheritance of all biological structures and functions.

GENETIC ENGINEERING A science devoted to altering genes in order to produce organisms with more desirable characteristics, such as resistance to disease.

GENOME The complete set of a creature’s genes.

GREENHOUSE EFFECT The phenomenon whereby the earth’s atmosphere (especially when altered by the addition of various pollutants) traps some of the heat of the sun and warms the surface of the earth.

HOLOGRAM A three-dimensional image produced by a photographic process called holography, which involves lasers.

HYDROCARBON Any of a large number of organic compounds composed of hydrogen and carbon. Butane, methane, and propane are three of the lighter hydrocarbons. Gasoline, kerosene, and asphalt are all mixtures of (mostly relatively heavy) hydrocarbons.

IN VITRO FERTILIZATION The fertilization of an egg outside the mother’s body.

ISOTOPE An atom with the same number of protons as a second atom but a different number of neutrons is said to be an isotope of that second atom.

LASER A device that produces an extraordinarily intense beam of light. The word laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of Radiation.

LIGHT-YEAR The distance that light travels in a year, or approximately 5,878,000,000,000 miles.

NATURAL SELECTION The theory that species originate and become differentiated as certain characteristics of organisms prove more valuable than others at enabling those organisms to reproduce. These valuable characteristics are in effect “selected” by nature for preservation in succeeding generations, while other characteristics disappear. Natural selection was a key element in Charles Darwin’s monumental theory of evolution.

NEBULA An enormous cloud of dust and gas in outer space.

NUCLEAR ENERGY The vast energy locked in the infinitesimal nucleus of an atom. This energy can be released through fission (the splitting of certain atomic nuclei) and fusion (the combining of certain atomic nuclei). It is also released naturally in a few elements through a process of decomposition called radioactivity. Fission, fusion, and radioactivity are all processes involving the conversion of small amounts of matter into enormous amounts of energy. The release of this energy is the basis of nuclear weapons (such as atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs) and nuclear reactors used in the production of electricity.

NUCLEAR WINTER A hypothetical chilling of the earth resulting from the contamination of the atmosphere by radioactive materials, dust, and other substances in the aftermath of a nuclear war.

OSMOSIS The equalization of fluid concentrations on both sides of a permeable membrane.

OZONE LAYER Ozone is a compound of oxygen. The ozone layer is a part of the atmosphere that, among other things, filters out radiation that is harmful to human beings. In recent decades the ozone layer has been found to be decomposing at an alarming rate, owing in large part to the release of certain pollutants into the atmosphere.

PASTEURIZATION A sterilization process in which foods are heated in order to kill harmful organisms in them. The process is named for Louis Pasteur, the 19th-century French scientist who developed it.

PERIODIC TABLE A chart depicting the known elements arranged according to certain characteristics—a must-have in chemistry classrooms and textbooks.

PHEROMONE Substances secreted by animals that influence the behavior of other animals, primarily through the sense of smell.

PHOTON The smallest unit of electromagnetic radiation.

PHOTOSYNTHESIS The process whereby green plants transform energy from the sun into food.

PLATE TECTONICS A revolutionary geological theory holding that the earth’s crust consists of enormous moving plates that are constantly shifting position and, among other things, altering the shape and arrangement of the continents.

PULSAR Any of a number of less than thoroughly understood objects in outer space that emit regular pulses of radio waves.

QUASAR Any of a number of starlike objects believed to occupy the very farthest fringes of the universe.

RADIO TELESCOPE A large antenna capable of receiving the radio waves naturally emitted by stars and other objects in outer space. A radio telescope is a telescope capable of “seeing” forms of electromagnetic radiation not visible to the human eye or to an ordinary optical telescope.

RELATIVITY Albert Einstein’s monumental theory, which holds, among a great many other things, that space and time are not separate entities but elements of a single continuum called space time.

RNA An abbreviation for ribonucleic acid, a substance similar to DNA that is a crucial element in the synthesis of proteins.

SEISMOLOGY The study of earthquakes and other tremors (including man-made ones) in the earth’s crust.

SPEED OF LIGHT The speed at which light travels through a vacuum, or 186,282 miles per second.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY The ability of certain substances to conduct electricity with no resistance. Superconductivity has usually been produced by cooling certain substances to temperatures approaching absolute zero. More recently, scientists have discovered materials that become superconductive at vastly warmer temperatures.

THERMODYNAMICS A branch of science concerned with heat and the conversion of heat into other forms of energy.

VACCINE A substance that, when introduced into an organism, causes the organism to produce antibodies against, and hence immunity to, a particular disease.
