- one boom and we're live first of all

cheers gentlemen let's have a little

toast relax Bob thank you very much for

doing this I really appreciate it I

understand that you've told this story

many many times you've been grilled many

many times and it's very stressful for

you so I really really appreciate your

time for people who don't know the story

there is a documentary

Jeremy Korbel it has a documentary out

right now it's called bob lazar area 51

in UFOs and flying saucers and flying

saucers air 51 in flight sometimes I

first heard your story decades ago I've

told you last night we went out to

dinner I've seen pretty much every

interview you've ever given I've

followed the story incredibly closely

but for people who don't know story

let's give them the bullet points you

used to work at area 51 and area 51

you got you you went like huh well you

know we want to be accurate Oh Kerry S 4

s 4 oh just about 15 miles south of area

51 okay um you worked in what would you

how would you describe it I guess

within the area 51 compound you can call

that a subset of area 51 and you got

that job before that you were working

before that I had worked at Los Alamos

right National Labs in New Mexico and

you were involved in what kind of work

the nuclear weapon development physics I

mean that's they do everything there so

how did they approach you to say hey

bomb

once you come on out to the Nevada

desert well the way this went down was

at that time I was 1982 I I put a jet

engine in my my Honda and Los Alamos put

it on the front page of the paper

said you know Los Alamos man physicist

at the lab you know built this 200 mile

an hour you know on the jet car that I

drove to work every day so

I was known in Los Alamos that the guy

with the weird car and you know you

could hear it from you know a mile away

anyway the day that came out on the

front page of the paper was the day

Edward Teller the father of the hydrogen

bomb was giving a lecture down there at

the lab and we didn't have much going on

that day in our group and I asked if I

could go down there and I went down

there early and Ed teller was outside

leaning on a brick wall there and

reading the front page of the paper now

there's a guy out of history so I

introduced myself hey I'm the guy you're

reading about there and we talked for a

little while and it was cool you know

fast forward two years later I had moved

out to Las Vegas and had you know left

Los Alamos and you know went on to other

things and I wanted to get back into the

scientific humanity yeah I left start

other businesses and and that sort of

thing so I sent resumes out and one of

them went out to Ed teller and

referenced our meeting you know back it

back in that the day and anyway he

remembered me and gave me a reference

somebody to contact at EG&G

and that's pretty much how it started so

you get a phone call or a letter like

what do you get well I got a what did I

get I got a letter initially and went

down for an interview probably a couple

times and it was down at EG&G special

projects which was at McCarran Airport

at that time out in Las Vegas and did

they give you any sort of job

description of what you were applying

for they said it was for Edie I can't

remember exactly what they did this was

a long time ago but I I think it was

advanced propulsion or something like

that something relatively generic and

they said it's in a remote area you know

it's gonna be some days on some days off

and you know it was kind of a it was

kind of not exactly a full-time job but

you might have to be out there for two

weeks at a time and take two weeks off

so

kind of uh the work schedule would be

kind of broken up and did this seem

attractive you or did it seem weird no I

really wasn't weird because people that

work at the test site anybody that's

familiar with the area up there you know

working at the nuclear test site or at

the Tonopah test range north of there

that's typically how things go so you

had known about it from the scientific

community because the area 51 at that

time know anything about area 51 okay so

they just said it was in a you know in a

remote location and you just know it was

up at the test site right so but there

was no mention of area 51 at that time

so they've done hundreds of nuclear

tests in Nevada Nevada that that whole

area was there's been just giant chunks

of Nevada the people yeah there's a big

piece of Nevada and it split up into

different areas there's a nuclear test

site

there's area 51 there's the Tonopah test

range north of that there's little sub

areas there's areas where they test

chemical weapons and things like that so

it's all broken up as a you know

gigantic test area so take me back to

first day on the job you accept a job

they take you out there yeah it's the

first day really I didn't really get to

see a whole lot the first day was

essentially just paperwork that's when I

flew into area 51 proper and I left

McCarran Airport and flu what they call

the Janet flights just you know a

passenger plane from Las Vegas to area

51 and it was really just going through

a mountain of paperwork that day from

security clearances to cat there was it

was like two or three hours of just

solid paperwork and that was that was

really an uneventful first day when did

things get weird when did you realize

they at what point in time did you say

hey this is not normal work like this

doesn't even seem like it's from this

planet that I can't tell you what day

that occurred on because so much time

has gone by the days of kind of fusion

to

and I can't listen today's was it a slow

burn or was there a moment of

recognition well they're the the first

inkling I had was when I I came in

normal there's this facility that is at

s4 it's in the side of a mountain and

normally we had pulled in with the bus

and gone around the front through a

normal double door this time that I went

in there were hanger doors open I went

into the hangar door and in the hangar

door was the disk the flying saucer

that I worked on I saw it sitting there

and we walked by a headed little

American flag stuck on the side and I

thought oh my god this finally explains

all the flying saucer stories this is

just an advanced fighter and it this is

[ __ ] hilarious

so I went by I sloughs my hands

alongside it I got reprimanded

immediately for touching the thing and

there was a guy in armed guard that

followed us in and just said keep your

eyes at forward in your hands at your

side and just walk in the door so that

was the first time I had seen anything

that was weird it was sometime later

that I was introduced to my my lab

partner Barry and we had some of the

subcomponents of the craft in the lab

and Barry was very anxious to get a new

lab partner so he was very talkative and

couldn't wait to show me different

things and it was in the demonstration

of the reactor working where it caught

my attention to where this is technology

that doesn't even exist so I mean that

was the first time I knew that this is

really something different what was it

what was it what was a what was it about

this reactor that made you think that it

didn't exist

technologically well it was that I

actually have to back up because there

were some briefings that I read it

before that that you know certainly gave

me the impression that this was going to

be a weird job but this was the first

hands-on thing this was a small reactor

about the size of a hemisphere about the

size of a basketball on a metal plate

and when it was running it produced a

gravitational field a gravitational

field of its own now this is something

that we can't do we can't produce any

gravity the only way we get gravity is

from large quantities of mass but

there's no machine we can have that

turns on that makes gravity like you

know you can turn on an electromagnet

and it makes a magnetic field we can't

make a gravitational field

anyway this device was producing that

and Barry said it's almost like he was

bragging go ahead try and try and touch

the sphere and I I couldn't it would it

pushed my hands away just like two like

poles of a magnet so that was like when

you take two magnets and try to press

them together yeah yeah kind of cushion

feeling but you can't you can't get them

together the closer you put them the

more they push but you felt that

physical with my hand yeah now there's

nothing there's nothing that does that

and that immediately caught my attention

going wow this is something else what

was your thought like when you felt that

and you knew that there was nothing that

you were aware of that could predict

that connected me to the briefings that

I read on the the first day at s4 was

that you know everything that I had read

was apparently accurate what were you

reading I read it was kind of an

overview this project was to back

engineer the alien craft and

specifically it was to try and back

engineer and see if we can duplicate the

technology with available materials now

to do this they split the project into

you know many different pieces for

several reasons they do this on all

classified project so nobody has the

complete story but they compartmentalize

everything now we had the power and

propulsion system

so what briefings they gave me were like

a one or two page overview of some of

the other projects that were going on

you know on the craft the only reason

they do that is just in case what you're

working on is connected intimately in

some way that we don't know of - one of

the other projects you have to know

there excuse me their existence so you

know I bet again everything from

metallurgy

- you know weapon potential the craft

and these were all you know essentially

very short briefings but mine was just

power and propulsion and it made it very

clear that what I read was accurate so

when you're reading that before you

actually saw the reactor what were your

thoughts on what they were describing if

you knew that something like that didn't

exist and they're describing it in the

briefings what did you think you were

gonna see I really I didn't know at the

time I mean I was reading I thought is

this is some kind of test see if you're

crazy well not to see if I'm crazy - you

know a lot of times they'll take in real

high security jobs I mean they'll

intentionally insert nonsense into him

whether it's to confuse the fact or if

for someone was to leak it out they

would carry that information along and

know where it came from so I read

through the documents but you know I

didn't know if this was you know part of

some kind of test or you know or what or

was it potentially realistic I mean I'd

really didn't consider it being all that

possible as far as being the actual

thing that I was going to work on at the

time how did they turn it on there the

reactor yeah the reactor can be turned

on or turned off in a lot of different

ways the way Barry showed me it the

hemisphere is removed there's a small

tower in the middle when you put the

hemisphere on the reactor activates the

reactor shuts down its its load sensing

so if there's if there's no load on the

reactor at all it shuts down when

there's a load present on it it starts

up again load meaning you can consider

it an electrical load so although it

doesn't necessarily operate electrically

there's no wiring that connects any of

the sub components together whatsoever

they just have to be in the immediate

vicinity it's a it is but the stuff is

borderline magic and that's essentially

where we left it

you know when I left the project so

there was no progress made there was

some progress I mean we did identify at

least we think some processes and and

had a rough idea we think of what was

going on but I think this is a problem

that they've had for a long time and you

know I was replacing somebody that Barry

worked with prior to me and I think

there was some horrific accident that I

didn't have a whole lot of information

on but you know Barry alluded to that a

horrific accident like where someone

died or yeah where somebody died because

they were trying to tamper with things

or figure out how something worked yeah

the reactor in particular but yet he let

you touch it yeah I think what they were

trying to do was cut into one now they

had they had more than one there and I

that was supposedly there was an

unannounced nuclear test and that's what

it was at the time remember they would

still do an underground nuclear test at

the test site but from what I understand

according to Barry there was an attempt

made now this must have been a pretty

desperate attempt because it's not a

very scientific process to cut you know

analyze something that way but it looked

like they used a plasma cutter or

something I got to cut into an exactor

how many of these things they have they

had nine nine craft altogether I only

got hands-on with one of them so I can't

really say what the how the others

operated you see the other ones yeah at

one time and only one time the bay doors

that between the hangars were all open

and I could see all the way through and

were they all exactly the same no they

were all different different shapes yeah

but they were all from somewhere else

yeah absolutely now did anyone make any

attempt to explain or to to tell you

where they came from no no no one is the

least bit interested in letting

everybody know all the facts they want

to give you the minimum information

that's necessary to complete your task

so you're not getting the story of where

they came from you're not getting the

story of what how much progress other

people are making you just focus on

the small component but they gave you

some indication that they've been

working on these for a while yeah when

do you think they acquired these I

really couldn't say I think they've been

around for a while so they bring you

into this room you see this reactor

working you you realize this is nothing

that as far as like the scientific

community at current time has the

ability to create wait you still don't

what is your life like from that moment

on is that where everything changes

because you do I mean I would imagine

the moment you actually make contact

with something that's extraterrestrial

whether it's an object or a being

something where you can actually

absolutely be certain it's not from here

your whole paradigm the whole world you

live in is now a different place well

this is the only time it became exciting

you know the rest of the time though it

was really an an ominous feeling being

at work but it at that time it was

exciting I mean this was now I knew we

were on the absolute beyond actually

beyond the cutting edge of science and I

was I was so absolutely excited to be

there every single time I was you know

it with this was a fantastic opportunity

and however in in short order it began

to concern me we really have no idea

what we're talking about and the

excitement kind of turned to dread at

some point because the amount of power

we're dealing with is astronomical

I mean to affect gravity to produce the

effects like this equipment does takes

huge amounts of power and I've given the

example before of you know taking a

small portable nuclear reactor and you

know putting it back into Victorian

times you know with the scientists at

the time and just dropping it in a room

and they come and look at it and see

that it's producing power and wonder how

it works so they start taking it apart

and as soon as they get some of the

shielding off the people are going to

drop dead because of the radiation

inside now the people have no idea that

it radiation even exists back then but

anybody that comes in to check on them

will also drop dead and you know there's

no reason that that exact scenario

couldn't happen with what we're dealing

with we have no idea

how the physics operate within this

thing the power levels are art like I

said astronomic like it's incredibly

dangerous to tinker with something like

that and you know in some respects we

were guinea pigs just try to find out

how to make this thing so they had a

series as far as you surmised that a

series of different scientists try to

back engineer this thing try to figure

out what this thing was and they would

bring in new people and like let's throw

Bob at it yeah yeah and they I know I

don't know how many but I knew there was

certainly one before me and I knew he

died during the analysis of the or the

reactor itself and you don't know how

many have worked on it and no one gave

this could have been there for 50 years

it could have been there for five years

when they give you instructions

what are they saying like when they're

giving you direction they're showing you

all this stuff like what what what are

they saying well specifically what are

they asking of you well essentially what

they ask is is what I said we are just

to gather as much information as

possible find out how it operates and

see if we can duplicate it so but they

notice relays you where it was from they

never let you ask questions about where

it's from well if the information I read

in the briefings was accurate now what I

do have to say is the information that

pertained directly to the reactor was

accurate what I read did I mean did jive

with reality in terms of how in terms of

how it was made how what we saw how it

operated the materials how it you know

turned on and what was discovered

discovered about it I'm sorry the

migraine is really making it hard for me

to thank you sorry no we we talked that

before the podcast you tell everybody

Bob

getting a migraine I know you're very

stressed out by this is just one of the

reasons why I appreciate you doing this

where was I already we're talking right

the plaintiff and so there was some

paperwork that indicated that this was

from the Zeta Reticuli star system now

yeah now how they obtained that I

haven't I haven't the slightest idea but

it wasn't just from the Zeta Reticuli

star system it was what they called zr3

so it was a third planet in that star

system so there was no other information

about it other than that supposedly

where the craft came from now was that

true I don't know I have no way of

verifying that but that was printed in

the same materials that referenced the

reactor now I looked that stuff up when

I went home and Zeta Reticuli is a

binary star two stars that orbit orbit

one another and it's only visible in the

southern hemisphere and it's about

thirty some-odd light-years away

so that's literally all the information

I have about that I don't know how they

found out it came from there and you

also probably have some suspicions that

they give you some disinformation like

you were talking about before yeah yeah

I mean if you ever decided to talk about

this they added a bunch of nonsense to

make whatever is factual look ridiculous

right or be able to trace it down like

okay this fax came out and you know this

Lazar guy said okay you know came from

Zeta Reticuli so they knew it was when

he read Isaiah reticulate we like what

in the [ __ ] is this well reading all of

the stuff it was what kind of [ __ ] is

this you like why did I sign up for this

no no I would dit to me this was cool

this was interesting I said I was just

excited to be out in a secure area you

know in the middle of the desert is

awesome how old are you I get as in my

20s yeah so you probably totally geeked

out oh yeah it's that this was this was

great I mean I was excited so I didn't

care I'm reading through everything and

so you read through all the Zeta

particularly thing but then when you see

the actual starship with the little

American flag sticker on it

well that was was that later or before

that

that was before so before so you see the

thing before you say oh that's that

before it's hard so many years yeah I

can't either way it doesn't matter the

days have fused together it's so hard to

separate what happened in each visit do

you remember the thought process when

you read that it's from Zeta Reticuli

yeah it it it it didn't hit me like a

ton of bricks or anything is just like

yeah okay [ __ ] I don't know

these were now I don't I mean because

when I read it I hadn't verified

anything and this was just a bunch of

stuff I was reading and I thought maybe

after this they're just gonna give me a

test and see what I can remember and

write crazy information and it would but

like I said when I finally went in with

Barry and had hands-on experience with

what they were talking about it took on

a completely different meaning so

there's a plate there's this thing that

looks like half a basketball and when

it's on you can't come anywhere near it

you can't touch it right how is what is

gravity about that like the concept of

gravity most people's gravity is

bringing something towards it right well

I guess you would say it's anti-gravity

it's gravity shifted 180 degrees it's a

you know antigravity and did they have

any understanding about what could

possibly create this effect did they

have any areas where they'd like you to

look into no they well they knew there

was a fuel source in it and they were

proficient at making it work and again

my analogy to something like this is you

can drop a motorcycle off in the wagon

train days and just leave it with the

keys parked outside you know somebody's

place everybody will come around it and

they'll poke and prod and eventually

they'll turn the key get it to start and

become proficient at writing it yeah but

they won't be able to understand what

the hell's going on they won't be able

to make the plastic fender much less

anything else and I think that's exactly

the state we were at we played around

with the parts long enough before I got

there where they could make the reactor

operate

take the fuel out and know that it makes

it work how exactly what was going on in

the reactor remained a mystery at the

time I think we made some progress on

what was going on inside but I don't

think anybody really knew anything they

could just watch what was going on and

make note of it

how long were there I'd say about six

months or so and what what progress

admit was made while you were there well

we came up with a bunch of reasonably

good ideas about how the reactor worked

and one of them was the base the square

base of it was essentially like a

cyclotron which is a small particle

accelerator a circular one particle

accelerators of linear particle

accelerators are just a you know long

tube essentially in the accelerate

particles with high voltage and you know

radio frequencies till they reach high

speeds but a cyclotron does that in a

small circular area and there's this

very heavy element fuel element 115

something that wasn't on our periodic

charts at the time but it is now it is

now yeah when did it become on the

periodic table now the way their charts

now you know I don't remember do you

remember when they 2004 Durham Germany I

think is where they first advocated for

atoms that lasted 220 milliseconds the

atoms it's nothing right and then later

was discovered a couple more times they

could fabricate it then they gave it

they gave it a place then on the

Periodic Chart

after that called it moscovia so they

told you about this stuff in 1982 yeah

well what what year was this it was 80

88 and 89 when I was there 82 is 182 it

was near Los Alamos I'm sorry yeah so 88

89 they told you about this stuff so

this was not like no they didn't they

didn't tell me about it that's one of

the things that this group came up with

mmm the guy I keep losing my train of

thought with this thing so this one area

this this element 115 was the fuel yeah

it was the fuel that the world will

forgive you for having a migraine yes

really I didn't think that'd give you

more person so I say what yeah

definitely as I said one thing you know

bought for the last 30 years people have

just been on the attack on Bob you know

getting to know him the personal effects

on his life it's really hard to

understand unless you meet his family

and his wife I mean this is the last

thing he wanted to [ __ ] do was have

to talk yeah we should explain that

chairman the you and I had this

conversation I watched a documentary we

had this conversation and I said I have

to talk to him

yeah the document there was there's been

detractors there's been a bunch of

people that called [ __ ] on many of

the things that you've said but over

time many of the things that you talked

about even in the 80s have proven to be

true things that people said we're not

true were proven to be true element 115

was one of them right right right

element 115 the fuel they had was stable

in other words it didn't decay it wasn't

emitting radioactivity when they

synthesized two or three atoms of the

115 it did decay and it was not a stable

element so they're they're kind of two

different things but this is kind of

typical elements always have or pretty

much always have stable isotopes and

unstable isotopes like I think cesium

has like 30 unstable isotopes to it so

all right well hydrogen for example

you're familiar with hydrogen gas it's

stable it's not radioactive but there's

also two other types of hydrogen

deuterium and tritium and deuterium

isn't radioactive it's another stable

isotope of hydrogen but tritium is

radioactive now they're all hydrogen but

they just have different amounts of

neutrons so it's the same thing with

other elements and element 115 depending

on the amount of neutrons it has

designates the isotope but it's 115 they

will continue to take

or experiment and try and make 115 at

different isotopes and I'm sure

eventually they'll come up with a stable

version but it's the taste stable

version that has the properties that

we're talking about so they somehow or

another had acquired a stable version

did they say that the stable version had

come with this crap it absolutely came

with the graft yeah so at the time you

having a firm knowledge of the periodic

chart and knowing what was real and what

wasn't real what was your reaction to

having this stable element 115 that

wasn't even supposed to exist well

everything was impossible right I mean

down down to the metal I I did get a

chance to look inside the craft on only

one occasion and this was important

because where the reactor sat might have

been critical to how it operated since

everything operates without any

interconnections so the placement of

components might be critical so they

allowed me to go inside and and look at

it again I forgot where the hell I am so

you're going into this craft and what

are you thinking when you're inside of

it like what are you seeing it's a it's

a very ominous feeling because it's

there are no at first of all everything

is one color it's like a dark pewter

color and there are no right angles

anywhere it's as if somebody took I've

said this before somebody took a model

out of and fashioned it out of wax and

then heated it just for a short time so

everything melted everything looks like

it's fused together everything has a

radius of curvature were two items meet

it's it's a really weird looking thing

but there was almost nothing other than

a small foldable hatchway that that

looked recognizable everything was uh

was really unworldly to pick on it a way

to describe it so you you get inside

this thing and it's designed for

something that's much smaller than a

human being

yeah you can't really stand up till you

get to the very center of how tall you

I'm five ten

and what do you think this was designed

for I'd say something close to half my

height Wow so these little three-foot

tallest creatures yeah and that the

seats were small too I mean obviously it

was made you know for something

something small but there is no like

there's there's nothing else in there

there's just seats the reactor and some

of the sub components there's no there's

no control panels there's no bathroom

there's no no decorative components or

artwork or anything that you would

recognize or trim I mean it's just a

very bare-bones thing you're not seeing

any screens

well there are archways around it at

that a part of the superstructure and

that one of the archways can become

transparent when I was in there there

was another group working on one of the

archways and you could call that a

screen more or less so through that

archway it would be it would maintain

the solidity the the solid whatever

metal it was yeah but you could just

became transparent yeah I saw that

happen once or twice before I left

did you ask any questions about what the

phone no there's no ask question now but

when you watch something become

transparent and you realize it's still

there but you could now see through it

yeah I mean no that's not that

impressive we do have some liquid

crystal materials that are like that you

know smart glass yeah they call it smart

class so this is just and I don't know

if the craft is made of you know an

advanced metal or a ceramic it was cold

to the touch so um you know I would lean

more towards a metal you're not allowed

to ask questions no the only way work on

the buddy system so I can only exchange

ideas and talk to Barry now this really

interferes with science because science

is based on free discussion and ideally

you get a bunch of guys together

exchange ideas work on problems and

that's how things move forward but

they're so over-the-top concerned about

security they split everything off and

everybody becomes stagnant it it it

destroys any of the progress you can

make or at least makes it go so slow

they I think they wind up shooting

themselves in the foot which is probably

why they arrived at this bottleneck that

they need to get this madman with a

jet-powered Honda come in and see what

he could do I think that was an act of

desperation I think they wanted someone

that's thinks out of the box and let's

just give this guy a try here because

they weren't and they might have done

this four more times since you know up

to the point in time today assuming

they're still working on this thing and

when you see this craft and you're

inside was there any indication that

there was an area that they would use to

control it to pilot was there a pilot

seat whizzers

there were three seats they sat around

the reactor was in the dead center of it

and then equidistant around there were

three seats so that's all the there was

a large you would they're not consoles

there are large rectangular objects also

spaced equidistant around the center

there's nothing on them there's no

button that there's no lights and they

litter all same color this everything is

the same color different shape right and

directly underneath them there's three

levels in the craft the main level is

what we're talking about directly under

that those are the gravity amplifiers

the big rectangular objects underneath

them are the gravity of midders that

look like for lack of a better word a

trash can hanging on a pipe three of

those and then the top layer I this is

just my personal belief I think that has

to do with a navigation or their version

of a computer with some planar panels

sensor panels around the craft that we

would call portholes but they're not

portholes they're just black areas and I

think that just determines its you know

position in space but I was I was in the

center section and I stuck my torso in

the bottom section and hung upside down

so I could see how the gravity

amplifiers were positioned what is they

the roughly the size of this thing it's

I think it I don't

member from being there but after all

the stuff was over I had John Andrews a

guy from the testers model corporation

and you know we sat down and tried to

figure out from what I saw and known

sizes of things and we came up with 52

feet in diameter I think that's always

small yeah so I think that's a fair

reasonable guess now you said there's

nine of them and you got a brief glimpse

at the other ones were they how were

they different Oh

they looked completely different one

looked like I called a jello mold and it

it looked like a classic jello mold with

the rippled sides do it one was a very

flat disc you know like oh I don't like

a straw hat or something like that that

was sitting up on its edge and the thin

part of it had looked like a projectile

had been fired through the edge of it so

I don't know if they were attempting to

see if the metal could be penetrated or

if something or if that's where the

thing came from maybe it was shot down

but that was the only one where I saw

there was you know actual physical

damage to it and that one was roughly

the same size they're all high they were

kind of too far away to tell mm-hmm and

did there was several teams that were

working on the propulsion system so

there was different teams that were

working on these different our aircrafts

I I don't don't know I could only assume

now when you're sitting in this thing

and you're looking at this otherworldly

craft your your goal is to try to figure

out how this thing functions your goal

is to try to figure out how this reactor

I mean he would imagine they would give

you more time than just one day to check

that out oh yeah it wasn't one day right

yeah I mean this is Barry was there

I think Barry was sleeping there I'm

sure they had now that that isn't weird

I mean Oh put the Tonopah test range

where they work on stealth fighters you

know you go I think three weeks on one

week off and you stay up there too so

it's not weird to stay up with the test

site right so yeah you think he prettier

than he

did like he's been up there for a long

time yeah but I'm still there yeah oh no

so you do you have contact with this guy

no oh no I wish I did I kind of thought

he was gonna come out after I did right

and I think I took so much flak and it's

so much [ __ ] for what went on I think I

actually I wound up helping security

there and everybody became afraid of you

know doing or saying anything after that

so what kind of reports did you have to

give like so you're not making much

progress right you're just trying to

figure out what this thing is and it

seems impossible

so well we didn't personally make them I

mean we were always there was never a

lot of information that we gained the

guy you would call him our supervisor or

his name was Dennis Mariani and kind of

a military looking guy and he would

routinely pop in you know during the day

and you know hey what's going on guys

and he would essentially relay any

information anything new we came up with

I mean he was our goal between you know

where we presented him the information

then he took it to wherever they were

you know assembling all the data from

everybody know I assume you're working

normal day so I can eight-hour day no no

no it was really weird that I would be

only called in on certain times in

certain days and they would be weird

hours too

most of the time was later in the

evening I mean I can get a call with 11

o'clock at night and they'll say you

know it's now 11 o'clock by 11:45 you

need to be at McCarran Terminal and you

know we'll let you know when we have

more information but what did you do

while you were there if you're looking

at this object this reactor and you

can't figure out what it is or how it

works other than the fact that works on

this element that we don't even know

about sure I mean the thing was - that

what you do and you know with anything

if you're trying to analyze it all you

can do is perform tests and all we did

is try and come up with every kind of

test we possibly could I mean we tested

you know

it violated a lot of what we thought was

impossible to violate I mean one of the

first laws of thermodynamics I mean

essentially any machine any device that

operates always makes extra heat nothing

works at a hundred percent efficient

even the headphones you're wearing

anything that takes power some of that

power is going to be converted to heat

and it's just wasted this didn't I mean

we looked at back then we had infrared

cameras they're different today but back

then you had a pour liquid nitrogen into

the camera to cool the sensor down and

and get these infrared images you've

seen but it never got no matter what the

load was on the reactor it never got

above ambient temperature which is

impossible I mean you're you know

pulling out huge amounts of power and

nothing ever gets warm

we tried measuring magnetic fields and

there was was nothing there so we

started playing around with the emission

from the emitter is the gravity wave

itself and saw what we could do with it

and how it was focused so we really

spent all our time just trying to see

what the stuff can do and what we can

control so you were seeing what it could

do but you couldn't ever figure out how

it was doing it no not really I mean we

really we really could only use a come

up with a best guess and now I can't say

we really I that I could absolutely

state for certainly very certainty how

anything actually worked now how did you

know at all how they were piloting it

because some they were doing some tests

where they were having these things fly

around in the sky and this is what gets

us deeper into your story

right I was out there for one test right

in fact I was in with Barry in the lab

and Dennis came in and said we're about

to run a test why don't you guys come

out or I think he said Barry wedding

you come out here and bring Bob with you

we went out there and the craft was

already outside the hangar and was just

preparing to lift off now they were in

communication with somebody in the craft

so there was a person in there

yeah there was certainly a person in

there now it's not a comfortable place

to be in because it's small so the guy

has to be sitting on the floor in the

middle my best guess and this is the

same specific craft that you know that

was because you were the that was the

only craft that you were the only one

that I touched and worked on and it it

quietly lifted off the ground which

wasn't incredibly impressive to see

quietly or silently what's well quietly

because it it produced a little Corona

discharge from the bottom a corona

discharge is kind of a high voltage

brush little bluish glow discharge as it

was lifting off the ground you can hear

a slight hiss sound now as soon as it

cleared the ground by about five or ten

feet maybe even less than that the

hissing stopped and the blue go

disappeared so it lifted off quietly and

then it hovered silently if you want to

be specific Wow so then what kind of

maneuvers was it doing it took for that

particular time it took off moved a

little round around to the left and

right and then sat back down the the

craft itself they communicated with it

with a rake because I saw the guy

talking and a regular VHF radio to the

person in the craft and I even saw the

frequency that was on the frequency

counter of the communication the

transceiver there but what's weird is he

shouldn't be able to communicate with

the craft with a radio the radio the

radio waves should Bend around the craft

I mean it shouldn't be possible every

single thing about these the craft and

the way they operated didn't make any

sense to us I mean that's something we

talked about for a while after why

should the frequency Bend around the

craft

well you really have to look at the way

the gravity wave comes out of the craft

as a the reactors in the center and

there's a waveguide that goes up to the

top there's actually a small appendage

that sticks out at the top of the craft

and it produces a heart-shaped

gravitational distortion around the

craft now if the craft is sitting in the

air and you walk underneath it and look

up you actually cannot see the craft the

light bends around it you're bending

gravity bends light it bends radio waves

it's um it it shouldn't be possible to

communicate with a craft that has an

envelope around it that's distorting all

forms of energy but they were apparently

in contact with it somehow or another

through some unexplained way but they

bother explain to you so this thing gets

up it just does some very simple

maneuvers left-right left-right Goes

Down and did they discuss this with you

I mean they said they wanted you to see

it no they just wanted no they didn't

discuss anything with me it said it sat

down we looked around for a bit and

Barry said let's go back we went back in

the lab all we got to do is see it fast

forward to some months later I did have

the test flight schedule of the craft

now they had times they had designated

high performance tests this obviously

wasn't one that was a high performance

test the high performance test went goes

above the mountain range and they do

much more radical moves with the thing

look this is a prized item and they're

not doing anything like taking it out of

the atmosphere or flying around other

countries or anything like this

they just play with this thing right

over the test site but they were doing

some radical moves with it and since I

had the test flight scheduled

statistically the amount of traffic and

the surrounding areas on the highway was

lowest on Wednesdays and that's why

Denny Dennis told us that all the test

flights occurred only on Wednesdays

because it'd be the least chance that

anyone would see what's going on and

this was before the

the government had expanded the

forbidden territory around area 51 and

Papoose Lake and all that stuff right

yeah I think that occurred after my

story came out then people started going

up on the mountaintops and trying to

look down into there

and they kind of freaked out and then

did the land grab and pushed everybody

back but yeah that I think all that

occurred long after I'm sorry that I

came out so you're working there and

while you're working there you're under

this crazy schedule but forgive me for

explaining your story but you would get

these phone calls you would have to go

to the to the airport at 11:00 p.m. and

your wife started thinking that you were

having an affair yeah apparently so now

I did give my permission to have you

know as part of the you know security

clearance process

I gave written permission to have the

phones monitored and things of that sort

so they weren't doing any covert stuff

they you know with any Q clearance tour

which is civilian top secret clearance

or military top secret clearance they go

talk to friends and you know play places

you've been make sure you're not

connected to foreign countries but you

know monitoring your phone is nothing

unusual

however they insisted that you know you

don't even talk to your loved one to

your partner to your wife whatever about

what's going on so she was essentially

in the dark and didn't know the phone

was being monitored well part of the

security clearance is that not only do

you not have any connections to foreign

countries and are in a maniac but you

have to have a stable home life - well

she started having an affair with a

flight instructor now they were

monitoring this on the phone and they

knew it and I didn't so they stopped me

coming in and their attitude at the time

was we need to see how this is going to

play out

and if Lazar is gonna get a little weird

or anything so let's just you know hold

him off from coming in and you

see what happens and they explain this

to you what was happening well after the

fact yeah cuz time kind of went on and

there were guys that were following me

around and I started getting a little

concerned going well [ __ ] they booted

me out of the project and if so they're

not just gonna let me hang out at home

and go get a new job knowing what I know

so as time went on I started getting a

little concerned and I took my closest

friends and just kind of got together I

said hey remember that job I told you

about this is what's going on and like

you don't need to take my word for it

Wednesday night we need to all go out

here I want to show you what's going on

so I took everybody and we went out to

remember since I had the test flight

scheduled and went outside the base out

into the desert and so everybody could

see you know one of the high performance

tests and you know it left quite an

imprint on everybody so they knew I

wasn't and there's videos of these tests

right yeah but remember this isn't that

it's in in the dark in the 80s of the

big monster sized camcorder and you got

you know a bright light jumping around

but yeah I mean we did video of a but

there's no by today's standards it's but

it's your video specifically available

the video that you took

yeah well George Knapp has it it's is it

an argument now do you I have no idea

Jeremy yeah show clips of it in my film

it's it's online and someone did a deep

analysis of it it was interesting to

take a look at how well this microphone

up to face about a fish from your face

right you know to see how his video

looks now but as far as video evidence I

mean we are talking 80s camp words the

most important thing is the human story

here everybody that he took up there on

three separate occasions they don't all

like each other they don't all talk they

all agree on one thing they saw

something that night at the exact point

in time and space that Bob Lazar said

and remember this is 1715 seventy miles

south of area 51 no one even knew really

about area 51 we're talking Papoose Lake

and they all agree they saw something

that night they had never seen before

and they've

ever seen sense right when he said it so

that's one of like the six things where

I'm like how did he know you can dismiss

him I dismiss it but some things we

can't get around and and there's about

five or six of them how did he know

about if Jamie wants to find that video

right now what would you look under Bob

Lazar UFO s for area 51 just kind of

like that so it's like this s for UFO

video bob lazar and god does an analysis

but you're analyzing these 80's videos

he from the very beginning Bob never

said I have proof of my store and I'm

going to tell the world he said at the

very beginning I cannot prove my story

that's not why I'm telling this George

Knapp convinced him to tell people and

he lived to it and I I didn't believe it

either until I talked with George okay

so you you filmed these this test flight

one test flight and then you get caught

actually it was I think the third time

because we went out there the first time

mmm

everybody saw it everybody was amazed

because it did some radical maneuvers

and you know everybody had a lot to say

but new vers that i've seen i've seen

the video it doesn't I don't think

there's something we have now that does

that know in terms of like a human

piloted craft I mean I don't know

obviously with the governor it's

impossible nothing can move like that

and remember we didn't start filming

from the very beginning you know at the

core we were waiting for something you

know to happen the craft took off and I

came flying at a stopped you know turned

it or I angle flew back and then you

know after did some you know amazing

stuff to get the camera and then we

started filming so it doesn't have all

of it on there just has some the way I

describe it to my friends and they said

what is I said take a laser pointer and

then have a wall and then move it around

the wall like you know how it moves

around the wall it doesn't seem like it

has anything to do with inertia or

physics or it's not an impeded in any

way by the atmosphere yeah that's what

it looked at you're essentially

separated from reality as crazy as that

sounds with being in in case its own

gravitational envelope inertia is not

going to affect it and you know this is

this is how some of those recent

sightings would commander David flavor

I'm sure you've heard of this exact you

a UFO I mean he describes exactly that

the thing operates exactly the way I was

describing that's why he was interested

to talk to me but we saw this and you

know on the way home it's like way we

got away with it we should try it again

the next test flight day so this became

a thing to do and I think it was on the

third time that we got caught I mean we

started becoming a little careless I

think we took a Motorhome out there you

know I mean it was like the stupidest

thing you could possibly tell Gaytan

yeah it was ridiculous and again you're

in your 20s yeah and you know what was

funny was we went out there and my

friend Jean Huff and I were leaning on

the front of a vehicle and just for some

reason we just started talking jet like

well I hope they realized that I don't

remember what we were saying but you

know that it's something about attacking

the base or something along those lines

and stealing the craft or something like

that so I'm crazy and then about 20 feet

in front of us we see a little green

light fall on the ground and roll to us

and unbeknownst to us now it's pitch

black you can't see your hand in front

of your face there are a bunch of guards

standing right out there and they had a

night-vision scope where they were like

from here to the wall looking at us

listening to us and the guy dropped it

and the scope rolled over to us and you

could see the green screen we turned the

lights on and all these guys are there

so it was whoa yeah yeah so we did

incredibly stupid stuff and got caught

as we should have because so when they

catch you and they bring you in then

what happens well I went in for

debriefing the following day I went to

Indian Springs Air Force Base which is

kind of a defunct base that they used to

use at the nuclear test site and this is

when they brought out the transcript of

the phone call with my wife

and you know they sat me down and we

said you know when we meant to keep the

secret we meant you can't tell your

friends right you know and it just being

sarcastic and trying to mmm and then

they got real serious but this is where

they you know took the transcript out

and we're reading me what my wife and

you know our friend we're talking about

and it was our dime so what happens from

there what do they do with you

why don't they arrest you I don't think

I don't know I don't know why I'm not

sure they exactly they knew what to do

but they did let me go that night and I

went home and that this is kind of when

the most stressful part started because

you're realizing you're being bombed

yeah no yeah now I know not only am I

being monitored but now I know I'm in

trouble and it wasn't a short time after

that that I contacted you know at that

time the only investigative reporter I

had heard of in Las Vegas was George

Knapp and you know told him some of the

story because I had no idea what the

hell was gonna happen at that point so

George Knapp tries to dissect your story

tries to find holes in it tells it puts

it online and makes everybody aware of

it and that's how I found out about it

yeah to make a long story short well

what happens yet to really make a long

story short what happens from there on I

mean do they contact you and say hey Bob

it's probably a good idea if you shut up

how they try to label you as crazy was

there there a boy there are a lot of

things that happened at you know between

that point I'm leaving out a lot of

stuff to fill in the story we'd have to

go back to Los Alamos and and well I

really don't want to talk about that the

top-secret weapons stuff that you were

working on

no I'm talking about the 115 um well I

don't know I have to think about how

what is the problem I don't want to get

myself into more trouble by admitting

something so I just have to dance around

a couple great just during the filming

of the movie piano but the movies great

by the way thanks Jay and it's on

Netflix right now if anyone who wants to

check it out and if you're one of those

people like me who you know I've always

loved the idea of UFOs I became

extremely weary talking to people who

are UFO believers and UFO fanatics cuz

there's so many of them they're full of

[ __ ] and not just full of [ __ ] they're

they're childishly delirious like the

way they talk about things I mean

there's so many people that are that I'm

in contact they reach me in the night

and they explained to me what we're

doing to the ocean is wrong and like you

know like okay this is one of the

reasons I didn't want to do the show I'm

sure it's no it's I mean it's no joke

we've had people literally camp out on

our front lawn and you know in some ways

I can relate to some of these people you

know maybe some of them did really have

some kind of experience or saw something

and if all their friends think they're

crazy but hey now there's this guy I

heard on the radio and Latinos I'm not

full of [ __ ] so I got to talk to him and

so most of the correspondents I get are

people trying to get a hold of me come

on Bob you you got to listen to me I'm

I'm coming to talk to you I'm you know

I'm driving from Oklahoma or whatever

and and and but some of them are just

[ __ ] batshit crazy I'm yeah they're

frightening there's a lot of

schizophrenic that are involved in the

conspiracy world there's a lot of people

that have real issues Joe I it would be

a disservice to your audience to not say

that we have to look at what's going on

now and understand I've heard on your

show a bunch of stuff about what's going

on now and to not really understand

what's going on now you can't see Bob's

story in the correct light after 30

years and at some point we should just

touch upon that the the biggest being

that things like the tick tock UFO case

that came out I've heard people even on

the show say oh there's a glitch in the

radar that's a data poor

perspective you just don't know yet

what's really going on commander flavor

I was able to get the interview with him

to talk with him way before it became

public I I got that from him he saw it

other pilots saw it this is a big thing

that's going on right now they had more

sightings on the East Coast recently

cubes with with spherical or these are

not aerodynamic and these are the people

we trust to defend us on 9/11

commander favor protected Los Angeles on

9/11 so we trust them but they're not

trained observers radar individuals see

these things and the big the big one

just to throw down so we can consider a

story a little differently there's more

depth to it the big one is the United

States government has admitted that they

have been continuously studying the UFO

phenomenon that program was called a tip

advanced eros or sorry was called AUSA

that that's the mother program George

Knapp got that out they announced

through the New York Times about a tip

but all set these acronyms awesome

advanced aerospace weapon systems

applications program who cares that was

the mother program so they've admitted

we didn't stop studying UFOs in 1969

with Project Blue Book we don't think

it's crazy we're actually want to

reverse engineer the technology that's

why on your other show you said what's

this AAV thing it's like they're making

up another UFO name well hold on there's

a reason because in the documents the

DIA documents that George Knapp released

that everybody said was faked till now

they know is real they call them a AVS

which is advanced aerospace vehicles

people are getting acronyms wrong so

they're the reason for the terminology

change is so that we can mimic what

we're reading in the DIA documents

people can look for that now so they

changed the names to get people away

from UFO or UAP even like Hillary

Clinton said on air right so what he's

talking about Howard grunts I'm Hillary

Clinton informed the public on Jimmy

Kimmel Oh Jimmy we don't call them UFOs

anymore we call them UA AP's

unidentified aerial phenomenon right so

she kind of was giving there the

Clintons are very into the UFO topic

Senator Reid you know he he's done a lot

for the for the subject the study of it

right so she informed the public so they

could look for the right term so these

terms are important because the

dia in those documents they've been

calling them a a vs for quite some time

now and they changed the name to

anomalous no that that's a miss no no so

they always mess around with things but

it's actually advanced right but they're

describing it in the news they were

calling an anomalous vehicle totally and

that's cool they were also saying

anomalous aerospace threats AAT right

because they want the sense of a threat

so my point is all of it if people don't

know this now and they think this stuff

is is fantasy this this part of it that

we're studying it that we take it

seriously we're spending money on it and

that we're getting great data from from

visual pilots to to radar that's why we

know it's aerospace they dropped from

80,000 feet but guess what that's the

top scope of the spy-1 radar is 80,000

feet so the radar system they were using

it was coming from above that so my

point is this if you don't understand

that this is happening you're just

behind the curve because you don't have

the information because of the stigma

that you're talking about I saw you get

totally upset with UFO topic I met you

first when you get totally upset with

UFO topic it's the people when when

you're doing your I'm sorry man when

you're when you're doing your show you

know the jargon questions everything I

could see how how frustrating is trust

me I have been frustrated too how

luckily my mentors George Knapp and he's

taught me the Pitts Paul pitfalls as I

went through it my whole point in this

rant right here is just that we have to

now look at Bob's story but knowing the

facts not someone saying it's a bird

it's a plane it's a glitch they're not

and so if you don't know that you just

don't have the information yeah I'm not

just that knowing the facts as we know

him in 2019 not 1988 absolutely and so

what is he said that has come true he's

totally unimpressed with it right what

does he said this come true so I was

like Bob they've announced gravity as a

wave you were right and you're

vindicated and he looks at mean he's

like well if you think about it Jeremy I

had like a 50-50 chance he was not very

impressed right when did they announce

gravity as a wave so they detected in a

sense they attempted gravity waves now

who is they

you might know more there's two black

holes that were colliding and that's how

they were able to detect yeah somebody

bill I don't know which group it was or

what part of the government

that's what Google's fourth yeah what it

but they you know built a gigantic

gravity wave detector and pretty much

detected that there are such things as

first observation of gravitational waves

it says it was in 2016

ok the first observation of

gravitational waves was made on 14th of

September 2015 rather as announced by

the Li geo and Virgo collaborators on

11th of February 2016

previously gravitational waves had only

been inferred indirectly via their

effect on the timing of pulsars in

binary star systems Danton

Tom the wave form connected by both Li

geo LIGO observatories master

predictions of general relativity for

gravity for a gravitational wave

emanating from the inwards I'm trying to

get this from the inward spiral and

merger of a pair of black holes around

36 and 29 solar masses and the

subsequent ring down of the single

resulting black hole well that I mean

yes no he was on in the 80s the

predominant theory was gravity is

produced by gravitons okay you know part

of theoretical particles but they're not

they're waves they're not particles and

that's so the thought is that the way we

experience gravity it's based on mass

which is why the moon which is roughly

one-quarter the size of the earth has

1/6 of the Earth's gravity so there's

some sort of a computation you can make

based on mass right and and remember we

can observe the effects of gravity but

we have no idea what it is all we can do

is observe it and we can't make it the

only way you can make gravity is just

put more mass together it's just a

product of gravity but if you can make a

if you have a machine that makes gravity

you can pretty much do anything you can

affect time you can have force field all

that stuff that's inside

fiction becomes reality if you have a

machine that can make gravity and what

we worked on in the desert was a machine

that makes gravity I love your analogy

of dropping off a small nuclear reactor

to the Victorian era I love that that

analogy because back then that was

impossible that was magic but you're

talking about here the fact that they

just discovered this four years ago that

this is a wave but we're as much as we

know and as impressed as we are as we

should be with how much more

technologically advanced we are than

every other creature on this planet

we're still in many ways in the

adolescence of technological innovation

absolutely absolutely

if even adolescence and when you're

talking about this binary star system

Zeta Reticuli and who knows how much

longer these things have been around

than us who knows what their

evolutionary cycles been who knows what

I mean we might be talking about

something that's a million years more

advanced than us yeah yeah it could

easily be now I'm not in believe it or

not I'm not into UFOs I don't follow

stories or you know even after your

experiences no I'm fascinated with the

technology and I it really it works me

like every night I go to sleep that you

know I don't that it was my own doing

essentially that that prevented me from

continuing on in the in the project I

mean it's a that to be on that cutting

edge of technology is so alluring to me

right but you know by the same token I

don't really care that there's aliens or

where they come from I mean the prize is

the technology and that's what I'm

fascinated by but so I don't listen to

UFO stories and that sort of thing but

George Knapp is I mean he's the guy that

has the contacts and tries to thread

everything together and what he recently

told me as he found I don't know is

either documentation or people that he

spoke to it's at this the existence of

this project the project that I was on

it's something that they seemed to take

out every eight or ten years so that's a

very specific memo and

this is actually I this is the first

time I'll be very clear with people

about it it's a big topic of

conversation right now it's called the

Wilson memo you can look it up

Admiral Wilson met with a scientist

who's actually was featured in one of my

films

everybody has been debating whether or

not this document of a conversation with

a with an sitting Admiral at the time is

a real document it's an actual

conversation that happened and this

document is right but he wants to know

the world is going crazy right now in

the UFO world I'll tell you straight up

right now I'm in the position to know

and it is a real document that it is

real so the conversation you read in

that that conversation was had I can't

attest to every you're not being very

clear sure please no problem so there

was a document is circulating right now

that is really big it's going around

everywhere people are asking what is

this document it's called the Wilson

memo is what how you can find it online

though or the Wilson leak there's

Jimmy's got it the Wilson memorandum use

of human vu Admiral Wilson meets with

this scientist and they have this

discussion oddly enough that special

projects at EG&G and if I remember the

document from 2001 I'm telling everybody

right now it's real and we'll see my

history is pretty good would like to say

and if something is real or not right so

here we go the document comes out they

meet at EG&G special projects in 1989

they stumble into a problem this happens

they put the technology away and then

they bring it back out and see if the

material science has caught up and if

they can make any progress so this

document kind of talks about this

process the big thing I get from it and

a lot of its vindicating to Bob and one

of the things that's vindicating besides

the EG&G thing is that private industry

so this guy's an admiral and he says I

found out about your essay P your

special access program I need to know

about it and he's going to a a private

part of Industry and he is denied access

and he says uh you know I should be

running this program and they were able

to deny him access so I think the

takeaway here is

get out I'm telling you that that is an

actual correct that is a leak now

everything said in that document and I

don't know what are you talking about

what what is said in that document it's

it's a between a scientist and an

admiral that are sitting and they're

having a meeting and they're talking

about the the search for the the UFO

subject the search to get special access

program access to all of these different

things like reverse engineering programs

so in this document they talk about it I

believe that the this document that the

person that went was employed by Robert

Bigelow you know one of the guys has a

couple of orbiting satellites and all

that stuff he's a guy owned skinwalker

ranch no he's not he was the guy okay

yeah he used to own it there's a new

owner and I interview him for my other

film but there's a new owner and you'll

be hearing a lot more about that soon

but uh like it'll just there's their

stuff that you'll be hearing about

skinwalker ranch soon because there's a

new owner anyway the whole point of this

in you know insertion here is just that

that document kind of validates a lot of

this idea Bob just said that they make a

little progress then they can't go

anywhere they tuck it away and then they

bring it back out you know ten years

later and start working on it what is

the limiting factor I think Bob should

speak on this but it's the material

science yeah it's really where physics

is so I can I can see them doing that I

mean I didn't have any information on

that but I think what you know Georgia

uncovered is probably accurate that you

know we try and do what we can and once

we reach a roadblock on we really can't

figure it out it's just friggin wait put

the thing away wait for science to catch

up and you know a decade later let's

take the project out again and see all

right now where can we go but there's

got to be someone who remains informed

right oh yeah I've got your scientists

like you and Barry you got you people

that you compartmentalize you've got

these people working there has to be

some people right that know everything

you've got security and then someone's

gonna be on the outside saying hey we

need people to guard this building don't

let anybody in for 10 years I said yeah

I think a lot of that is private

industry and I think that's how they

keep it yeah I think that's how they

litter pick

the government is just so leaky I think

that's kind of what their dough is what

the document kind of proves you just

articulated that that it is in control

private industry what private industry

some aerospace company something I don't

know yeah they wouldn't they would the

guy would the Admiral wouldn't name it

in the car in the conversation yeah so

they still have these things supposedly

I would guess I mean I don't have any

information have you ever asked anyone

that has any inkling of any idea of

where they got them or how they got them

no but something must have been said to

me from Barry and but I Ike it was just

too long ago and I I can't quite

remember it was said but it it just left

a seed in my mind I think at least one

of them was part of an archeological dig

so it's old something one at least one

of them is old I don't know if it was

the one I worked on but I remember

something to do with an archaeological

dig whoa so that's that means it's not

just old it's ancient they'll be a great

Steven Spielberg movie as all of it

would yeah that came out when he said

that for the first time no that's a

freak out right yeah Harrods with some

brushes looking for a Tyrannosaurus Rex

bone hit metal and when did they find it

you know that they have nine of them

well and how could we have not heard

about that what about the guys with the

brushes how could you uncover something

like that and with Joe's newspaper at

home does I mean they said it on that

first day oh you mean the Roswell yeah

yeah I have a cover

what is this is the document but I had

to do some digging to find it yes it's

just kind of yes so this is where they

meet at EG&G and this is Admiral Wilson

and there's a lot more coming out now I

want to be clear George didn't put this

out he didn't leak this out enemy this

is I can tell you how I courted this

this conversation so this was an

employee of at the time Robert Bigelow

and this is in 2002 right you remember

when he had that government contract

called hop the world all knows about now

and he had knids it studied the ranch

that 22 million everybody is saying it

was for a tip advanced aerospace

identification program the 22 million

dollars was for all SAP that was pushed

through through Congress three

congressmen right an astronaut it was

pushed through and that's what that 22

million dollars by the way they spend

more money on viagra every year than

they do studying UFOs if it was just

this program which I think is funny more

money from France they probably do them

UFOs well you never know how it seeds in

a population but anyway this program

this is what was the mother program so

it it got the 22 million and really it

was to study skinwalker ranch oddly

enough that 22 million all was inspired

by the phenomenon they were seen at

skinwalker ranch because the scientists

they're seeing vehicles come through

like a space in the sky yeah we went

there I went yeah you interviewed a

bunch of people that seemed full of [ __ ]

but a couple didn't but this very very

interesting totally and there's a bit in

if you look I spent a lot of time in the

area I'm not talking about those stories

I'm saying there were scientists hired

by the government right through Bigelow

to study the ranch because they thought

it was important and you know whatever

whatever the point is that 22 million

was to study that then we have a tip

which is like an auxilary kind of

program of military settings that

commander flavors and that sort of thing

this document is just one of those

things that has now come forward that

through the Bigelow studies it was

government funded with and then it was

personally funded and then government

funded it's just one of those things

that kind of shakes you because you got

this military guy who can't get access

because of the private industry that's

holding these non-terrestrial materials

that they can't study it so that's the

the claim right now give it some time

let people dig more into this it's

fascinating man so you are essentially

you're you're you're kicked out right

you're you're out of the this program

you can't work with these crafts anymore

and do they give you any threats do they

tell you what you have to do from here

on out yeah well I mean the way it ended

was I told George Knapp all this stuff

and you know he said well let's

just get it on tape should something

happen at least we have a record of it

and I don't remember what the impetus

was but at some point George wanted to

air it and he said you know you make the

call on it and look if at any point you

change your mind

we won't air it and it came down to the

day where George wants to put her on the

five o'clock news he said this is

important stuff people have to know

about it and I thought it was too I said

it's kind of a crime I know you got to

keep the technology secret but you can't

not tell everybody that this stuff is

going on that we have you know actual

hardware from another civilization it's

a big [ __ ] deal you know probably the

biggest one there ever was and George

said you know today's the day we got to

put it on the news or something to that

effect and when it came right down to

the time to air it I changed my mind and

I said we're not doing it and that's

what turned into the famous wrestling

match between me and George trying to

get the tape but he won because he was a

bigger guy so you're actually physically

wrestled well I think it was more of a

pulling match we were I don't think we

ever hit the ground but he got the tape

put it in the player and boom five

o'clock news was on and then I got a

call after that and they said it was

from Dennis he said you have any idea

what we're gonna do to you now and he

hung up the phone that was the last

communication I had with him and what

has happened to you since then after

that a lot of people I've known either

were audited by the IRS people had

anybody I know that had clearances that

worked in secure programs had the

clearances pulled one of them friendly

one of mine that Jeremy knows he's got

on camera with me soon he'll tell the

story now that he's out of work up there

he was working up at the Tonopah test

range waiting for his clearance to come

through and you know they they pulled

that it would it became it's like if

they can't get the person that's

involved they just create a problem for

everybody that surrounds them

and so I mean the way it turns out it

hurt a lot of people's lives that I was

connected to and that's an effective way

of shutting someone up so you feel that

by coming forward and going public that

couldn't just snuff you out that was I

mean that's what I was told and George

and everybody you know said that you

care no it's you know since it's public

there's you know no one will touch you

and I you know I I fell for it and I

wish you didn't yeah sometimes sometimes

when it's just over stress and people

camp it on your lawn yeah but it's this

is gonna make things worse doing this no

does not make things better tell them

how is this gonna make things better

because you're getting a real chance to

explain yourself in a way that's going

to make people who are not only work in

the government people that are police

officers and firefighters and first

responders and doctors and scientists

they're going to emphasize emphasize

empathize and and empathize with what it

must be like to be a person like you in

your 20s who gets thrust into this world

unknowingly and confronted with one of

the most if not the most important

discovery in the history of human beings

the big question are we alone it's the

number one question there's two

questions right what happens when we die

and are we alone those are the two big

questions right and if we're not alone

and someone knows we're not alone and

these some people who know we're not

alone are these bungling sort of even if

they weren't it's a crime yet they're

not telling the rest of us but I mean I

don't mean bungling in terms they're

incompetent

I mean they can't be competent it seems

to me to what you're describing that no

one can be competent with this

technology like the victory Victorian

era scholars analyzing some sort of a

nuclear reactor there's there's no way

why do you think why do you think

they're not telling us let's just make

assumption that this is true right now

why do you think that they're not

telling us that our government doesn't

tell us what's your best well

let me put it in the it would you do if

I'm the president okay and I get this

information what do I do with this what

do I do this there's something that we

don't know there's something we don't

understand there's something that came

from another world we got it tucked away

in the mountains and I just want you

guys to know about it

hey sleep tight hey American Idol is on

tonight who you thinks gonna win yeah

who's gonna win another one is

uncertainty and the other one is what

Bob and I've talked about a lot

absolutely

not knowing what to tell people because

you don't really understand it yourself

even right God what do you say you if

you want to run a government you want to

get people to pay their tax and there's

something else yeah you says you have

these objects fine with impunity right

and yes someone else well not only that

what can you say like how much do you

really know I think it's mainly the tech

knowledge that they just want to keep

the technology secret because there's

yeah whoever gets this yeah you you

control the where you become you

literally become invincible once you

master the technology you can't you

cannot penetrate a field like that so I

imagine that's I know it's all science

fiction but science fiction turns into

science fact if you have real force

fields around aircraft in battleships

you you win you win you can force your

will upon anybody and like I said

there's so much more to the story when I

was first there there were Russian

scientists at s4 that was this was early

on in the project this was before

Operation Paperclip became public as

well right I would imagine that was I

don't know what the dates when was it

when did that was 98 I think yeah yeah I

don't know the dates on roughly ten

years later Operation Paperclip becomes

Freedom of Information Act we say that

Russia and that Germany he's have a

Russian scientists yeah but I mean

Russian scientists a lot of them came

from Germany a lot of those those rocket

scientists that work with NASA they all

came from Nazi scientists got it so some

Russians got some of them I just know at

some point there was intense cooperation

with Raymond even exchanging some ideas

on nuclear weapons and you know EMP

tests and some things we would never

have discussed with them but at the same

time it was in the late 80s they were

involved

actually in the area at s4 with us and

guts communicate with these guys are you

solving no I knew they were there berry

berry would talk about the commies that

were there the counties and that was

back when they were the Commons yes

there were real commies and at some

point it wasn't our group but at some

point there was a big discovery made and

this did not happen when I was there it

happened in between my trips to there

and after that apparently they decided

it was just too cool to share with

anybody and the Russians were never

allowed back on the base after that but

you don't know what that discovery was

no no I said it wasn't my group so one

of the other groups really found out

something but the you know in typical

American fashion is all right this as

our as you guys get the hell out here

was there any inkling that any other

government had something similar

no no nothing that I had her see that

was the thing that always freaked me out

was why if if something was so superior

to human beings it's almost like

visiting an ant colony like why would

you go to the Queen I don't give a [ __ ]

who the queen is I'm a human I'm so

superior to you ants I don't care who

you have running your hive I'm just

gonna study it I think it's who got it

who got it look at the you know rocket

technology in Germany but they got nine

of them yeah that doesn't make sense to

me either so they were either in the

same area or you know one had clues to

where others were I mean I don't know

you you have to fill that in there but

you're right I mean nine of them that's

a that that's a a big dig if it was

archeological well one of the more

recent the recent sightings and these

discussions that have been coming out

recently from Air Force pilots and Navy

pilots they've been talking about things

happening in the ocean and that that

something go literally goes into the

water or something maybe below the

surface think about water 2004 tick-tack

Nimitz case so that's when George Knapp

and I broke on the radio twice before

the New York Times said no this one

really well commander favor and those

pilots there was a disturbance on the

surface of the water

commander flavor visually saw what

looked like similar to

across some object so it's like as if

you have some a coral under the water

and you've got it's breaking over right

the tic-tac is doing this crazy maneuver

that defies it's a gravity propelled

says they saw it in the sky before they

saw in the water right yeah so there

were there were radar that was picking

this these things coming down from

80,000 feet drop into 50 feet in less

than a second this is it this is

actually on the news today there was a

briefing so a lot of people get this

confused I did not this one none either

no so that is called the gimbal so

there's three videos released by the

Pentagon that are all after shoe light

and keep the volume on fire

I would I would really just pay

attention to the source video so you've

got the tic-tac which is this object the

commander flavor saw another pilot

filmed it with a FLIR pod and it goes to

but this one you see is really important

to Bob's story the gimbal craft it's

been recently analyzed it's FLIR not

only does it its definitive that it's

not conventional anything by the by its

movements but there's a pocket of cold

air around a propulsion source so this

object by the way sat stationary for

days if not weeks it's at stationary you

know they found it 11 hours later and

they were saying there's no way this

thing using that kind of energy to go

that fast could just hover the amount of

time and by the way you're seeing a very

small part of what happened that day

this object was not alone and so

hopefully that information comes out and

we can I mean I wish we had video of it

I'm sure we'd all want to see it but

that's called the gimbal that was East

Coast right 2015 West Coast 2004 was the

tick-tack the disturbance on the water

commander flavor believes there was

something under that water that was

causing that disturbance when the

tic-tock was coming around to do in it

with inside the the people that are

studying this they're thinking maybe the

tic-tac system was causing the

disturbance but the USO unidentified

submerged object that he visually saw

the whole interesting thing about that

is I would love Bob to describe it is

why it doesn't matter if these craft are

in space air or water why doesn't it

matter I love when he talks about this

[ __ ]

well first of all commander flavor was

the f-18 pilot off the Nimitz that was

sent out to find out what this stuff is

but and it wasn't just I got a chance to

talk to him recently and it wasn't just

a radar image

I mean commander flavor had eyes on it

for over five minutes watching this

thing as four other pilots did so this

wasn't a radar blip or anything I mean

these guys were watching this thing but

you know one of the things I think in

the gimbal video the way the craft that

we worked on flies is it doesn't fly

like conventional aircraft does and it

doesn't fly like a flying saucer Witter

in a 1950s movie it flies belly-first

I mean it may set down conventionally

but it always rotates it doesn't roll

maneuver puts its belly towards the

target and then moves your car flying

with the wheels forward right right I

mean it may lift it land on the wheels

but at some point when it wants to leave

the flips up points the wheels where it

wants to go and takes off and the gimbal

video you can see the craft do the roll

maneuver and it's really interesting it

behaves exactly like the craft that I

worked on so much like we have different

shaped aircrafts and fighter jets and

cars they probably have different shapes

of these objects that operate under

similar principles right but they all

have the same power source all the same

power source and we're also dealing with

if you think about the laws of

technological progression you know you

think of Moore's law and you think of

how things accelerate you've got to

think that if this civilization is who

knows how many years more advanced than

we are if not even years I mean I mean

we're thinking about in terms of

conventional terms right the way the way

we look at the world I mean they may be

they might be just superior in terms of

their intellect they've gotta be maybe

maybe we don't know well the only reason

I I say that is because look everyone

doesn't necessarily start at

steam engine right and go to an internal

combustion engine and then you know

electric power nuclear power and go up

the ladder that we right can't weigh on

you know the binary if the stuff is true

about the origin and the binary star

system and they have heavier elements

that we don't have and this element

stable element 115 is a naturally

occurring material maybe that's the

first thing they started experimenting

with and the version of their steam

engine their first product was something

that operated like this and actually

when they came to earth to look around

or you know whatever they were amazed at

the stuff we were doing these guys

burned stuff and squirted out the back

to go forward so right um right you know

who says they follow any kind of normal

progression like that

my thought was if you went back to the

1400s and then you went from 1400 to

1500 you're not gonna see that much of a

difference technologically right if you

go from 2,000 to 3,000 I assume there's

going to be a radical change right well

they yeah the Delta the rate of change

is is magnificently higher than it used

to be right so if you think about what

they had in 1988 and you think about

what they probably have in 2019 just

logically seems like they would advance

I would think so the only question is

like are they living is that a living

thing in terms of like a biological

thing or are they some sort of an

artificially created creation like we

are working on right now I mean we're in

the middle of working on artificial

reality artificial being sentient beings

artificial intelligence there's constant

there's silicon-based life forms that

they're essentially trying to create

Boston dinette

was it Boston Dynamics of the company's

robot robots

yeah you can make machines out of flesh

right so a cyborg or cybernetic organism

is just that you know that's what a lot

of people think those like gray things

or you know that people call the greys

you know it's like they were like their

machines rented from flesh so what

you're saying is like just no synthetic

like they don't even need to be you know

machines well they seem to have no sex

organs where they're described by people

that have had interactions

with them assume these people aren't

lying right or crazy or whatever right

that they have no sex organs and that

they don't seem to have any muscle

there's almost like a frame right and

they have enormous heads I mean if you

look at Australia Pittacus or depictions

of you know ancient hominids and then

you go to human beings one of the things

you see is bigger heads and weaker

bodies well you see some clear

progression of evolution you know where

or something like that I would lean

towards synthetic organism because it

looks like it was made for a specific

task there's no reproductive organs so I

mean that almost kind of leaves out any

kind of you know physical evolution

right well that's also the bottleneck

right our bottleneck is our biological

imperative the the need to breed

emotions fear anxiety all these

different things that exist in order to

force us into making sure we reproduce I

mean that's essentially there's a human

reward systems that aren't necessary

once they can figure out a way to make

some sort of sentient artificial life

some sort of thing that doesn't have

these biological limitations that we

have by the way these crafts all these

different kinds have been reported

because it was confusing I always

thought of flying saucers what I heard

Bob Lazar talk about Flying Saucer right

but if you look back in history people

have always reported the weirdest shapes

like none of them are alike you know

there there are other saucers but you

got cigar shaped you got you know the

top hatching you have orbs why maybe

they're serving different purposes

they're doing different things like we'd

use different tools and I want to be

clear the reason I know that memo is is

real is because I spend a lot of time

with dr. Edgar Mitchell a six man to

walk on the moon last guy to film before

he died right that's how I know I don't

want any journalists thinking I got it

from anywhere else I know because of dr.

Mitchell and he said the same thing

maybe these things are performing

different tasks you know and that's what

I seen if you if you think about what an

alien is in terms of our are the sort of

iconic image of an alien like the Steven

Spielberg Close Encounters of the third

time the Third Kind alien they seem like

what we'd assume a human being would

eventually become right and if these

things are tied

human beings are smaller than they've

ever been before the weaker than they've

ever been before and there seems to be a

trend in that direction and this trend

seems to be amplified by our

technological progression there are a

lack of need for muscle strength and our

lack of need for violence and we're

moving in a society to try to get away

from all the things that we think or a

bore and about human beings and the

terrible behaviors that we have if we

one day do give birth to some sort of an

artificial being like Marshall McLuhan's

quote we are the sex organs of the

Machine world you know that one day we

all buy this yeah McLuhan was brilliant

and that that quote has always been one

of my favorites because okay what are we

doing when we were constantly

technologically innovating we're

constantly looking for faster cars

better computers bigger screens faster

more resolution more pixels more this

more that higher bandwidth five G 10 G

right what are we doing we're moving

into this in this if you just follow it

objectively stay stand back

don't attach yourself or your

civilization your culture to it and look

at what it is we're moving a hundred

percent towards technological innovation

if you looked at this species from afar

and if you weren't a part of it you

would say what does this species do oh

they make things they make things better

every year

beehives the same [ __ ] thing that you

see ten years ago you go by see a bee hi

it's amazing it's cool but they're the

same [ __ ] thing they figured out how

to do it they make a beehive right we

don't do that we make better things what

would you constantly and at some point I

think that technology is gonna fuse with

us yes and we're gonna because already

happening yeah Yvan must talked about it

on my podcast that we are cyborgs you

just carry it in your pocket it's a

phone it answers any question you want

you couldn't talk to it it'll give you

the answers into the answers

instantaneously it navigates you it has

all your phone numbers in it has all

your contacts you can get a hold of

people people listening to you through

it

it's connecting us in ways even

involuntarily haptics that kind of yeah

it's also getting on your wrist how many

people have I watches Apple watch is it

all right the rest right and that's only

because we can't integrate them yet but

if you know that point it's kind of

percent yeah I didn't joke about it last

night but I have a bit about it that I

do about the integration between humans

and technology

what would you do if you are a hyper

intelligence right would you do the work

yourself or would you create some cool

things called like humans to do it for

you would you create things that are

cybernetic organisms to come in with

machines and do it for you if you're a

hyper intelligence that has kind of

changed like you've described

you'd probably create workers right well

that's a vast conspiracy theory I'm not

talking about conspiracy but it is a

kind of a conspiracy I'm asking you well

I mean I don't think it's necessarily

that I mean you could look at it that

way but that is the way a conspiracy

theorist would look at it the way I

would look at it is like there's

obviously a progression going on a

biological progression there's some sort

of an integration with technology

there's some sort of imperative this

need for technological innovation it's

inescapable everyone has it and I think

it's attached to materialism and some

sort of a strange way because so many

people work so hard to get new things

and like God that seems so illogical and

preposterous and it makes people unhappy

and depressions on the rise but nobody

seems to be able to stop it like why is

that well maybe it's because we are the

electronic caterpillars that give birth

to the butterfly

maybe that's what we're doing very well

but our job is to do is to make some

sort of a cocoon and we don't even know

we're doing it while we're doing it do

you think a caterpillar as well hey

caterpillar what are you doing man just

doing my thing it's my job I have to

make this could be a natural part of

evolution it could be that right just

supposed to do this and make the jump to

some sort of mechanized right yeah

an orangutan that is fishing with a

spear no they've figured out how to fish

with Spears there's there's some

primatologist without somebody showing

them how to fish no they've imitated

human beings doing it and now they do it

but they do it independently they're not

trained orangutans they're wild rank

believe that there's a wild ratts

impressive well there's these

primatologist I guess you would call

them primatologist that's a term that's

a great biologist biologists that

believe that monkeys and chimps and some

of the great apes are moving into the

Stone Age that they've currently entered

the Stone Age like they're not

staying what they were a hundred

thousand years ago or five hundred

thousand years ago but they're actively

using tools and they're experimenting

with different different ways to use

those tools and then they're making

tools out of stone they're making these

tools out of sticks and they're using

them well this might just be what

happens this might just be what happens

I mean why else why would why the [ __ ]

we work so hard I mean I was I was

driving to LA this morning I had a

doctor's appointment so I was on the 405

at 8:00 in the morning but Jesus Christ

like this is so crazy

when you're in the 405 in LA at 8

o'clock in the morning you see literally

a million cars and it's just everywhere

you go it's people but and also I'm in a

Tesla so I have it on autopilot so I'm

there sitting I'm listening to a podcast

I barely have my hand on the wheel I'm

not touching [ __ ] this cars driving me

along I'm not even doing anything I'm

just I'm just hanging out it's so much

less stress do it that way right so it

encourages you to innovate it encourages

you to embrace this new technology I got

this giant screen it's showing me the

navigation in front of me Oh

be there five minutes early excellent

and I'm listening to a podcast

wirelessly it's Bluetooth screen

streaming from my phone and I pulled

that podcast which came out today out of

the [ __ ] sky and I'm listening to it

and I'm all comfortable in my nice

little car just driving on my way to the

doctor's office this is irresistible

stuff yeah yeah it's frightening ly

irresistible but is it frightening I

mean if you were a monkey or if you were

an Australia Pittacus would you go man I

don't want to [ __ ] be a person I live

in a house that's [ __ ] I like just

swinging around on trees I like running

from Jaguars this is life guys life is

running from crocodiles it's not living

in the [ __ ] suburban oh there's

probably some letter like that yeah I

don't think so I think I think what when

it comes we're gonna embrace it we're

gonna embrace it the same way embrace

cellphones the same way embrace

television there's gonna be a few

holdouts I don't even know an email

address man those although there's a few

and far between there good luck with

that [ __ ] go move to the woods Ted

Kaczynski yeah I was just gonna throw

Ted Kaczynski was right this is

something that I think about sometimes

when I get really

that Ted Kaczynski was a part of the

Harvard LSD studies this has been proven

Ted Kaczynski they cooked his [ __ ]

brain when he was at Harvard and then

when he went over to Berkeley and became

a professor his goal was to make enough

money so that he could to implement this

program and live in the woods and then

write his manifesto and start killing

people that were involved in propagating

technology he was expunged from the

Harvard logs by the way this is

something my friend just called me about

so there's like this private library and

they used to print people's names

whenever they were part of a university

and he was one of the handful of people

that were expunged from it I want to

jump back to the one thing Joe I don't

want to be very careful with that word

conspiracy theorist what I was what I

was saying to you was we terraform our

earth right we tariffs when we change

the environment we do all this

innovation what is stopping us from

thinking that that's not being done I'm

not saying it is I'm saying what's

stopping us from thinking that that's

being done on a much bigger level on a

cosmic level

you mean like aliens coming down doing

that to humans so I'm telling you that

there is something here that's there's a

fact you know there's something there

are craft they're here they're not ours

they're here so the question is what is

that about and I'm just looking at what

we do with what you're describing with

technology I think it's much more likely

that the same way we observe chimps and

we observe that they are now in the

Stone Age that they're observing us and

that they're recognizing that there is a

pattern that there is a there's a steps

that happened I mean Carl Sagan talked

about the different levels of

civilization and then you know if we

don't get past certain levels we're

never going to reach this I mean we're

in civilization gonna stay type zero

well we're in this warring polluting

yeah pillaging were awesome

civilizations

well we're awesome in a lot of ways you

know but in that way we're not well yeah

where were children that have immense

power that we didn't really the other

thing is you're using the immense power

that other people have created right I

mean even when you're driving a car you

stomp it on the gas like whoo you didn't

invent the [ __ ] engine you didn't

invent tires there's all these things

that were involved in the creation of

this thing that is really outside of

your

grasp of understanding but yet you have

the ability to use it like a person with

a gun I'm just gonna bang bang bang

people you don't you didn't invent a gun

so like you've you've without the

intellect to craft and engineer and in

and manifest these creations you just

have access to them because you have

paper or your Bitcoin or whatever the

[ __ ] you're using using a credit card

now you have almost no responsibility

you just you could just flippantly use

these things which is why we you know we

were very childlike in our actions

because we haven't had to earn the

responsibility we haven't had to earn

these things that we've been able to

have and you've only been able to have

them because other people have innovated

and spent ungodly amounts of time and

effort and focus in the lab to create

these things and then they've all put

them together and then what is the

what's the reason to put them together

to profit well what's the reason to

profit well why are you doing this so

you can buy more things well what are we

doing what are we doing we're making

better things that's what we do that's

all that's all we do is make better yeah

why the [ __ ] do we need oil why do we

need oil why can't we just burn wood and

stay home why can't we grow chickens and

food in the backyard why can't we do

what we [ __ ] can we certainly can

people do do it but we decide to make

that almost impossible our preferred way

of living is to stuff everyone into a

very small area where no one grows

anything other than weed this is what la

is la is 20 million people with hard

surfaces ISM is many hard surfaces you

can boy if you got an acre backyard now

a holy [ __ ] look at all that grain this

is amazing no that's the [ __ ] earth

coming through this weird sort of

creation that we've put on top of the

earth but the goal is that like New York

City that's there's none of it right you

just got you've got Central Park and

they just got human [ __ ]

you've stacked up no one's growing

anything and then constant work

everyone's up early go go go innovate

progress make that money so you can buy

more things and every year hey Apple

where's this [ __ ] new phone as if

your phone isn't good around yeah

phone's taking pictures and videos and

people are calling

you when you got applications to tell

you which way the winds blowing it's not

gonna blink of an eye blink of an eye

it's all gone though that you know like

ten thousand years and the Hoover Dam

goes or whatever you know Mount Rushmore

disintegrates so it's amazing because we

have created that and and everything's

trying to spring up through that we keep

it maintenance down but we're we're a

blink man something hits but we don't

think that way well you know you think

in terms of your own life right you

think in terms of what you want and what

you need right now you know what it's we

are in many ways this combination of

this weird primitive ape-like thing with

the ability to calculate and manipulate

our world in our environment that makes

us holy unique on top of that with

existential angst and and and fear so

what do you do with that with [ __ ]

water down with the pre antidepressants

give these [ __ ] people some [ __ ] that

keeps them moving well they're worried

about the future they're trying to

figure out what reality is it's just

you're on a goddamn convertible

spaceship spending a thousand miles an

hour hurling through infinity there's no

meaning to this thing just keep making

[ __ ] keep making stuff and then one day

they're gonna be able to hit that switch

and this life will be born out of

innovation and thinking and progress and

technology and more than likely it's

probably going to be what we're seeing

that these things are that you're you're

observing mm-hmm I'm not observing them

but yeah some ones are you implying that

they're us I don't think they are us but

I think they are what happens when

things keep going it's not us just like

we're not monkeys right all right I'm

not a chimp oh that's a cool like

they're from here is your idea no no no

that this is what happens all over the

union right yeah this is what happened

here's the thing you know I went to see

Brian Cox's he has this amazing live

show with Robin ence where they have

these LED screens he's huge screens with

high resolution depictions of the cosmos

and one of the most mind-blowing things

was he has this large-scale image of the

universe and it shows all the individual

galaxies of the universe and it just

keeps moving through all these galaxies

in three dimensions

and it's [ __ ] incredible but what's

stunning is the relative uniformity of

it even at you know I mean you're

obviously looking at an incredibly small

depiction of something that's immensely

large like a galaxy of hundreds of

billions of stars you're seeing it as

this little dot but this little dot

that's flying through space surrounded

by other little darts with very

similarly spaced distances yeah Himanshu

yeah so Mike if we see uniformity in

that form in terms of like the distance

between cows like so many galaxies is so

it's so similar they might vary slightly

and that slightly might be hundreds of

millions of light years right but but

but there's so much uniformity why would

we not assume that that uniformity

exists pretty much everywhere and that

all these things that you're seeing that

are so similar you do see binary star

systems you do see single star systems

like sorry but there's also some some

speculation that earth and that our

solar system was one time was a binary

star system right I mean that's one of

the the speculations about that that

object that they find outside the Kuiper

belt that the thing is ten times larger

than Earth they think it might have been

at one point in time a star but this

this uniformity that you see why

wouldn't we think that that that has

it's same implications biologically that

there's some sort of a biological

uniformity and that this happens given

the right sets of circumstances yeah you

should be you should tell them some of

the stuff that you've read that you

don't know is true I mean if the the

stuff was true about the propulsion

stuff I mean anyway he well what have

you read what what you saw

- um you know what are you talking about

spill the beans Bob I got to poke the

bear here get some more liquor in yeah

the well I mean the again the the only

thing I could verify was what I had my

hands on they were you know there was

talk of weapon systems that there were

different projects project Galileo

project sidekick was supposed to be

weapon applications of the craft project

Looking Glass had to do with time any

effects of time in the craft now I don't

think we're not talking about making a

time machine like in science

but we're talking about you know small

distortions intentional distortions of

time and how that can be used you know

as a not as a well it was part of a

weapon Pro how are you informed in this

phase again where there's just the small

briefings that I read but again I don't

really like to talk about those because

I don't have any information on him and

it was just you know small briefings he

told commander flavor that what he saw

might have been a time dilation and not

because gravity affects time you know

space time I'm sure you've heard of that

and you know what

what commander Faber saw as he was in

the f-18 approaching it he said it he

described it as a ping-pong ball in a

cup and shaking it back and forth it was

moving that fast now obviously if

there's anything inside there it's gonna

be battered to hell but you know my

point was was that well one of two

things either there's a gravitational

envelope in there which negates any

inertia effects or you are seeing

through a gravity distortion field so

you know just like you're looking at a a

hot Highway and you see you know an

optical distortion going through there

well the same thing happens in gravity

and the craft may not actually be moving

like that it may just look like it

because you're seeing you can only see

it through the field so it may be making

much more gentle moves I'm not saying

that's it but it has to be one of the

two and the thing shows up 60 miles away

they noticed it on radar 60 seconds

after left commander flavor but it was

at his cap point which is the next point

he was destined to go 260 miles away and

in 60 seconds on radar the same object

ends up there so it's going a mile a

second no they I think the radar just

picked it up in 60 seconds yeah it could

have been there instantly but yeah we

don't know the psychics time nobody

knows that's whole thing also its cycles

like radar cycles min doesn't sweep a

planar array so it just you know

scans around it it random place the

spy-1 does the really cool present do

the whole loop anymore right the point

uh the point is though that the craft

moved to his next location before he

knew where his next location was going

to be Jesus and that I mean that's well

documented so that that's a pretty

shocking piece of information what's

fascinating to me too is that you were

discussing this the the way this reactor

worked and that these things were not

really connected no nothing is connected

there's no wiring at all that freaks me

the [ __ ] out charge your iPhone you know

yeah

yeah yeah I mean that's the that's yeah

I know again but that's just simple

electromagnetic induction revenue Tesla

the scientist had this concept of right

yeah yeah that's what I'm talking mean

Franklin on the worse and he wanted to

send wireless electricity through the

sky and Westinghouse was like get the

[ __ ] out of here with that like when

anybody could just pull electricity yeah

this cab meter yeah they couldn't we

just talk in the car right over trying

to chill them out you know we're talking

about Tesla you know you couldn't be

meter didn't how it all that down so

that's funny bring it up yeah that don't

mean who knows what would have happened

in terms of innovation

had he been allowed to go forward with

that well we probably wouldn't have

computers you think yeah I'm pretty

positive well I mean forget about micro

electronics well this is dumping huge

amounts of electromagnetic energy in the

air and yeah we'd be able to wirelessly

turn on our lights but there'd be no

radio communication the interference

would be something we could would be

overwhelming it would induce electric

currents and anything with a small wire

on it so integrated circuits transistors

would be disintegrated before they were

even you know tested for operation so it

would it ways elect us up yeah it would

have stopped us dead we'd have it'd be

great you can turn lighters on and

heaters from all over the place with no

wires but it would stop modern

electronics and this we became dependent

on it

it would almost be like our dependence

on fossil fuels although its destructive

it's very difficult for us to get off

the nipple it would have changed the

course of how he developed which is so

interesting when you talk about it a

civilization of the star system didn't

even start with fossil fuels they had

115 naturally on their planet and

they're like cool anti-gravity is pretty

awesome

well the fact that they I think it's

important that that actually happened

yeah it might have been stopped in its

tracks for a reason whoa and it's just

it's I think it's incredibly difficult

for us to imagine technological

progression under another timeline other

than one that we've experienced yeah

that's difficult if we imagine what this

alien race must have been like and uh I

mean God just just to be able to see

something to like I mean obviously we've

seen it in different life forms right

like we see the life of certain beetles

in comparison to the life of certain

fish very very different existence very

different life cycles octopus yeah

octopus I mean we see all these

different variables in terms of

biological entities on earth but we

don't see it in terms of technological

innovation as we're the only one that's

intelligent that can innovate we we have

intelligent creatures but they're in the

ocean the only other thing that are like

us are dolphins and orcas and whales and

they don't have the ability to

manipulate their environment and

subsequently because they don't have the

ability to emit and manipulate their

environment we put them in fish tanks

and we're like get in the tank do some

tricks right you know the only thing he

saw in the craft if we were considering

Bob's story the only thing that you he

saw in the craft that he related to it

looked like a human could make was this

honeycomb hatch and I always loved that

because you're like obsessed with this

thing that you could recognize a focus

on that because it was the one thing

that I understood how it worked what was

it and it was it was the access to the

level below and it was well you know if

you take yep a six-pack of beer and you

take out the cardboard dividers mm-hmm

set it on the table you can put a lot of

pressure on the top but if you push it

from the sides it collapses flat mmm so

it was something like that in a

honeycomb shape

that was essentially some sort of sheet

metal and you could walk on that an

upper layer but if you took the corner

stuck your finger in and pushed it

collapsed and made a an entryway hmm so

I thought that was a really unique I had

never seen that before and it was the

only thing in the crap that made

absolute sense to me as it ah we can

make that and all that is as a hatchway

was there any discussion about the

materials that were used to make the

craft I'm sure there was but that was a

metallurgy division had nothing to do

with us she never got a not even the

slightest briefing I don't even know if

it was metal or it was ceramic it's I

think it there's a fine line between the

two now one of the things that's

happened to you that has allowed people

to discredit you was there's obviously

been some sort of an effort to erase

your past yeah some sort of an effort to

erase your education history your

employment history at los alamos in fact

the only way your employment history was

proven at los alamos if someone got a

list a directory of the employees from

the past and read into it and you were

on that list so it proved that you

worked there even though people were

trying to deny and they were trying to

use that as a way to discredit you never

did work at los alamos you weren't real

scientists what was what was that like

to experience I mean of course we're

talking about the 1980's the 1990s when

you could get away with something like

that yeah I always say there are a lot

less a lot less records on computers at

that time it was still file cabinets and

folders but yeah that was frightening

that was one of the first things I think

it's I think George Knapp was the first

one that uncovered that I mean he saw my

birth certificate disappear he

disappeared

yeah there was no record of you being

there was there was no record of that

there was money his mom tells me about

that like it was frightening for her for

he's got a real family you know he's

real person is frightening for her but

if the Los Alamos thing really surprised

me and that there was so adamant that

now this guy never worked here don't be

ridiculous and George went back and

forth you know for I got the letters on

the world yeah

once I mean it was ridiculous but

fortunately somebody came up with a 1982

phone book directory I mean and also

originally I told you you know when I

worked there I was on the front page of

the paper so they were still able to

archive you know break bring that back

from the archives and you know Bob Lazar

a physicist working here at Los Alamos

oh there was at least something there

but somehow George came up with the

phone directory and then George then Bob

took George with cameras into Los Alamos

oh yeah yeah so we flew out there and I

said look come on in I'll show you where

I worked we'll go in well meet people

and George went with me and you know no

gate the place oh yeah you know met

people and you know and Los Alamos was

also the place where they had the

machine that was able to read the the

size of your digits no no that was

awesome that was s4 that was s4 and

explain that so now this was back in the

80s and this is back in the 80s where

when you discuss this people like this

doesn't even exist yeah okay what was it

it was a way you know this is before

fingerprint scanners and you know and

anything of anything a high-resolution

scanner at that time so what it was was

a device that had a little picture of a

hand on a glass plate with pins in it so

you could Jam your hand in there and

there was a bright light above it and a

sensor underneath and when you put your

hand in there the light would turn on

and it would measure the bones in your

finger because the light shone through

your bones and apparently the length of

the bones and your fingers are extremely

unique and easy to measure and they use

that when you put your hands on there

the light would turn on and your badge

would pop out there's it oh there it is

that's that's it and I tried to describe

this to people and they said that is the

most ridiculous thing we've ever heard

and I said hey that my badge came out of

that thing I put my hand on it badge

popped out and that's how I could open

the doors and get into s4 and you know

and everybody discredited that they said

it was [ __ ] it was thought of

science fiction and Jeremy you found

that

I found it through a good friend of mine

named Tyler rogue away and he had some

good sources inside of area 52 where

they also used these for the stealth

program right around that time so now

I've got all these people that worked

within who you know said only if you're

in certain programs would we use this

technology it's kind of [ __ ] actually

they didn't keep it for very long

beginning of biometrics so I was able to

reveal it in my film I kept my mouth

shut until I showed it to Bob you know

the movie is the first time he saw it

was how you see in the documentary

that's his genuine reaction getting

goosebumps that was a great idea the way

you did it thank you man because you

know what guess what I'm actually trying

to see if he's telling the truth that's

how I started you know that I started so

it was really cool to see that that you

get to see it his no actual reaction has

that been verified by other people yeah

so yes so to me it has personally I get

emails every day and people are telling

me where these are used and how they're

used and the send me photos I got a lot

of photos by Danny Matteson and how they

were used right they're not how they

were you invite using yeah but I don't

the most recent one was way more recent

than I thought in another country but

yeah that technology was used so what's

so funny is that this technology even in

the area of 52 where they'd use them for

Tonopah one of the guys who will go on

camera when he will do an interview with

me he was a technician for one of these

and and he hated them cuz they were

really bad they always broke down and

never and he was a technician for him

and he won't tell me where if he worked

at area 52 so is probably Tonopah it's

very separated even on base but yeah so

there was that yeah there is your

education record that was also like what

happened with that that well that

disappeared also you know that I I have

I've never gone I've never gone anywhere

for education I've never gone I never

attended any classes at Cal Tech I never

attended anything at MIT you did attend

classes in those places I did attend

classes in those places do you know

anybody that you went to school with yes

I do and have they verified that they

went to school with you well I give

Jeremy some names but people yeah I the

reason I don't say these names publicly

is

every single time I mentioned a name

somebody gets and you don't want to be

yours yeah yeah of course but what what

is that experience like seeing your

birth certificate erased seeing your

employment is frightening it's it's

absolutely fright it's also the fuel

that the debunkers use the so called air

quotes skeptics I don't like the term

skeptics I want to say this probably

because I really only said this

privately I think it's a sloppy lazy way

to look at things to just be a skeptic

let's be objective and I think there's a

lot of things you should be skeptical of

I think you should you should look at

things and look at things from a

hard-line science perspective but the

idea of skeptics the problem with that

is you're always looking for things to

be [ __ ] yeah and I think that's

dangerous because I think some things

aren't [ __ ] it's confirmation bias

on the other end you did is I need to

take a square thing and put it in a

round hole no matter what and I find a

lot of them to be lazy a lot of them to

be lazy thinkers sure because they're

always putting it into that box instead

of going hmm

instead of just separating their ego

they're trying they're playing a game

and the game is calling [ __ ] I want

to call [ __ ] and I'm gonna line up

all these reasons why it's [ __ ] and

I'm gonna ignore anything that might be

contrary to that definition yeah that

does every time I'm thinking I'm gonna

catch him in something you know all

along this process um I found dr.

Crangle he came forward and said I was

in security briefings with Bob Lazar the

physicist at Los Alamos he went on the

record with me now the other people I

talked with well I won't they go on the

record with me because they're still

working there so that that's the

difference right what is that what can

the public have well or even if they're

not working there that you know they

want to live their lives I mean

obviously people have seen what's

happened to you Mike Thigpen after 30

years yeah really

if you look at all the information on

you know concerning my accounts that's

that's verifiable it can't possibly be a

[ __ ] story anymore it's really way

past that point yeah I mean that was my

big pen is I mean how is that he was

assistant lino

so Mike Thigpen was the

that did the security clearances to go

to the bait one of the guys that was a

guy that you work with he said he did

right and and George Knapp you know

George didn't believe him George put him

through four polygraph tests right he

tried to see man this is a big risk it

sounds interesting but let's see if he's

telling the truth one of the things was

Bob said there's a guy named Ike Thigpen

he did security clearances for the base

and that's a weird name it's a very

specific for 30 years George found this

guy in this weird department that he

didn't even know it was my dig pin the

guy wouldn't talk to me ghosts and I'm

totally goes in for 30 years used

Facebook and Google image match through

his children I was able to find him

after 30 years and I talked him three

times on the phone he lives on the East

Coast he almost went on camera with me

confirmed that he did security

clearances for the base in 1989

confirmed he remembers Bob Lazar and

what you don't know is there's a

handwritten note that a friend of yours

has from Mike what I'd um I'll give it

to you later I don't but that is real

that is actual so handwritten oh this is

what you know this isn't it so when the

I when you're when they do security

Clanton clearances they go through all

your friends and yeah yeah so this is to

Bob and I had people come to me for a

friend of mine that's serving and they

were doing a security clearance for him

and even though I'm like the UFO guy

they did you know the FBI come and visit

my house and make sure that they talk

about my friend and they lift a little

card and when my wife told me to get

away because he didn't know who they

were they left a little card it's super

cute now back then it was a handwritten

note and his friend has it for him that

you haven't seen and oh my god two

decades so if you're listening what is

this card it's just a little handwritten

note with Mike Thigpen signature card

like a like a like a postcard like a

piece of paper that he left on the door

saying when Bob gets back or whatever it

says on it so it's just another little

funny thing I found the guy he does the

security clearances he admitted to me he

did it and he admitted to me he was

dodging George Knapp because when George

said his name on the written on the on

the news

he dropped his fork into his steak into

his potatoes or whatever and he's

looking at his wife he was in trouble

his name's never supposed to be out

they're like there's just a security

clearance guy but you don't want

national attention associated with

anything bob has to say but anyway this

unique name Bob said for 30 years and

the guy goes to George Knapp George

could prove he existed he actually

talked to me man he talked to me three

times he almost went on camera with me

it's just crazy what what do you what

happens after 30 years you just get more

info well that's one of the reasons why

when you and me and Jeremy and George

Knapp had that conversation on the phone

yeah I said I think what we can do with

this podcast is important I really do I

think it's important for people to hear

this from you in a very clear just very

concise way and if you examine all the

information that you've said today if

you you look at all the things that the

detractors have said if you look at all

of the new recent evidence that's coming

out and all these really high-level

people in the military and the

government that are discussing this it

gives you far more credibility then you

would have had in the nineteen when this

came out look yes you can't ignore his

don't worry just because you don't like

it anymore that's why I thought it was

important that you come out and refresh

the world's memory and let people know

and like I said I've been and I say I'm

a fan of yours but I guess I'm a fan of

yours as a human being of a fan of yours

but I've been following you for decades

I've been following the story for

decades I mean I'm kidding I have V

Chester Bob like a lot of the world has

yeah it's crazy well anybody that has

any sort of a vested interest or just a

even a just a fascination with UFOs has

followed your story because there's no

one else there's no one else that comes

for this some guy have said I worked

underground with the aliens they shot my

hand off like this a bunch of wacky

dudes underground there's bases they're

shooting lasers through the Earth's

crust and the movement at light speed

there's a lot of those guys they seem

schizophrenic they seem crazy they might

even be disinformation agents they might

be people that are designed to muddy the

waters which force

or has happened Esau was coming forward

there now it's amazing and by doing this

what you're doing you're providing an

opportunity just for Bob to tell his

story you know believe it or not he can

tell his story it's amazing because more

people will come forward now that are

involved with these projects they'll

come forward with you to me they're

coming forward and so what you've done

here is provide that opportunity if they

need it and it's amazing I just want to

say Bob just don't come forward no don't

come forward - Bob why why were you

freaking nauseous at the beginning of

this like so upset why was your why'd

you have a migraine because that started

off so hard my god us in here like did

this why are you asking him why because

obvious anxiety the guy's gone to 30

[ __ ] years of being persecuted his

birth certificate I want to hear him say

I want them by you guys to say that you

did it I stepped out settle down yeah

well I get it your is hard for you to

get him here you know us yeah well what

really annoys me are the people that

sing you know you guys just came up with

the story to make a bunch of money or

get a bunch of you know attention and

that's a good point so please explain

that any money out of this at all and

I'm a I didn't even let you guys buy

plane tickets for me to come out here or

anything I mean any time like when

Jeremy pre previewed I guess the movie

up in Michigan I mean they it brought in

like a couple thousand dollars I made

sure that two thousand dollars went to

science programs at the local high

schools their dirty money I don't want

to touch it I don't take any money from

this stuff and as far as attention I

hate [ __ ] attention I don't like

being on shows I just want to kind of

hide in the corner and do my own thing

so that's I got enough hugs when I was a

kid okay I don't need any attention so

now the if if you if you think somehow

we came up with this thing then you got

to tell me why we did it well you've

done a great job of making sure you have

your bases covered in that regard that

you haven't profited off of this and

like you said that you have donated

whatever money that came your way to

science programs it's I mean it it

doesn't make any sense

any other way I mean what your but I've

got gotten out of here is what I thought

I was going to get out of here when I

watched a documentary that you what

you're saying makes sense it doesn't

make sense that it's [ __ ] that

happened exactly like I said it did Joe

I believe you in closing is there

anything else you'd like to say no I

can't think of anything other than

really don't come and try to visit me

well I know that you have paid a huge

personal cost to get this information

out and I mean maybe you didn't

understand what that cost would have

been when you first initially came

forward with the story but over the past

thirty years it's been immense it's been

great and I just wanna thank you for

that and thank you for all these people

that would not have gotten this

information and would not have really

had this story any other way no thanks

Jim thank you and thank you Jeremy and

one more time the documentary is

available on Netflix right now

yeah it's called bob lazar area 51 and

flying saucers alright that's it folks

good night
