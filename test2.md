hello ben hey how's it going dude we're

here

we did it we did we're both alive first

of all congratulations on your thinness

thanks slender and healthy you look good

oh thank you i appreciate it turns out

running away from my children for

four months straight will do that to you

i literally took up running just to get

away from my

children just going outside just for

some mine space

it's la man you can't get outside unless

you're actively exercising are they

coming to arrest you

oh i could alluded to [ __ ] foot locker

right then they would have that would be

okay do you run with a mask on

no does anybody yell at you no no no

what do you

go to a track like what do you do no i

literally just run around on the streets

hoping that one day i will be hunted

down by the rioters

so i don't have to go deal with my

children screaming at me but yeah that's

that's the that's the goal

did you try to get healthier when covid

hit like were you worried and

a little bit it really wasn't about

covered it was just i was eating out too

much and

when i was relegated to home it was like

i had to learn how to use the barbecue

which i never learned how to use a

barbecue actually

and then it turned out it was actually

not that hard so i don't know what i was

doing for

years i got to give you some elk meat

are you barbecuing right now

oh yeah you're still doing it yeah i'll

give you some elk sausages

you have to do kosher right so i have to

oh that's not cool at all we'll have to

go get the elk and i'll have to actually

like kill it myself

is that what you have to do you'd have

to get the elk and then you'd have to

slice its throat or something like that

oh yeah it's good times

what how that what's the logic behind

that so i mean

not too fast into the biblical stuff but

the the original logic was that you were

supposed to

kill the animal in the most humane way

was the idea now do i know if it's the

most humane way now i have no idea it's

most certainly not okay

because you have to slice it up with the

rabbis man i don't know yeah

i get it how back in the day a very

sharp knife

going through the throat would have been

the most humane way because it's almost

painless

and then the blood just sort of pours

out and that's a wrap right

you don't want the blood anyway because

you're not allowed to eat blood and

judaism so oh really yeah yeah

so what do you do when you have a medium

rare steak i mean you salt the steak

really heavily

that's why this is why kosher meat is

pretty salty so if you go to a steak

house are you allowed to go to a steak

house

uh kosher steakhouse there are kosher

steakhouses ah you're so deep in that

one no man but you're a logical

intelligent guy does part does it every

now and then i like juxtapose those

but does every now and then it [ __ ] with

your head you're like what is this

i mean of course

i don't know there's a religious person

alive i mean who doesn't eventually go

like

okay it's a little weird but all right

you got to embrace the system

but you feel like for tradition and for

just the whole

jewish culture it's worth doing exactly

i mean you

you live the lifestyle and i feel like

it ain't that big a sacrifice to eat at

particular restaurants the restaurants

are still good

they've still got good kosher

restaurants one thing that we're seeing

with society

and culture in general and one thing

that sort of does support the idea of

maintaining these sort of rigid

disciplines is that

when things start to slide just a little

you lose like a

lit these little incremental steps they

slide

and people go oh god what's the big deal

what do you care

and you're like i see where this is

going like i said there's so

this is it's going down that way this is

not gonna stop

it's sliding oh yeah and you saw it in

l.a i mean i've lived in l.a my whole

life

and the the move from la being a

pretty safe fairly nice city suburban

orientation to

just overrun with with horror shows

is really it was a lot faster than i

thought it would be but

it's sort of a you're right it's a

gradual decline and then it's just off a

cliff well you started to see

tents and you didn't see them at all

for decades and then all of a sudden i

started seeing tents i remember

i was doing fear factor in skid row in

the early 2000s we would film down there

and i'd be like this is crazy

like has anybody seen this does anybody

know this because there was these

homeless

streets like you go down these gigantic

and downtown l.a back then for people

don't live in la you would think oh

downtown's like downtown new york or

downtown cleveland

no downtown la was uh no man's land

nothing's going on in downtown l.a

it is now like there's what was

pre-covered

it was like there was some bars and

there was some really cool upscale

apartment buildings it was kind of

picking up

but uh i took my family there before

kovid like

a few four months before covert or so we

went to we we're gonna go to there's a

famous donut place there

so we said just uh one of those goofy

sunday things like what do you guys want

to do today let's go get donuts

so we went to downtown l.a like holy

[ __ ] literally [ __ ]

human [ __ ] on the streets everything

smelled like piss

bums everywhere and i'm like okay stay

close to me stay over here

if anybody comes near you move move

closer to me like jesus christ like this

is crazy i don't want him to be freaked

out but i'm like this is nuts well the

thing is that that sort of disaster area

stuff in l.a was sort of localized right

it really like i worked in the lida's

office for a summer when i was when i

was in law school it's been like 2007

says a while ago

and i remember they had a giant tent

city and you had to walk from

the car they made you park a mile away

and walk it and so you were walking

through skid row

and it's like okay well this this is

really terrible and honestly i feel bad

for these people because i don't think

the best solution for people who are

drug addicted or mentally ill is to live

on the street and a heavy percentage of

people who are homeless are drug

addicted or mentally ill

but you know is it for for people who

are living in the suburbs like this is

at least localized it's not like

reaching into your life

and then over the past 13 years like i

live in a pretty decent suburban area

and i'm seeing like open needles on the

street and walk out of my house one day

there's just a guy lying face down in

the gutter like edgar allan poe

and i thought well this is this is

falling apart rather quickly

what do you think caused the slide or

the

expansion of the slide because i agree

with you that it was very

it was very isolated skid row was very

isolated downtown l.a was very i

remember one time we were filming in

downtown l.a

and we were on a gurney or i guess

that's one of those things called

where it lifts up oh all right anyway

we're filming some fear factor stunt

and as we got up we could see people

smoke and crack

and i go look there's people smoking

crack right there and the the guests

on the show like a lot of them they fly

from all over the country and they're

like is that real

they're really smoking crack going

that's crack that's a homeless person

smoking crack

welcome to l.a it's right there but i

didn't feel bad about it i felt like

look

it's unfortunate but this is not like

indicative of all of la

we're just in a shitty spot because it's

really cheap to film here right here you

go

you know you got a little gift you get

to see some weird [ __ ] while you're here

but

i didn't i didn't think it was ever

going to get to the point where you're

on

like winnetka off the 101 and there's 80

[ __ ] tents and they put a porta potty

there they put a port-a-potty

we're doing real building and real

development here in los angeles

not apartment buildings we got some

porta-potties we put every underpass

shall have a port-a-potty

thanks to mayor eric garcetti you pay

attention to

politics far more than i do and and law

enforcement and all that

what happened how did it get to this

well on this particular problem this

actually started with a bunch of

lawsuits so the lapd used to have the

authority to move people's [ __ ] if it

was on the sidewalk

if people had a bunch of stuff that was

on the sidewalk and they're just camping

out there the lapd could come they could

take their stuff away

and they could rouse them or they could

arrest them for trespass or for

loitering

and then the aclu actually sued and they

said that this is a violation of

people's personal property

oh and the courts tell you you do such

good work sometimes and the court's

ruled that you actually are not allowed

to move people's stuff that that's

actually personal property

even though it's in a public area and

then they got a ruling from a court that

you're allowed to live in your car

because for a while you weren't allowed

to live in your car and then it was

you're allowed to live in your car

so now you're basically allowed to leave

your stuff on the sidewalk and the

police are not allowed to move it

and you're allowed to live in your car

and then

there was this sort of equity movement

that said okay well things do it in

business districts but

why can't they do it in like more

suburban areas why can't they just move

into nicer areas after all if there's

misery it should be equally spread

across the city

and and that's kind of what you're

seeing i mean this is there have been so

many breaking points over the last year

in the city and for me

for me and my wife i mean we looked at

the rioting and they shut down the

entire city at 6 p.m it's a county of 12

million people

and they shut down the entire county so

that douche bags could run around

shattering windows pretending that they

were standing up for social justice

they shut down beverly hills at then

rodeo drive 1pm

1pm so that people could run up and down

rodeo drive talking about how capitalism

sucks while

tweeting from their iphone while

stealing stealing nikes

you know there was two moments where i

was like this is a real opportunity for

us to come together and one of them was

the moment the lockdown happened

it it felt to me very similar to right

after 9 11 where everybody was

confronted with their own mortality

like holy [ __ ] like we we

might be on the verge of a pandemic like

in a movie

where a lot of the people we know die

and here

we we have to be kind to each other we

have to be this is what's important

family is important

and i remember thinking i've never been

closer to my family

never been closer to my friends we're

calling each other all the time we were

it was like it was a there was there was

real hope in that i was like if

we get through this we're going to be

tighter we're going to know what means

something what counts

[ __ ] stand up comedy [ __ ] everything

else man

what's important is love and friendship

then it started to get angry

it only took like three or four weeks

where people started getting

like they were scared so people started

getting shittier with each other online

and then i basically swore off twitter i

was like this is just too

toxic and too hostile the second moment

where i thought we had the opportunity

to come together was george floyd

so george floyd died and all of a sudden

you have these black lives pro matter

protests and and i'm like

maybe we can finally make a dent on

racism maybe we can finally make a dent

in police brutality maybe this is a

moment where we can come together

and realize what's important is

community solidarity that

we we we're all in this together like

this is crazy and then the cops need to

be reformed like they can't live like

and maybe we should take into into

account ptsd maybe we should take into

account the fact that these [ __ ] guys

are

pulling up on people every day that

might shoot them in the face they might

never be able to see their family and

their kids

let's rework this let's think this [ __ ]

through

nope then chaos and then all of a sudden

it became like

what we saw yesterday where they're

breaking into amazon

go in seattle like that [ __ ] guy

owns the washington post he owns the

most

left-wing newspaper in america and

you're like not good enough well you saw

they set up a

like a fake guillotine outside of

beethoven's house in washington dc it's

insane and

it's it's just it's madness i'm too rich

i totally agree with you by the way like

when

when the when covet happened i thought i

can't really see how we're going to

split in partisan fashion over this

thing right like

everybody wants to live and everybody

would also like to eventually get back

to regular life

and the better we can live the better we

can get back to regular life so it seems

like

okay we're on board when it came to the

lockdowns the original lockdowns i was

like okay i'm on board you know i'm

taking this thing really seriously i've

got parents in there in their 60s i feel

like

you know i'm in good health i'm fairly

young i'm 36

but for my parents i don't want my

parents getting this thing and so we're

still taking this thing real seriously i

mean i'm still wearing a mask around to

public places and i think people should

i think that's a responsible thing to do

but it immediately turned into who can

we blame for this who can we blame

who's doing it wrong and it seems like

there are only like a couple

of things that you really can do that

are obviously wrong like nobody has a

good solution on this thing okay it

ravaged

italy it ravaged spain it ravaged new

york like

there are a couple things you shouldn't

do don't take the olds and send them

back into the nursing homes with coveted

right

that's like an obvious one but beyond

that like just staying away from each

other

and socially distancing and worrying

like this is all kind of common sensical

stuff that

people have known since the flu pandemic

event 1918 like nothing nothing has

really changed

and yet it immediately turned into who

can we blame who's who's to blame for

all these dead people maybe it's ron

desantis or maybe it's cuomo like who

who can we blame so that was terrible

and then on the floyd stuff

i had the same feelings like i don't

know a single human being who watched

that tape and didn't think okay that guy

deserves to go to jail

chalvin right the officer in that case

and the george foreign everyone and

everybody

every single person was like yeah that's

that's real bad like that's and

cops like i know tons of cops i'm

friendly with tons of cops and not one

of them was like yeah that's good police

procedure i'm glad he did that like no

one thought that

and so when people like okay we're gonna

look at police brutality maybe we'll

take a look at qualified immunity

maybe we'll take a look at police unions

and the kind of restrictive covenants

that they have with the cities and

and how we make sure that everybody

knows who the bad cops are so they can't

get hired at different places

like all those are solutions but they

quickly turn from well we don't want to

talk about solutions solutions are a bad

idea what we need to do

is we need to shout about everything we

can possibly imagine

all at once and you know what instead

let's have a conversation about like

was george washington a bad guy let's

have a conversation instead

about like just completely defunding the

police we don't have like a responsible

conversation

about things that make sense we'll talk

about like what if we just got rid of

the police

how crazy is that discussion that

discussion uh

when when people were really saying

defund the police i'm like cooler heads

will prevail

but they're going to realize and i think

they're realizing it now in new york

city

i mean new york city has had record

crime record homicides

who would have thought who would have

thought de blasio is

i mean i would have never i would have

never imagined

i would look at garcetti and go well

he's better

that's exactly right

i look at garcetti and i look at de

plasio i'm like garcetti i'll have him

over my house for dinner he's way better

so weird he's so you can have protests

but only black lives matter protests

that one that was that was a solid you

know that was that may have been the

moment when i realized that we were all

effed

right it was the moment when like we're

in the middle of a global pandemic

with hundreds of thousands of people

dead and an entire swath

of our media and health elites just

decided randomly

that if you were protesting against

lockdown you were very bad right then

you were a racist and you're going to

get people killed and you should wear a

mask and i was like well if you're pro

i sort of agree with the mask thing like

yeah okay and then

you get millions of people in the

streets yelling at each other and

breathing on each other and spitting on

each other

and you got health professionals on tv

being like well racism is a public

health threat i guess that you can do

that now it's like

what the i know people who died in the

hospital of covet and their family could

not visit them

like they literally died alone in the

hospital of covet and family could not

visit them and you're telling me

that it's deeply important that we have

like dance lines this was stuff

happening at rallies like dance lines in

the streets in new york to fight racism

that's deeply important but a daughter

being able to visit her dad before he

dies that's not important

i am but what [ __ ] i am for your

freedom to protest i'm 100

for your freedom to protest i'm also for

your freedom to go to the gym

i'm also for your freedom to go to a

comedy club if you so choose

um for your freedom to go to a

restaurant look they figured out how to

do restaurants in a lot of places the

the servers wear masks

and many of them wear face shields you

distance the tables apart from each

other you do temperature checks you take

people's names and addresses down

when they enter so that if anybody gets

sick if there's any sort of kind

and they've been able to do this no this

is right the vectors of transmission are

typically

closed areas people in solid proximity

with each other for long periods of time

yes right that that's the stuff where

people are getting this stuff and

i i i trust most americans not like some

americans would be dumb asses some

people are just dumbasses oh there's a

lot of videos

oh yes you watch youtube there's plenty

of karen's out there how sad is it if

your name is karen and you're a good

person

all the good karen's out there i'm sorry

ladies

i'm really sorry but it's like this is

i made this point online i got

shellacked for it but i was pointing out

that

most americans are wearing masks right

now bipolar data 59 of americans say

that they always wear a mask when they

leave the house

and if you look at the map of mask

wearing across the board in the places

where

there are the most cases people are

wearing masks that's not i wasn't saying

masks don't work i wear a mask i think

that

the evidence shows that they do

something and we don't know that they're

not like full protective they're

the cloth masks are not as effective as

surgical masks which are not as

effective as m95s but

wear a mask good the point that i was

making is people are acting

in fairly rational fashion meaning if

you think kovit is like around you

you're wearing a mask and you're

socially distancing so this this idea

that

gavin newsom knows best how you ought to

live your life

like i i got some trouble with that

especially because california saw the

same uptick as texas and florida and

california never opened i mean we've

been here the whole time california

never really opened well we were doing

pretty good

up until the protests yes everything

seemed like it was on an uptick the

comedy store was talking to them about

becoming an essential business and and

opening up because

they had opened up bars and they had

opened up restaurants

and they didn't really have a

designation for comedy clubs they they

sort of talked about it as a live

performance venue but then

that puts comedy clubs at the same place

as the staples center

which sounds crazy right right so like

listen we can do this we can just have

half capacity

temperature checks do it right they're

doing it right in a lot of places all

over the country

we can do this the audience has to wear

masks this is totally doable

and so they were right about to do that

and then post

this other thing is we were trying to

figure out like is it protest only i

think it's bars too

yeah the thing about bars is close talk

people are

talking yeah they're drunk and they're

on top of each other i think bars

probably have a church significant

update

lots of singing lots of lots of

vocalizing right churches and synagogues

were a main vector for this

yeah i mean but again these are all

things that are fairly common sensical

and we can agree on and yet we're

beating the hell out of each other

over this stuff and there's the

suggestion we know what to do if only we

just did it this would stop it's not

gonna stop

okay it's not gonna stop it's a very

transmissible disease we don't have a

vaccine as long as people are out there

it's going to continue to pass wear mask

if you're in close proximity with others

and that's

pretty much it the hospitals are getting

better at this thank god yes they are

and the crazy thing was that they were

saying

like the you can only protest if it's a

black lives matter protest

what about a protest for increasing your

immunity

what about a protest for educating

people to

the the the techniques and the

strategies for increasing your immune

system

it is there are they're out there and

there's no discussion about this amongst

health professionals

excuse me amongst politicians if you

listen to health professionals

people that really understand the human

body they'll tell you there's a lot of

strategies there's a lot of things you

could do first of all eliminate

alcohol eliminate caffeine eliminate

sugar

eliminate all the [ __ ] in your diet

start taking vitamin supplements get

outside get some vitamin d

get get your body healthy exercise do do

all these things

and you will increase your immune system

you increase your body's health

you don't hear a word of that all of it

is just stay inside

lock you know we have to stay apart to

keep everybody safe and

god damn the number one vector for

transmission remains the home

right that's still the number one vector

in every society is the home people

going home and giving it to each other

and

when they i remember for for me one of

the breaking points in la was

was when they decided they were going to

shut down all open

areas they're going to shut down all the

parks they're going to shut down all the

beaches and i was like what is this well

not only that it goes against science

because

there's been papers that have been

studied that show that this virus dies

almost instantaneously when it's exposed

to sunlight or even artificial sunlight

yeah none of it makes any sense but it

does feel like bottom line there were a

bunch of gaps in american society

and then a bad thing happened and all

everything just sort of fell apart it

was sort of like a house of cards and

then

there's a little bit of weight put right

on top of the house of cards and

everything just collapsed in on itself

well people are panicking you know

they're getting scared and then the

economy's collapsing

so the economy collapsing at the same

time as the george floyd protests

led people to start looting and then

people that didn't give a

[ __ ] about george floyd or black lives

matter were just stealing [ __ ]

and then this police was letting them

steal [ __ ] they were standing down in

beverly hills and santa monica literally

cops standing there while people are

saying i gotta say the media coverage of

this stuff is just awful

the media were cheering this stuff on

and they were simultaneously making two

arguments that conflict with each other

one was these are mostly peaceful

protests first of all mostly peaceful is

the most

it's it's the loosest most loosely

defined arbitrarily applied term in

history

simpson was mostly peaceful that night

oj simpson was mostly peaceful that

night for like an hour 15 he was really

not peaceful but for the other

hours between sunset and sunrise he was

unbelievably peaceful like i've never

heard this term before where

a protest turns into a vast riot you

know wrecking all of melrose

and everybody's like well it was mostly

peaceful what what is that

what is that true so how about this how

about you either say

that the protesters and looters are two

different groups of people and we treat

them differently if you're protesting

that's first amendment activity the

minute you shatter a store window you go

to jail

right that's the way they should run or

alternatively

if it's if you're saying they're the

same group then they need to be treated

as law breakers so

i i believe the first i believe you're a

protester you should be protesting if

you're a looter and a rioter

then you should go to jail but the media

refused to make that distinction and

then they act like the cops are the bad

guys when they come in to to arrest

people

who are violating the laws i think it's

in portland right now they're trying to

burn down the damn courthouse yeah and

the and the feds come in and start

arresting people and people like this is

the gestapo it's like

okay speaking as one of the tribe let me

say this is not like the gestapo

okay like the gestapo was not famous for

rolling up on people and then

charging them and then if they didn't

have a charge releasing them that wasn't

like the gestapo's thing

i'm sorry but you decided that you want

to throw a fire bomb at the federal

courthouse

and your local mayor said he wasn't

going to let the police do anything and

so dhs came in and arrested you

tough [ __ ] i mean like i'm sorry that's

at some point somebody's got to restore

some semblance of law and order here

well it's it's a weird situation because

i don't

exactly understand why they're attacking

the courthouse

i don't exactly understand why they're

smashing the windows at amazon go

it's it's steve martin right they think

they must hate these paint cans

really from the jerk right but it's

it's it went from this to

literally tear down the structure of

society

well this is where we get into sort of

the deep philosophy point and this is

this is actually really

the the biggest problem right now on the

racism point is the shifting definition

of racism

so i had the unfortunate experience of

actually reading one of the best-selling

books in the country robin d'angelo's

white fragility

and let me just tell you a greater pile

of horseshit has never been produced by

a bevy of horses

it is an awful book and it is basically

rooted in the same theory as ibrahim

kendy's how to be an anti-racist

the the basic definition of racism

changes in this theory so racism

you and i were sitting here discussing

racism and the way i define racism is

probably the same way you define racism

you believe in the inferiority or

superiority of a group based on race of

an individual based on their membership

in that group too right that would be

racism

i believe that you're inferior or you're

superior based on your race end of story

right that's that's racist

so robin d'angelo and ibram kendi

redefine racism to mean

any societal structure that results

in a racial inequality is itself racist

so any structure

that results in a not exact proportion

between whites and blacks does that make

the nba racist

exactly exactly the answer is kind of

yes except that

the nba is not racist because obviously

it benefits black people right i mean

now

the nba is not racist in except it's

because it's meritocracy it's the reason

the nba is not racist

but robin d'angelo and kendy both

suggest that meritocracy is an aspect of

whiteness

they say that meritocracy and individual

are aspects of whiteness because

these institutions things like

meritocracy and individualism

and not seeing people's colors these

just reinforce hierarchies that end

with disparate outcomes and so what they

say is in order to be anti-racist

you have to want to tear down the entire

system they literally say this i'm not

i'm not

really i know that i'm not

misidentifying the argument because

again i've read their books the the

basic notion

that to be anti-racist you have to tear

down free markets

or you have to tear down free speech or

you have to and what that means is of

course

that any time there's rioting and

looting that's really just an expression

of outrage at the broader american

system

and so it justifies that sort of stuff

this is why you saw nicole hannah jones

the de facto editor of the

new york times 1619 project lady

tweeting out that she appreciated the

people were calling these the 16 19

riots

because once you say america is rooted

in slavery and rooted in evil in a

terrible horrible no good very bad place

then robbing a shop is just the latest

iteration of you fighting the system

explain the 1619 correlation to people

if you would sure so the 1619 project is

is something put forward by the new york

it's not good history there are four

pulitzer prize-winning historians who

said this is not good history

the basic argument is the united states

was not founded in 1776 with the

principles of the declaration of

independence

the count the country was actually

founded in 1619 with the importation of

african slaves to american shores

because that's when the first african

slave arrived in the united states was

1619.

so the idea is that the entire history

of america

is a history of a system that is

endemically white supremacist

and that all of the declaration of

independence is basically a lie that the

principles of all men are created equal

that was a lie when it was written and

it's a lie now

that the idea that we have rights that

pre-exist government that's a lie

all of these things are lies the

constitution was built in order to

enshrine white supremacy

and no evolution has taken place so they

they essentially make the argument

that from 1619 to 2020 is a continuum

racism has gone underground a little bit

but it's still there and it's still

it's still implicit in all of our

systems so the 1619 project has essays

blaming

literally everything on racism so

disparities in maternal mortality

between black women and white women

which by the way exist in europe and in

canada

that's due to american racism traffic

patterns in the united states

is due to systematic american racism

every racial disparity

is attributable to a system that was

rooted in slavery

now the traditional notion of america

that america was founded in 1776

and that the story of america is that

america did tolerate

the great original sin of slavery up

until the civil war and then

tolerated jim crow up until the civil

rights movement of the 1960s and that is

a great stain and a blood on america but

the story of america is trying to

fulfill the promises of the declaration

of independence over time make those

promises available to everybody

and this isn't my argument this is

martin luther king jr's argument when he

talks on

in the march in washington about

fulfilling the promissory note of the

declaration of independence he says

we're here to cash the check right you

issued us the check and then you didn't

let black americans be americans

we're here to cash the check is the

argument frederick douglass the freed

slave makes in 1852

makes a famous speech before slavery is

ended he says july 4th doesn't mean

anything to black americans

because we're not included in the

bargain include us in the bargain

the story of america is the declaration

of independence those principles that we

should all basically

still agree on because they're pretty

good principles free speech

free assembly all the things you see in

the constitution

that those things brought about greater

freedom and prosperity than anything

else and helped us overcome

the sins that are present in all human

societies and were present in the united

states in extreme ways as well

but that's that's the counter-narrative

right the 16-19 project says

that all that was basically nonsense and

that america's just a history of

whites keeping blacks down and that no

progress has essentially been made if

there is progress it's mostly a lie

and so every disparity now can be

attributed to historic disparities

between white and black

is there middle ground d so

if we look at 1776 and we look at the

declaration of independence and we look

at america today in 2020

there clearly is some impact

in the echoes of slavery and then after

that jim crow there's clearly

some impact in these deeply impoverished

communities that don't seem to advance

yes so the to to make the argument about

institutional racism

there's a couple ways you can read this

when people say systemic racism or

institutional racism

i usually ask them to be a little more

specific in what they mean because there

are a few ways you can read that one is

history has impact of course that's true

right that's true for everybody

it's true in your family history if you

have a grandfather who

went to who went to prison on a

particular charge that leads to poverty

for your parents which led to more

poverty for you right

people have histories those histories

are embedded in their life experiences

and that's true for societies as well

all of that is for sure true

then there's the question as to whether

the institutions today are racist

and that's not quite the same thing

right because history has consequences

is not the same thing as saying the

rules today are racist

because the rules today are not racist

actually the rules today are quite not

racist

so but historically it's fairly recent

if you go from the civil rights movement

to 2020 we're really not talking about

that much time

it's about three generations 50 plus

years 60 years yeah

i mean it's 50 plus right in the world

of you know

in the best span of human history it's

not a very small amount of time right

so clearly there's some impact of both

racism

and then jim crow laws so that that's

where i'm saying there's a middle ground

yeah

and it's independent it is important for

people on my side of the conservatives

to

acknowledge and recognize the importance

of of history in people's living

situations now

and it's important for people on the

other side of the aisle to at the same

time not attribute every single thing

to history because right but people who

are bullies something like that

there's always like extremes on each

position

and the truth lies somewhere in the

middle yeah but i don't think that it

lies as far

in in the dead center of that as people

i think want it to

what i mean by that is the problems that

have plagued communities in the united

states not just the black community in

the united states but problems of racism

or problems of sexism

the way those get alleviated is people

making better choices over time

right that is the problem that's the way

that those issues get alleviated when

jews arrived in the united states in the

in the early 20th century to talk of my

people

when they when they came they were

impoverished they didn't speak the

language

they were banned from country clubs

there was open discrimination against

them they were banned from harvard right

harvard law school had quotas on jews

the the way to fight against that is to

make

good decisions and so the you fight

against the system to make sure that the

system has

rules that apply equally to everyone

right but you clearly see that there's a

big difference between people coming

over here willingly

and doing so in order to better their

lives versus someone

whose ancestors were dragged over here

to be sold as property

and then dealing with the repercussions

of that being your family history

and redline laws and all the other

things that were put in place to sort of

keep them in very specific areas which

to this day remain crime-ridden

gang-ridden

deeply impoverished communities well

that's true but the question is how much

of that is historic redlining and how

much of that is an 18 year old kid today

deciding to pipe a gun and shoot

somebody but how much of that 18 year

old kid today

deciding to pick up a gun and shoot

somebody is based on him

growing up in this [ __ ] up environment

where that's what he models where

everything around him is crime

and gangs and you imitate your

atmosphere which what all humans do

right but the answer is there's only one

way to break that chain what what way is

that

that way is to not pick up a gun and

shoot somebody i think that's a

simplistic

way of looking at it if you're on the

outside of that community and you're not

one of those 18 year old kids that grows

up

with the incredible influence of all the

people around him and that's all you see

and that's all you know well but the

problem is the only way that's going to

be

the thing that your kid doesn't know is

for you not to do it at some point

personal agency has to come in some

it does because the expectation

education and and teaching them

about personal agency and and letting

them

understand that there's a way out of

this and that the path that they see

being replicated over and over again by

these people that wind up dying young

that wind up going to jail

that there are other options there's a

lot of kids that never get that other

information or if they get it

they get little blips of it but the vast

majority of the information the vast

majority of the influence they get is

terrible well

i totally agree with this and this is

why i think the worst thing that you can

say to a kid

is you're born behind the eight ball and

no matter what you do you're not gonna

succeed

right that's literally the worst thing

you can say to a kid what you should be

saying is look at how your grandfather

was born behind the eightfall and look

how hard he had to work

in order to get ahead and look at all

the options that's true though but if

your grandfather

wasn't ahead didn't get ahead if your

grandfather

was in and out of jail if your father

was in and out of jail everyone around

you is like that

if there's literally no influence that's

positive in your life

the idea of saying to a kid like that

hey don't pick up a gun and shoot

somebody

it's way that's way too simplistic a

version

of of their future in my mind i mean the

problem is i don't see an alternative

solution

i think an alternative solution is there

has to be some sort of

large-scale intervention in these

communities to do something

about what what what has already been

set in motion and the momentum that

keeps continuing decade after decade

i don't know what could be done well but

that's the problem is that i think that

a lot of the solutions that have been

proposed have already been tried meaning

okay so for example lbj thought that the

way to alleviate a lot of these

inequalities was the war on poverty

and he openly talked about this he

talked about he gave a speech very

famously in which he said we're trying

to guarantee equality

of outcome not just equality of

opportunity equality of outcome

and you can't hold the race where

somebody is starting 20 yards behind

and then fire the gun and say okay

that's an equal race right so you have

to get the person who's 20 yards behind

to actually get up to the starting lines

that they're equal

and so the idea was we're going to fight

this war in poverty and alleviate

poverty

largely through transfer payments and

and through the government taking a

forcible step

in favor of alleviating people's lives

we've now spent 22 trillion dollars in

the war on poverty

and we have about the same number of

black americans living under the poverty

line as we're living under the poverty

line

by the late 70s the the the real issues

that that are inter

that are creating intergenerational

poverty everyone knows this but remains

true

the number one predictor of

intergenerational poverty in the united

states remains single motherhood

the single motherhood rate in the black

community was 20 in 1960 it is upward of

70

today that's not unique to the black

community by the way it's true in the

white community as well the five five

percent

of white kids were born out of wedlock

in 1960 today is upward of 40 percent

that is not something has happened and

it is not

a matter of increased racism that's not

happening because of increased racism

right that is happening because there's

been a

cultural change that does not place

tremendous emphasis for black or white

or for anybody

on personal responsibility and personal

agency there needs to be a mindset

change

we do this by the way in all other areas

of american life except for

the most important decisions in the area

of sports nobody does this routine

and there is a point shelby steele makes

in the area of sports if a kid is not

does not have a good jump shot nobody

says to him you know what you don't have

a good jump shot because your father

didn't have a good jump shot his

grandfather didn't have a good jump shot

and the game is

biased against you we say okay if you

want to be on the team you're going to

have to learn to shoot a jump shot

right that that sounds harsh that sounds

bad but sports are different

and here's why sports are different

because sports you enter them

independently of your culture

you you you base what you're trying to

do

on the parameters of the rules and the

people that you're competing against

that's how you look at it so you

whatever culture you're from

you you walk into this new thing with

this very rigid set of rules

i don't think white people are good or

asians have a monopoly on valuing

education or monopoly on hard work or

punctuality or anything i think that

black people

have exactly the the same capacity as

any

people of any other race to do all of

these things and those are the

preconditions for success you either

meet them or you don't i mean

that's true for everybody but don't for

success but don't you think

that a lot of that is predicated on the

environment that you develop in

and the people that you're around and

the lives that you imitate

and the influences that you have around

you someone has to do something to

influence those kids in a different way

look i was very fortunate when i was

young that i discovered martial arts and

it

kept me from being what i could have

potentially been

a bad kid like it gave me something to

focus on

there's and i didn't grow up in a bad

environment but it wasn't the best

there's a lot of people out there that

grow up in horrific environments and

they never

have that thing they never have

something they they don't have a father

around

or they don't have a mother around or

whatever whatever bad

influences they have are overwhelming

and they

they don't it's it's very difficult

for someone to just air quotes get their

[ __ ] together it's very difficult for

sure that's why

to this day there's so many books about

losing weight

don't you think everybody wants to lose

weight that's fat they do they everybody

who's fat wants to be thin

they do but it's [ __ ] hard for sure

and that's nothing

in comparison to changing your whole

life but but you would say about

somebody losing weight you know what's

not useful here is lamenting

how bad your family has had it with

regard to losing weight like at a

certain point if you want to lose the

weight you got to figure out a way to

lose the weight that's true

this is based on the information that i

have i have this vast

scope of information that i've been able

to absorb if you're in these isolated

environments and

everyone around you is involved in gangs

and crime and drugs

it's very difficult to model yourself

after something that you don't see in

real life

so totally true totally true and that's

why again more information needs to get

into areas

i agree with a lot of the opportunities

that need to be provided by

education getting people to be educated

outside their local public school would

be a good change i mean being able to

like move outside your crap local public

schools

would be good the best influences for

kids that grow up in these environments

seem to be

people that have gotten out and then

come back and talk to them

right and tell them how to do it but

none of this can be done but to go back

to the original conversation none of

this has to do

with telling kids that you live in an

evil country that's seeking to keep you

down

well maybe not but there there has been

a very small amount of emphasis placed

on

taking these impoverished communities

and figure out how to engineer them out

of this situation

that's true so i don't think that's true

yeah i mean the amount that we've spent

on a federal level and a state level

on educational programs and poverty

programs over time

but on a year-to-year level i mean these

are these are enormous quantities of

money this is not a mon

this is not really a money problem it

really is not a money problem in just

terms of

you could sign everybody a check

tomorrow right the predicate so the the

predicate for the

slavery reparations movement is exactly

this sign everybody a 80 thousand dollar

check

and the problem will be alleviated no it

won't i don't think that's i don't think

i think they'll spend 80 000 and they'll

be right back where they started from

but i do think that there is

an argument that there can be some way

of engineering whether it's community

centers or education or doing something

differently in these places

to chip away at this problem so on that

stuff we totally agree

the only point that i'm making about the

16 19 project is when you teach people

that they are the victims of a society

it makes it very difficult for them to

succeed the story of black america

should be a story

of unbelievably brave people triumphing

over systems that sucked

right i mean that that is the story of

black america most black americans do

not live under the poverty line in the

united states

there's a huge black middle class

there's a black upper class yes there is

let's

let's simplify this if we can sure if

ben shapiro is the king of the world

how do you fix baltimore how do you fix

detroit how do you fix

the south side of chicago okay so here's

the unpopular view but it happens to be

empirically correct the first thing you

have to do is you have to load the place

of the police

you got to load the place of the police

because you have to stop crime once you

stop crime

then businesses are happy to invest in

those areas you're not going to get

businesses to invest in those areas and

provide jobs unless the crime is gone

you need in fact one of the reasons that

you have such a vast differential in

racial crime in the united states is

because of white racism

and there's a point that jane levy

writer for the la times has made and she

writes a book called ghetto side and she

points out

that the reason that black crime was so

high in the early 20th century and late

19th century

is because basically white communities

said to black communities you're on your

own

right enjoy and so the crime rates ended

up spiking because there were no police

there

you have to make sure that law abiding

people are protected that law abiding

businesses are protected that people

want to live there that people want to

invest there

you have to have a re-establishment of

faith in churches right you need social

institutions outside of government that

are promoting things

like family you need you need more one

of the reasons you need more companies

in these areas

is they can offer educational

opportunities to kids internships

deals to go to college and then come

back and work for us for a couple of

years

right you need opportunity the same way

that opportunity is built anywhere else

on earth you need to

provide a safe space for business to

work and for free speech to flourish

and for education to be valued you need

to go in you need to make clear to every

kid

if you graduate high school then you

will have a shot at college which by the

way is

100 true today if you are a black kid

and you graduate high school with any

level of achievement

you will have a very solid shot of at

least going to a community college and

if you score per

even decently on the sats of going to a

very high level college right

affirmative action programs are

extraordinarily common

across the united states but the the

first message is

we are going to ensure that law and

order prevail here a safe space for life

liberty and property

and ownership of private property and we

are going to make sure that you as a law

abiding citizen have the opportunity to

succeed because

the biggest obstacle to young black kids

growing up in the inner city again

is not history it is in the moment the

drugs the crime

the fact that there are no fathers in a

lot of these areas roland fryer black

professor at harvard he's done excellent

work

showing that actually the number one

factor in allowing

kids to to rise is not even having a

father in the home it's how many fathers

there are generally in a community

so you can you can have a single mom but

if there are a lot of other male

father figures around that helps fill in

the gap right these are practical things

giving kids the ability to pick the

school they go to so they don't have to

go to the local crappy public school if

it's a local crappy public school

it would be a solution here but this all

starts with the notion that

it is not racist in the slightest to

suggest that law and order have to

prevail

and that law-abiding people should be

protected in their exercise of their

rights

i think you're 100 right on that and i

think although that might be

an unpopular opinion i agree with you i

think that is very important

now what do you do in this environment

when you look at the way people distrust

the police now

in particular i mean i mean i've been

reading stories about

cops going to five guys burgers and they

can't get served because people won't

serve cops

and this idea that all cops are bad and

this is a

very really disturbing perspective to me

because

you're seeing what's happening right now

in chicago you're seeing what's

happening right now in new york where

you have this massive uptick

in violent crime because it's perceived

that the police presence has been

diminished greatly so how do

you reaffirm the trust

in in in law enforcement and what do you

do to reform law enforcement because

clearly

there are some people that are cops that

should not be cops yes there are a few

things that you can do right off the bat

and that people

right left and center have sort of

talked about and one of them is that you

can abridge qualified immunity in

certain areas so qualified immunity is

the idea that you're not liable to civil

suit

if you don't do something bad that has

specifically had a precedent

in law so you could do something bad but

as long as nobody else has done the same

exact bad thing before you're not

subjected to civil liability

you could you could experience it it's a

little complicated it's a qualified

immunity

generally means that if i do something

bad then as a police officer if i act

within the scope of my general

reasonable authority you can't sue me

for it

the actual way they do something bad

what if you shoot somebody while you're

operating like right so so the the

reason that qualified immunity as

currently understood under supreme court

doctrine

is too broad is because that the

standard used to be

you would have to act as a reasonable

police officer if you acted as a

reasonable police

officer and you took a reasonable action

right somebody went for their waistband

they had an object in there you didn't

know if it was a gun you shot them

right you wouldn't presumably be

suitable because that's

still reasonable you track a guy down

you shoot him in the back you know

and then you plant the gun on him that

presumably would be suitable right he'd

be personally liable

so the the the the way that supreme

court has done this is they broadened

qualified immunity

to such an extent that you can still

bottom line you can still get away with

some bad stuff

and not be sued for it so that needs to

be curbed that's one thing second

police union contracts need to be

utterly redone across the country

police union contracts right now protect

a lot of bad cops right because the

police unions are designed to protect

the members

the members of the union just like any

other union yeah and so what that means

is that police unions i'm not a fan of

public sector unions generally

um but police unions need to be abridged

in their ability to protect cops who do

something wrong

third you need to have a national

registry of cops who are disciplined

for violation of procedure so that they

can't just leave

lapd and then go work for a ferguson pd

right or something those are some easy

things that you could do

right off the bat but the biggest thing

right now the biggest factor in terms of

lack of faith between police and and

citizens

really is the media because there's been

a lot of talk about the

racial constituency of police forces the

the majority of the lapd is minority the

majority of the baltimore pd

is minority i believe that a huge

percentage of the of the chicago pd

is minority so it really is not about

you know lots of white cops in black

neighborhoods in baltimore it's a lot of

black cops in black neighborhoods

and that has not solved the problem of

people mistrusting the police on an

endemic level

well it's an inherently difficult job a

it's a rotten job man i mean i've

i have nothing but for for good cops

those they're heroes and the vast

majority of cops are good cops and

they're heroes yeah i read

uh a a meme the other day that's very

accurate it said if you have

a 130 good cops and 12 cops

you have or 12 cops that are bad you

have 12 bad cops if you have 130

good cops and 12 bad cops but the 130

won't do anything about the 12 bad cops

you've got 142 bad cops yeah

and i think that that's right i think

that's right i i think that it is also

true

that our standard of what constitutes a

bad cop has

in some ways become much more stringent

so for example

there are cases that become national

stories in which a cop was labeled a bad

cop it wasn't a bad cop

right but there are bad cops for sure

look look here's a great example

the the cops that pushed down that old

man and and where was it buffalo new

york is that where it was yep

granted yep that's [ __ ] crazy i mean

and that's

white on white crime right i mean uh is

a white guy

pushes this old man down and

the most bonkers part about that was the

way the president reacted like oh the

way he felt sam

seemed funny maybe he was antifa yeah

maybe he was undercover like

there was literally the worst possible

reaction

to watching an elderly senior citizen

get pushed down by a young

strong man you mean president trump had

the worst possible reaction to a thing

worse

yeah i mean unknown president trump

having bad reactions look i'm i'm a big

supporter of law enforcement i have a

lot of friends that are cops i know a

lot of friends

a lot of people from martial arts that

are cops from the ufc

i know a lot of cops from jiu jitsu i

knew a lot of cops growing up from

all the different martial arts

disciplines that i engaged in a lot of

cops get involved in that

there's a lot of good cops there's a lot

of good people out there but it is a

[ __ ] insane job and

so many of them have ptsd for sure and

but

i will say that one of the great myths

is that the big threat to the black

community in the united states is law

enforcement it's just nonsense

it's not only nonsense it's

counterproductive nonsense and you're

seeing it but it is a plan right

it is a threat off all these times it is

on a data level an extraordinarily small

threat

law enforcement law enforcement is a

threat to black life on a generalized

level is extraordinarily small the

washington post database last year

showed a grand total of 15

black americans shot unarmed across the

united states in a country of 42 million

black people the problem is

when it happens it doesn't matter what

the statistics are if people see that

video

and that video gets shared 200 million

times it looks like there's 200 million

white cops killing a black guy well and

this is why i say that the media's

treatment of this stuff is just horrific

it's not just the media it's

it's social media social social media

has blown this stuff up

and it's gotten to the point where if

you say that's a horrible situation

that's also an anecdotal situation

here's some data

if you present the data it's like well

you're are you ignoring people's lived

experiences that's racist how can you

present the data the data is

the data doesn't take into account the

full story nobody takes into account an

awful lot of the story which is why it's

called data

right like i just don't anecdotal

evidence

is evidence of an anecdote it is not

evidence of a broad national trend nor

is it evidence

that taking a broad national policy like

cutting back funding to the police in a

time of rising crime

is a good idea because you saw a video

on youtube i'm sorry

that's a terrible idea but when you look

at these videos

the positive side if there is any

positive side

is that it's they're accountable now

and this has been going on forever if

you talk to people that are black that

grew up in

in poverty stricken areas

they will tell you horrific stories

about being abused by cops

and i think the number is like 25

percent more likely

a black person or brown person getting

any sort of interaction with a cop is 25

more likely to become physical or for

them to be abused

that's that's real right when you look

at the statistics of

them being killed yeah white people get

killed more by cops

than black people but there's way more

white people no no even on a percentage

basis when

you have to use the control group of

crime you can't use the control group of

raw population

so you have to look at people who are in

situations where a deadly

interaction is likely there have been

multiple studies that show that black

people are not in more danger of being

shot by cops than white people but

it is true that low-level uses of force

between cops and black people are worse

than low-level uses of force between

cops and white people right that's the

role in friar study

there are a few confounds that have yet

to be sort of worked out i think

probably white people are

less likely to believe that the cops

gonna kill them whereas black people are

probably convinced the cops going to

kill them that might

that might play a factor in why there's

more white people being killed by cops i

mean that may very well be true it may

also be that low-level uses of force is

maybe

of force may be disparate if you think

that the cops likely to be a racist

then you might be more likely to resist

the cop and then he might be more likely

to rough you up so

it's it's very difficult to rub out the

confounds there the one thing that we

know for sure

is that the greatest threat to black

life just like the greatest threat to

white life

is members of your own race killing you

like if you're talking about actual

murders

white people are killed by white people

black people are killed by black people

by people you know

mostly right it's intraracial right

there is there there's very little

interracial crime like black on white or

white on black in the united states

there's a lot of intra-racial crimes a

lot of white people victimizing white

people and black people victimizing

black people

and the question is how do you stop that

this is why i don't know if you saw this

interview it was kind of an amazing

interview terry crews the actor yeah he

was on with uh his own don lemon

right and don lemon uh is doing the

black lives matter

sloganing and terry crews says well all

lives matter

and don lemon says but no black lives

matter doesn't mean all black lives

matter

right but terry crews said all black

lives matter and he said no no not all

black lives matter only black lives

matter we're only talking about police

brutality right now

and terry crews was like why aren't we

talking about all black lives matter

because

if black lives matter means you withdraw

cops and withdrawing cops means more

dead black people

then why wouldn't those lives matter too

and

this is where the slogan nearing gets in

the way of

actual progress because that's where

ideology hits facts right

exactly it gets very weird and terry

crews was called

some terrible names for that but then a

video surfaced of don lemon from 2013

chastising sounds like me on that right

he sounds like me he talks he sounds

exactly like you it's hilarious pull

your pants up get your [ __ ] together

you know like he's literally saying

things like don't have babies out of

wedlock

right stay in school which by the way

again all of this is commonsensical and

true for all races it is not just black

people

young white people in appalachia need to

get their [ __ ] together yes everybody

needs to get their [ __ ] together but

again young white people in appalachia

are dealing with the same thing what's

around them all the time is crime

people taking pills everyone having

babies out of wedlock

people impoverished no hope no

no potential for escape i mean

that i agree but the first thing that

has to change the firs so my dad had a

when i was you know looking to get

married my dad said the way that you get

married

is it's not that you find a girl and

then you decide to get married you

decide to get married and then you find

a girl

meaning that you you have to sort of

make up your mind that you're in that

you're in the mode

of this might be where we disagree the

most

a good way to get hooked up with the

wrong lady bro well you make the life

decision that you're at that point in

your life when you want to make a

decision

along those lines get married when you

love a girl so much you're willing to do

something so

[ __ ] stupid that you're willing to

get married to her because

getting married to her is how is where

we're going to get married less

painful to you than the idea of losing

that person

because i look i think marriage

the good thing about it is that there's

financial

protection for the family financial

particularly when there's children

involved i think that's when it's the

most important thing

you know i think financial protection

for the children look

i grew up without child support my

father was a deadbeat dad

so i know what it's like to be poor

because your father doesn't support you

i think that's horrific i've seen it in

many situations i know many people that

have been the victim of this

it's disgusting there are a lot of

shitty men out there

that don't take care of their kids white

black

asian it's universal that

needs i think that is where the legal

definition of marriage

and protection of children and

protection of the woman who has to take

care of these children financially

i think that's significant when it comes

to

bringing the state in to

somehow another solidify your love like

you know i love you you love me but

let's bring in a bunch of [ __ ] people

we don't know and write it down on paper

that's nonsense well i totally agree

with that obviously but the point that

i'm making is that

when you want to make a change in your

life you first have to commit that you

want to make the change before you make

the change well sometimes you meet

someone that's why you want to make a

change no they attempt for them

okay so not to get into marital advice

here but like

but i have some you know i've been

married for for 12 years at this point

thank god very happy marriage we have

three kids

and the the reason that i say you have

to make up your mind that you want to

get married before you get married

is because you look for a different set

of factors then if you are if you are

if you make up your mind you want to get

married what you're going to look for is

commonality of values who is the person

you want to build your life with

do you share interest you share a vision

for the future

whereas if you sort of fall into it then

you can fall in love with somebody you

don't share any of these things with and

it makes it a lot more difficult later

on to actually don't think they'll like

true i don't think you fall in love with

someone that you don't share

values with i think you you think

they're hot and you want to [ __ ] them

people makes this stuff up pretty

regularly well people are silly people

are indeed silly people do

people tattoo their eyeballs ben they do

a lot of dumb [ __ ]

you live in a world i don't man that's

not my world

i don't have any friends with eyeballs

tattooed but people

make mistakes with they get attracted to

someone physically

and you know particularly men are and i

guess women too i'm just not one of them

are attracted oftentimes by people they

think are sexy

but are a bad choice in terms of a life

partner

right but i don't think you fall in love

with those people they just become

how many times you married a girl just

because they thought they were hot

a lot a lot a lot men period

it's not just jews like the drug of

sexual attraction

is the most sold drug in the united

states it it sells

cars it sells homes it's literally it

sells

lifestyles pornography yeah but that

what is that i mean when you're seeing a

woman with a short skirt on and long

legs

walking like like lustfully around a car

what do you what is she what are you

saying you're saying if you buy this car

maybe you can [ __ ] this girl

that's what you're saying well of course

the worst [ __ ] false advertising we

have in america but

this is why when it comes to marriage i

think that it's important to actually

put your large head before before your

other one uh you know the

jonathan height in his book his book

called the happiness hypothesis great

book

terrific right he and he talks about

this right he talks about the fact that

people make a very large scale mistake

about marriage which is they think that

the passion you feel at the very

beginning is what you're going to feel

40 years in and that's not the way this

works it starts off

where your passionate love level for

somebody meaning like lust and how much

you want to get them in bed and how much

you want to be with them all the time

is it like 100 and your and your level

of

kind of committed love right that level

of love where you have

shared values that matters to you like

this much and then over time after about

like two years the passionate love

starts to decline

and by the time you're 60 then you

better have shared values because

after 60 years it ain't going to be like

it was when you were 20. right so

you have to have in mind what things are

going to be like a few years down the

road which is why i say you should be

thinking about

what your life together is going to be

like before you fall into bed together

that's

sound advice but well at sea that's why

i disagree

because i don't think there's anything

wrong with falling into bed with someone

that you're not going to live the rest

of your life with

that's where you and i probably disagree

yeah i mean i think that it is a bad

idea

generally and again i think that it is a

bad idea because

there's a lot of people out there that

have had some really good times with

those bad ideas

and it may be that when i die i look

back and that is one of my great regrets

my friend but

let me just say that that i think that

the

the the thing that that has been forgone

uh is in my life at least more than made

up for by the relationship that i have

with my wife

so i can i'll go anecdotal there but i

also will i'll go data driven which is

the longer you live together with

somebody before you get married the

higher divorce rate after

so that's the higher the divorce rate

after if you live for a long time with

somebody and then you get married

there is a higher percentage chance you

will end up divorcing that's interesting

i wonder why that is

probably because of the open window

syndrome like people feel like okay i

lived with you for three years why

aren't we married yet

why aren't we married yet because the

guy's like oh the window is still open

and so

they're still completely committed so

once the guy does sign off she's like

why didn't you do this five years ago

well there's some of that and also it

feels like everybody kind of settled

right like if it was if it was i'm so

committed to this i want to get married

right now

maybe they just did mushrooms together

and realize they really love each other

again different world man

you know y'all i have a different

experience from everybody else i dated

my wife for for

three months we got engaged we were

married within 10 months we married for

12 years we're both versions when we're

married so we're old school

it clearly works for you i've tried to

be open-minded with basically every kind

of way that people live their lives

including like couples that live with

other couples and they wife swap

which is i feel like that's complicated

i mean i'll be honest it's complicated i

always think those people are trying to

i i know people that do that and i

almost universally believe that they are

distracting themselves from their life

they distract themselves from either

their career they're fulfilling the

potential

whether it's as an artist or as a

creative person

or as a person who's pursuing a

discipline i really believe that a lot

of times when people

complicate their lives with multiple sex

partners and a lot of times what they're

doing is they're doing it

they're distracting themselves and they

don't realize it at the time

that just keeps getting pulled into this

direction pulled in that direction

it's because you don't have a primary

focus on something that's very important

to you

yes you know and it doesn't mean that

you have to be with this person for the

rest of your life

it doesn't mean you have to only be with

one person but when i see a guy

that is you know involved in swinging or

something like that and

then they're balancing a bunch of

different gals trust me

that you that you're going to waste time

man you know there's not enough time in

this life i mean

it's weird to tie this whole

conversation together but it is true

that if you want to be good at a thing

or be successful at a thing you have to

commit to the thing yes and so that's

true whether you're talking marriage

it's true whether you're talking

educational success whether you're

talking career and people

you know making bad decisions because

distractions are distractions

distractions and distractions with every

discipline and i think relationships are

a discipline

in a lot of ways i totally agree yeah i

mean and it is true that

you know you have to make the the

pre-investment and you have to you have

to make the commitment that you're going

to continue to invest in the

relationship as

time goes on yeah and then that's where

people fall off the wagon it's why i see

a lot of divorces around year three

right as that passionate love kind of

goes down and the companion and love is

the name of the term when the companion

love starts to rise

people are like well yeah but the

companion loving is much fun is the

passion to love

like of course not of course that's just

the way it works well that's nature's

biological trick

the ultimate biological trick is like

look when we were monkeys

hiding from eagles okay you had to [ __ ]

as much as you could and

and spread that seed around because you

likely only had five or six years on

this earth

right and you're dead at age 32. yeah

you were trying to just get as much of

your dna out there as you possibly could

that's still inside of us that program

is still inside of us

and that program is when you see a man

and he's with a beautiful woman but

another beautiful woman walks by he's

like looking at her and thinking maybe

maybe i can do better that's a thing

that is programmed into your dna

but you have to understand what that is

if you're a man and you understand what

that is

you go oh this is nature and it's dirty

little trick

dirty little trick trying to get me to

spread my seed

brett weinstein he illuminated

this in a really interesting way he was

saying to me

what's the difference between beautiful

and hot and i said uh

i don't know what is the difference he's

like beautiful is someone who you look

at you're like wow

that person looks beautiful that's

lovely they have a beautiful face or

wonderful eyes they look great

hot is someone who's wearing like a

short skirt

and their tits are popping out and you

look at that person you go this is an

opportunity for to spread my dna with no

commitment

and that's what that is that's that's

the pull and hot

that kind of hot is what's sold that

cheap

quick fast food sort of thing that's

what porn is

porn is all hot porn is not beautiful

it's not i don't think porn's bad either

but porn is

all hot it's all dirty girls it's all

your stepmom

your dad's off playing golf it's that

kind of [ __ ] you know

it's it's like you you know you you're

the pizza guy you show up and

two girls are having a pillow fight yeah

exactly it's your it's your lizard brain

versus your prefrontal cortex exactly

yeah it's your monkey brain it's that

that monkey that wants to hide from the

eagle

that's what it is it's like it's like

huh i could just do this real quick and

across the board you're gonna you're

gonna have a

a better life it may not be a hotter

life but you're gonna have a better life

if you use the prefrontal cortex a

little more often

yes unless you're hugh hefner i don't

know if he he had a good life or not

he seemed i know some people who worked

with him near the end yeah you seem kind

of miserable

i mean towards the end i'm sure he's

miserable he's an 80 year old guy

hanging out with 20 year olds

what the [ __ ] do you have to say to

these people right it's like you were

talking about with o.j simpson o.j

simpson

had a mostly peaceful mostly peaceful

day

well his life is mostly annoying the

time that he gets to [ __ ] them

when you're 80 years old you only get to

[ __ ] those 24 year olds for like

how long can he last once every six

weeks what do you think well he's on

probably all kinds of drugs that keep

his dick hard but i would imagine

like he couldn't run on a treadmill for

20 minutes

right right at that age so how is he

gonna have sex for 20 minutes

so if he even if he's having sex like

it's probably exhausting

and the rest of the day he's just

listening to them talk about tick-tock

and all kinds of other stupid [ __ ] he's

like

he's like remember when frank sinatra

was here and we were banging everything

inside and he's like those were the good

old days

i was wearing a robe i had a pipe we

were having fun on a tv show

i had my own channel he had a playboy

channel for a while

yeah i think it's the image

of it is way more interesting than the

actual

act of living that life yep and i think

that again

that that goes back to you know every

bad decision people make is is tied into

this is the the image of things looks

way better than the actuality of things

it's true in politics it's true in love

it's true it's drawn a lot of things

yeah

and so you actually have to look at the

actuality of things and you don't want

to be an 80 year old guy i live with

five

24 year old girls you just don't

that guy lived in hell i guarantee you i

bet his life was mostly annoying but

every now and then while he's having sex

with those 24 year olds he's probably

like i can't believe this is real

for that 30 seconds yeah i can't believe

this perfect body and i

get to like with this wrinkly sack of

rocks

that he has as a body he gets to have

sex with this

beautiful perfect specimen of a of a

female human being

and then she's like buy me stuff and

he's like god this is all he has to do

you make me famous yeah yeah worked out

great

well you know the grotto the by the end

it seemed like it was pretty dingy

dude i went there i i really did a

marijuana policy

project uh thing there once and uh

of course sounds like a lot of policy it

sounds like a lot of policy

but one of the things he did was like we

were wandering around it's like an aei

summit you know it's like

when i go to heritage foundation it's

what it sounds like right there

it was it was a fun night well i would i

remember

you know it was there was a lot of

marijuana smoked it was

quite a blurry evening but i remember

thinking like my god this grotto is so

outdated

like it had like a [ __ ] old ass phone

there and

like i'm like how much how many people

[ __ ] in here like how weird is there

just generations of

human residue in here yeah yeah and

maybe not like the best times either you

know

it's like a lot of it it's it's just

it's what you think it is versus what it

is

you know yep well you know it's all

working out of life

it is let's work on on thinking about

what things are rather than what we

would like them to be because

accepting reality is a hard one

accepting reality is a real tough one

yeah that's a problem it's a problem

with advertising too right because

advertising

shows you and social media yeah right

social media is well that's another

jonathan height book the coddling of the

american mind which is amazing

and it is really illuminates and um i'm

waiting for my kids to read it i think

maybe this year is a good

time for my 12 year old just to

understand that this is

this is a real issue with children that

are

comparing their lives to these fa oh

here's a here's an example

i wanted to show you something i haven't

actually put this up anywhere

but this is actually important because

this is so

goddamn crazy i want to show you

something

um this is something that uh

my daughter did uh

this is my daughter is ten

okay that's her

look at that oh my god that's not a

ten-year-old you're right

it's not 10. it's like a 20 year old

right there exactly how's that possible

how's that my 10 year old daughter oh

she would watch a youtube makeup

tutorial or something

she used a [ __ ] app she used an app

that turned

her into it turned her into a woman

like what the [ __ ] is that so like when

you're you're seeing things like that

what is that how are they doing that and

who's doing that so

if you're a girl and you are overweight

or you have you don't like the structure

of your face

or you know whatever is bothering you

you have acne

and you see a girl like that and she's

she's like

can't believe i'm graduating high school

lol what do i do now

and you see this that's not even her

right this is my 10 year old she doesn't

look anything like that

like she showed she's like daddy look

this is what i look like i go that is

not what you look like

i mean what the [ __ ] you just did that's

not what you look like

and so i had her go through this with me

and show me what she did

i'm like show me how you did this like

what are you doing she's using some

weird app like

like was it khloe kardashian the one who

changed her whole head

yeah yeah yeah that like you know this

it's such a recipe for failure

it really is it's such a recipe for

failure because you're always going to

fall short of that

and it's one thing to shoot for better

it's another thing to shoot for the

unobtainable and then be

upset when you can never reach the

unattainable but it's sick

it's it's sick because you're these

people don't even

look like that and then you look at that

and you go

why don't i look like that like they

don't even look like that

right the amount of people that actually

look like that that

that image that i just showed you is so

small

and it's so unattainable and then it has

broader societal ramifications because

then it turns into

stories about well okay well society

doesn't accept me for the way that i am

society values that look and that means

society is flawed and it's like well how

about this how about like

people are flawed society's flawed

you're flawed do the best you can

everything is flawed everything is

flawed but that's not even really what

the problem is

what the problem is we've created a

technology that we're not

equipped to manage we're not equipped to

navigate

social media we didn't grow up with it

we didn't evolve with it

this is something it's involving us now

no it's true it's 100 i mean they've

built these apps that are specifically

designed to be addictive right i mean

they're specifically designed to prey on

certain parts of your brain that are

you're not really in control of that are

mostly subconscious

and that is scary stuff for sure i mean

you can be manipulated by by that stuff

it's you can make people very very

easily very easily

my kids my kids aren't getting like i

seriously will not give them a

smartphone until they're probably

mid-teens late teens will they get a gun

first probably

probably yeah

[Laughter]

i feel like it's better logic i mean i'd

rather that my 13 year old know how to

shoot than my 13 year old how to browse

porn

yes i think that is good logic you know

what's it really that's a real issue

with boys

uh boys that have access instantaneously

i mean if you give a

phone you're basically saying here

little fella go watch people [ __ ]

they're gonna that's the first thing

they're gonna do when you're not around

and there are all sorts of studies that

demonstrate that this leads to

relationship and sexual insufficiency

later and it ain't good it ain't good i

mean this is not an argument to ban porn

or anything but like

the way that it has integrated into so

many really young people's lives i'm

talking like young teens

right what percentage of american males

do you think are addicted to porn at

this point it's a giant

it's got to be 50 right i mean it's got

to be extraordinarily high percentage

and none of that is good for

relations between men and women and then

you got this weird dynamic where

it used to be that the feminist movement

sort of recognized what social

conservatives did that this is pretty

objectifying and

not necessarily great for women now and

then it's like now in sex workers which

is weird

it is weird they went completely the

other direction and i just thought in

what

what hugh hefner fantasy did women

decide that all the women at hugh

hefner's mansion were actually

super duper empowered like that does not

seem like the most super empowering

lifestyle

like you make your choices man it's a

free country but my wife's a doctor

and i feel like that's more empowering

than like getting screwed by an 80 year

old for for

you know pocket change depends on what

kind of car he buys her

mom is a doctor she can get whatever car

she damn well pleases my friend what

happened

what happened that that became like

empowerment like

how did what where was this i think

there was a shift and it's a shift

that's happened throughout american

society

that went from the notion

that men were acting like pigs and they

should stop acting like pigs

to what if everybody acted like pigs and

so instead of just

saying that standards exist and people

don't live up to them but the standards

are actually not a bad thing

we just decided you know what we don't

want to be hypocrites we're getting rid

of all standards whatsoever

everybody shouldn't have standards and

if you believe that anybody should have

standards then you're a hypocrite and

when all the standards go then

everything goes

so like i actually kind of agree with

the original feminist idea that

men were kind of acting like sexist

jackasses and they should stop that but

the solution to that was not

okay now women should imitate men at

their worst and that's a free or better

society like i just don't think that

that's

against free country do what you want on

the legislative level but as a cultural

matter i don't think that leads to a lot

of human happiness

i look at it like sexual televangelists

that's what i look at like pornography

like i think that

you should be allowed to rip people

off with a really obvious ruse

like if you're one of those late-night

people that can put hands on people

and raise them from the dead if you're

one of those people i feel like god

that's so obvious

it's almost like a good little pitfall

to have out there in society to teach

people that some folks can be deceptive

and i feel like really manipulative

women

that trick old guys into marrying them

and then take all their money i feel

like that's

that's yeah that's deserved at a certain

point you're like

okay i sign off on this come on stupid

yeah you didn't see this coming

it's like this is a great country i mean

it really is like you can make money

doing pretty much anything like when

people say it's hard to make money in

this country

there are a lot of people making money a

lot of different ways yes in this

country and i mean

for god's sake colin kaepernick is

making millions of dollars kneeling for

the national anthem it feels like and

calling america racist while cashing the

check this is a great damned country

well we're now we're getting into the

weeds

i just wanted to talk about girls

ripping dudes off i know you did but we

can go back there man

that's okay but the colin kaepernick

thing

all right don't you think that

at least some good has come out of

him doing that where it sort of

raised awareness for police brutality

just let it just put it to the forefront

let people

like let people understand that this is

a problem

no no no because i think that he made

a serious error which is that the most

positive movements in american social

history

have been ones that don't kneel for the

flag but say in the name of the flag you

should do x

right so martin luther king said in the

name of the flag civil rights are

necessary

booker t washington said the name of the

flag civil rights are necessary they

didn't say the american flag stands for

racism and jim crowley so the american

flag stands for something beyond that

live up to the american flag but here's

here's mine trashing the american flag

is like endemic of police brutality is

first of all it's [ __ ]

but second of all it's actually divisive

on an issue that does not need to be

divisive like nobody is in favor of

police brutality nor should anyone be

right here's the counterpoint why is it

trashing the american flag to take a

knee

isn't that in in some ways just another

gesture of respect like you're not

doing what everybody wants you to do

which is put your hand over your heart

but you're doing something that's also

respectful

and silent you're not standing up and

going [ __ ] the american flag

[ __ ] these people you're actually taking

it to another level of respect you're

taking a knee you're bending the knee

whether you're doing it for something

that you want to talk about later saying

i'm not going to stand up because this

is my way

of acknowledging the fact that there

have been

a lot of people that have been

mistreated by police and murdered by

police and this is how i do it this is

how i treat

racist police killing black people i i

take that moment to take a knee

like how is that so disrespectful like

how is that

any it's a just a silent gesture it's

not

uniform like it's not doing this thing

that everybody else is doing

but you're doing something that's very

respectful you're taking a knee

um well that's certainly not the way

that he intended when he first started

that way i mean if you want to interpret

that way you can

how do you know what his intention is

because he literally talked about it i

mean he said that he

wanted to highlight that right he said

but he said america

is a systemically racist country he

worked socks with pictures of cops as

pigs on them

oh yeah i don't know oh yeah i mean

colin kaepernick is a terrible

spokesperson for this moment

like again like these are there's so

many people that have

taken a knee and don't you think that

but if you just look at the gesture

itself

isn't taking a knee even more respectful

than standing with your hand over your

heart i mean

then i imagine millions of us would

routinely take a need for the american

flag i mean the idea

wouldn't if that was the thing you had

to do if the id but again this guy

decided to stand and put his hand over

his heart

really it's just it's sort of a

traditional thing we're arguing over

well

i mean it isn't the way that it was

originally expressed it sort of morphed

over time right to the point where it

doesn't necessarily mean what he

originally meant it's not like he's

going

[ __ ] you while everybody else has their

hand over their heart in silence but

he's taking a knee he he didn't mean it

as an fu i mean there's no question

that's what he meant it is

he and it wasn't even over something

that actually made sense like you

understand during the civil rights

movement

when people are raising the black power

fest at the olympics to say

like we're fighting for civil rights jim

crow is still in operation around the

country

right colin kaepernick taking the needs

to symbolize that america's police are

systemically brutal and racist

is just it's factually untrue and to

attribute that to the american flag is

really kind of nasty but he's not a

statistician right so he's looking at

things like the eric gardner case or

you know which is a terrible one right

there's there's

cases that you see like when the guy's

just selling loose cigarettes and

they're struggling

from the store it's a terrible case you

see something like that and that

motivates him to do that

and i know what you're saying that these

are anecdotes and this doesn't

encompass the full statistics of cops

versus black men and how it what what is

exactly is happening but that's not his

area of expertise anyway he has

he has that so making him a spokesperson

for a movement where he has no expertise

is a weird thing to do

there are plenty of people who talk

about this with actual statistical right

but if you're knowledgeable

a famous person and you you decide to

take this big stand publicly like that

after you get benched for blaine gabbard

yeah i have to get bench for blaine

gabbert and take millions of bucks from

a major corporation

is that the guy yeah the immortal blaine

gabbert the hall of famer blaine gabbert

who played like no no

no blaine gabbert was an nfl quarterback

who sucked i mean he was terrible and

they they benched colin kaepernick for

him and it was after he got benched that

he started doing the kneeling for like

for the american flag i am a pretty good

gig

sports broadcaster who knows nothing

about sports

listen people try to talk to me about it

if you explain it the way that you're

explaining it meaning we're not living

up to the american flag which is why i'm

kneeling

i wouldn't be arguing with it he didn't

explain it that way that wasn't that

wasn't the way it went down

but it's just him what do you think

about god there's certain guys that like

lock arms during the american fight i

never promised that okay locking arms

okay but kneeling is bad

well no well the way that he

characterizes kneeling was bad okay

meaning like

but what about other people that neil if

they characterize it differently it

means a different thing okay

right i mean meaning like what it

originally was is what it was

i'm not gonna retcon what he meant at

the time he was the first to do it right

right and then he and then he made

millions of dollars for his bravery

again

i don't think it takes a whole hell of a

lot of bravery to be benched for blaine

gabbert take a knee

make millions of bucks from nike i wish

i could play explain gabbard

fellows terrible qb rating is all you

really need to know

not a good quarterback is the answer so

is colin kaepernick i mean i don't

as a an athlete is he not good

like he's a terrific athlete he's just

not a very good quarterback okay so i

mean he he had one fantastic season he

led the the 49ers to the super bowl and

then like a lot of kind of

one-hit wonders in sports people kind of

figured him out season two and his qb

rating started to decline

but i mean look bottom line is that the

making him the spokesperson of a

movement where he really

i don't like the idea that you are going

to attribute to all of america

a sin that is number one anecdotal in

nature

and number two cannot be attributed to

america's highest ideals you're doing it

wrong if you want to fight police

brutality

say america is not living up to her

promises say that

the promise of america like there is a

way to conv

every successful social movement in

american history has done this the gay

rights movement did this the gay rights

movement said listen

everybody in america has been guaranteed

a certain level of freedom and we're not

being guaranteed that level of freedom

right the freedom to pursue happiness is

not being guaranteed to us we're just

asking that we'd be left alone leave us

alone

and it took time but most americans came

around to that perspective the the same

thing holds true

on race the same thing holds strong

police brutality if you make an

invocation and you say to americans as

americans

i know that over time my fellow

americans are going to come to realize

that they need to live in accordance

with the fundamental principles that

founded the country

that's unifying to say that the american

flag is inherently non-unifying

is is really bad like to the point where

you now have college campuses where if

you fly an american flag

there have been cases where people are

asked to take it down because it's too

divisive like that

that's that's that that does seem crazy

when you say

it's anecdotal that you know you know

he's reacting to something that's

anecdotal but there's

many of those anecdotes and you see them

over and over again the problem is

they're so they're they're so prevalent

there's so many videos

so this is my friend joe schilling is a

kickboxer and his

entire instagram has been dedicated to

bad cops over the last few months

just showing all these videos of bad

cops i mean

yes it's anecdotal but god damn there's

a lot of anecdotes well there's 330

million police interactions every year

so

yeah i mean that's what was the initial

interaction that what was his motivation

to do that was there an

uh a single instance of police brutality

that caused him to do that trying to

remember which season he did this this

would have been

three four years ago so i'm trying to

remember i don't think it was the

michael brown situation because i

remember there were protests in the nfl

over michael brown

right which was actually a bad anecdote

like that was a bad one for people to

pick people doing the hands up don't

shoot that didn't actually happen right

he actually tried to grab the gun from

the cop he the gun went off in the car

he charged the cop

by witness testimony all the witnesses

were black you know the eric gardner one

is much cleaner right well

the eric garner one is cleaner in terms

of police brutality it's not super clean

in terms of racism or even cause of

death

so this is one of the problems police

brutality police brutality for sure it's

kind of like

it's actually you know i'm warning

people now that what happens in the

george floyd case with derek calvin

like they should be warned up front i

want this police officer punished i

think everyone wants the police officer

punished

the defense is going to make a case that

the police officer is not responsible

for

george floyd's death in exactly the same

way that the new york police officers

made the case that they were not

responsible for eric garner's death

and the autopsy the the initial autopsy

tends to support that so

what that suggests is not that derek

calvin is good or clean or decent

but if you're going to charge him with

murder that's that's a hard charge to

make just on a legal level

so i'm warning people now of that

because the the move the next move will

be

obviously the system is racist if derek

shaven doesn't get convicted of

first-degree murder

it's going to be very hard to convict

him i think you're charging him with

second it's going to be very difficult

to convince him

to charge for a second right because at

first would mean pre-meditation right

third well he was charged with third

originally and then keith ellison the ag

over there elevated it's a second degree

i think that's very difficult to make

the case for for second-degree murder

what were you pulling up jamie you had

something you want to say yeah i had the

part of when this

actually started in 2016. he started

i just keep doing that he started by

sitting

and people started getting video of him

sitting as the preseason was starting

so he then talked to a teammate they

discussed kneeling was the best thing

for him to do at the time

um do you remember do you know which

incident kind of kicked it off that's

why i was gonna play a video of it so i

had here the actual first video of him

talking about

him donating a million dollars to the

local community i think he had guns

drawn on him

which is probably what started okay but

here's him talking about that

and i've been very blessed to be in this

position and be able to make the kind of

money i do

and i have to help these people

i have to help these communities it's

not right

that they're not put in the position to

succeed

or given those opportunities to succeed

and as far as

taking the knee tonight

eric as well as myself had a long

conversation with nate boyer who

is a military vet and

we were talking to him about how can we

get the message back

on track and not take away from

the military not take away from fighting

our country

but keep the focus on what the issues

really are

and as we talked about it we came up

with taking the knee

because there are issues that still need

to be addressed and

it was also a way to try to show more

respect to the men and women that fight

for this country okay so that's better

obviously

but that's him scroll down for a second

because i think that that's his that's

2016. so here's

this one okay look at the one right

below that okay this is the one i'm

talking about

i'm not going to stand up to show pride

in a flag for a country that oppresses

black people

and people of color that's the sentence

right there so that's a different

that the video was four or five days

after these statements were made so he

said he changed

after talking to someone he made okay

right so the initial explanation is the

one that i was talking about okay so he

revised his feelings on it and then well

that's nothing much

it started with kaepernick had guns

drawn on him by cops for being one of

the only black guys in his town

yeah that seemed super reasonable what

he said there about how

having the second take after talking

about the military yeah that's better

military rather yeah although he

recently released a video that sort of

goes back to the original explanation

suggesting that america

is endemically and systemically racist

which is which is a problem that's a hot

take right now it's good

it's very popular yeah that's that's the

big one yeah that's the big one

yeah how do you think we get back on

track

how does how do we find balance i always

hope that things go

really far in one direction and then

really far in the other direction and

sort of

listen i end up in the same place i

always end up which is we gotta learn to

leave each other the f

alone i mean seriously like that's

that's the only way this is going to

work

because we either have to decide we want

to share a country and live together

with each other or

we have to decide we don't yeah if we

want to live together and share a

country

then we have to stop basically making

crazy demands of one another and this is

what the cancel culture is all about but

we

we got we got to stop that we got to

recognize that people may not agree with

you people may do things differently

than you and that's okay like

as much as i just like what colin

kaepernick's doing i don't think that

you should be blackballed from the nfl

if i were an nfl owner by the way i'd

hire him in a second you know the kind

of press i'd get for hiring colin

kaepernick

i'd make a boatload off of colin

kaepernick that's a great deal

so how come people aren't doing it um i

mean i assume

because he's not that great a

quarterback i mean like if he were tom

brady i think that he would

you know be getting a contract he also i

mean there was that whole situation last

year with kaepernick where he

where he wanted to do tryouts for the

nfl and then he sort of broke the nfl's

rules and doing the tryouts and he

wanted to film it a certain way and all

this sort of stuff but

i guess i'd backup quarterback because

here's the thing you're either going to

please

one half of the population or please the

other either he's amazing in which case

you've got a winning team and a great

story

or he gets sacked every other down in

which case half the country cheers so

controversy sells yeah that's for sure

yeah but how do we

i mean this is probably one of the most

racially divisive times in my memory

in my lifetime i don't remember things

being everybody's worried about

everything being racist every single

thing that anyone does syrup is racist

pancakes are racist oh it's it's evolved

into all the you saw this trader joe's

story

you were telling me earlier so trader

joe's is called trader joe's

right which is not racist i guess but

apparently they they

have mexican products that they were

calling trader jose's

and some bored person in their basement

decided to create a petition

that got signed by some 2400 other board

people about why it shouldn't be called

trader jose because that's racist

so apparently it's cultural

appropriation if you're trader joe's and

you make a burrito

but if you call trader jose's then

that's i i think they called it

exoticizing

mexican people-sizing yeah it's making

them exotic and other

so trader joe's pulled it down trader

joe's gonna is gonna not use this

anymore 17 year old called out

a 17 year old called out trader joe's

now the chain is dropping offensive

labeling

like how many hispanics were picketing

outside trader joe's being uh now that i

saw that trader jose beer

right listen i'm italian do you think

papa gino's is that really

you know i mean is that really an

italian who made that company like

how many how many different like

different pizza companies and all these

i would love to see italians

i'd love to see the racial breakdown of

the people who signed this petition i

would bet 90

of them are white 90 right right white

live in the suburbs hate their parents

yeah what did you say what was the word

they used for it exoticized

exoticized they said yeah oh my god that

is so adorable

exoticizing i was talking to you about

um rick bayless who's a famous chef of

mexican cuisine

who is a white man who who adores

mexican food i mean i love the guy i

love listening to his videos i love

mexican food so

watching this guy's videos it's like i

love someone who's really into something

you know i just i get a kick out of even

like there's a guy i used to watch on

pbs

that would make furniture with um

ancient tools i could use like like

ancient

like um uh different old-timey saws and

chisels and [ __ ] and he would make these

wooden chairs and tables and furniture

right but he kind of looked like that

but he was he was really dressed like an

old-timey guy

and he had this old-timey shop and he

would make this stuff and i loved

watching him and i don't give a [ __ ]

about his shitty furniture i don't but

what i cared about was the fact that

this guy was really passionate

about his thing and it was very

attractive to me and i feel the same way

and i watched this guy

rick bayless talk about mexican cuisine

he loves it he takes regular trips to

mexico and

learns how to cook these dishes in the

traditional way and then he talks about

it with this great passion

but the guy just got [ __ ] all over they

were just

like you're culturally appropriating you

shouldn't be doing this you're a

white man let me just say this generally

cultural appropriation is a bunch of

horseshit and the reason it's a bunch of

horseshit is because you know what's the

best in life

all the things that are good from ever

everybody else's culture

like the reason people live in major

cities is to go to

all the different restaurants from all

of the different cultures yeah and why

is cultural

i'm so confused as to why cultural

appropriation is bad cultural

appropriation is the greatest thing that

has ever happened to planet earth

if we're all siloed off into our own

little culture you know how much things

would suck

it would just be terrible so this kind

of yeah this kind of stuff is just crazy

it drives me nuts i look i

grew up teaching taekwondo which is a

korean martial art

i learned to count in korean i had to

speak

all the techniques in korean i hate

koreans clearly i mean that's clearly

the problem i culturally appropriated

the [ __ ] out of my childhood yeah

exactly

it's this is all this is all crazy and

there's no there's no

apparent end to it like there's no

limiting principle there's no limit

there's no limit i read a column this

morning by somebody i think it was in

the washington post

saying that we should just keep changing

the name of everything like literally

forever we should just keep changing the

name of everything she said

you know there's this town and i think i

found a non-offensive name for the town

but if i found something else that was

offensive like three years from now we

should change the name of the town

there's not a case we are living in 1984

right yo orwell talked about renaming

everything man

people will find a way they'll find a

way to be mad

well here's my here's my controversial

statement okay okay if you uh my

controversial statement is

if you have to go this far to find

things to be offended over

there's not that much to be offended

over if you have to get go so far

that you have to be offended by trader

jose's you got nothing going on in your

life

there's a dramatic demand for being

offended and acting like a victim

and they're just like they're actual

victims in this country yes and

internationally they're seriously actual

victims

yeah but we don't focus on any of those

folks right we focus instead on like the

dumbest bull crap you ever heard

you know about about renaming libraries

and listen i'm fine with you want to

move you want to take a confederate

statute and put a museum fine i mean

those guys were jerks

they're they're terrible people fine go

go for it but you're talking about

we're going to fix the world by renaming

washington dc because washington was bad

it's like what did you do lately did you

do washington did like i understand we

don't put up statues to people for all

the bad crap they did martin luther king

had a real bad record with

ladies okay we don't put up statues to

martin luther king because we were

saying he was great with with women

i think everybody was bad with women

back then everyone is bad period human

beings suck

okay so either get rid of all the

statues and recognize the human beings

obviously for sure and there are

gradations of suck do you remember back

when they were tearing down the civil

war statues and

and trump in all his wisdom was like

what are they gonna do next

what about lincoln what about uh they're

gonna take down george washington and

everybody's like oh he's so

crazy meanwhile that's exactly what

they're doing that was what they were

doing the what

i mean in chicago well actually that was

actually christopher columbus who was

legitimately a bad guy

he was i mean yes also everyone

was bad like literally all the people

were like enslavement

brutal brutal treatment of people right

fairly commonplace do you think it's

there's an argument to be said that

maybe we shouldn't celebrate those bad

people anymore that we know

what they now that we know what they

really were not really i think we should

just talk about the bad people like i

don't think we're the only good people

in history

i think they should have a statue of

genghis khan

i don't know what did genghis khan do

that was good that had good results well

he opened up trade to china okay if you

want to put up a trade to china statute

for genghis khan

federation 10 of the population yeah

true enough and

and what impregnated the other 10 or

something

everybody literally raped his way

through asia the point of a christopher

columbus statue is not all the bad

things he did to the arawaks the point

of a christopher columbus statue is we

are glad

that western civilization came to the

western hemisphere i kind of agree with

that principle

i think it is a good thing that western

civilization came to the western

hemisphere and yes there's a lot of

brutality and yes there was a lot of

cruelty we should talk about all those

things

but this notion that the only cruelty

that has ever existed in human history

came at the behest of western

civilization

that everything was a rusoli in paradise

before christopher columbus came

that christopher columbus doesn't

deserve a statue in specific

that we should that that like either

make the argument that everybody was a

product of their time and therefore no

one deserves a statue

or recognized that when there's a statue

of christopher columbus we are not

honoring how he treated the arrowwalks

no one ever thought that we put up a

statue to christopher columbus because

he was really

sweet to the natives on the other end of

that right that nobody

so what is the purpose of a statue like

when you have a christopher columbus

statue like what is the purpose of that

statue

we not we all know who he is we all know

what he did why do we have an

enormous bronze version of him in the

middle of a park

i mean presumably to say that western

civilization arriving here was

a good thing right or to have the

conversation i mean that's that's

it's a monument to a in historical event

right

right or listen columbia university is

named after columbus right

the idea of america as colombia right

which was an alternative name for

america

was after columbus because he was a

discoverer well that's a weird one right

we're we're named after amerigo vespucci

who nobody knows who the [ __ ] that guy

is yeah he's been lost in the time he's

totally been lost but

but there is this idea that has settled

in that we and it's really

of high irritation to me that we are now

the only good people who have ever lived

everyone who came before us was just a

horrible person and we are the only good

humans who have ever like

isn't the world lucky to have us we're

the only people who have ever lived who

are completely sinless and we can look

from our perch

at the top of morality at everyone who

came before us and say that those people

were all garbage compared to us now

there were people who were garbage

compared to us

but i really don't think that washington

was among the people who you can say was

garbage compared to you like i don't

think that you living in 1770 are a

better person

than george washington i think you stand

atop the legacy that george washington

hell built well i have news for those

people that were trying to break into

amazon go history is going to look back

at you like you're a piece of [ __ ] the

people in the future that would never

shatter property and never spray paint

things

and and never attack people for filming

things with their cell phones

they're going to look back at these

violent actions and they're going to

look back

and they're not going to be kind they're

the same one i mean

it's every single generation

hopefully if society doesn't implode we

don't have nuclear war

every single generation is going to

learn from the mistakes of the past and

hopefully improve

that's what we're hoping for and we

should be happy

that we can look back on a lot of these

people

and say we understand now how deeply

flawed they were and what

was wrong with george washington or

what's what was wrong

with thomas jefferson although he did

you know draft the declaration of

independence he was a slave owner

and this is one of the contradictions of

our society and our culture though we

fathered kids with a slave i mean yes

yes i mean

you don't have to shortchange the evils

of human beings in order to recognize

either the direction of american history

or recognize the good things about

people people are a little more complex

than i think we want to think of them

yes and this is one of the arenas that

this sort of gets back to the point

about the system

if you recognize that human beings are

capable of great sin and also capable of

doing great things

what you really want is a system that

that

of checks and balances that prevents

people from gaining too much power to

hurt other people

and what you also want to recognize is

that the flaws

of human beings are not necessarily the

flaws of the system and that just

changing the system is not going to

change the underlying flaws of human

beings which means you actually have to

think through the policies that you're

promulgating before you implement them

clearly if you say this

you're not paying attention to what

happened at chazz or chop

because they they had it nailed it was

paradise for a short period of time

that's one of my favorite stories of

this year because

these people basically took over this

gigantic chunk of seattle and said we're

going to show you how it's done

they wind up being the police they want

to beating the [ __ ] out of people who

did anything they didn't want them to do

including film things

they wind up see you saw murder you saw

massive graffiti you

certainly saw borders there were borders

put up they kept cops from coming in

they kept a lot of people from coming in

enough journalists the beat up

journalists they uh took over private

property so they appropriated private

property these are not buildings they

built

they didn't make a deal they didn't

barter they didn't have some sort of a a

beautiful mutually beneficial

agreement with these people that own

these buildings no [ __ ] you they took

them over they took them over and

started spray painting [ __ ] all over

them

it's crazy but it shows you like your

child-like child-like idea of

what you can do that's better you don't

take in

that you don't really understand that

the founding fathers really did put into

play

into place all these checks and balances

to keep someone

from abusing power and as much as trump

would like to overcome all that

you see time and time again he's a great

example

in in many ways of how this system

really is beautifully engineered

from 300 [ __ ] years ago because the

founders didn't understand the

the problem of human nature which is

people want power and they want to hurt

other people very often

and you still need government in order

to do things but there better be broad

scale agreement on the things you want

to do

or a small majority of people can really

hurt

a huge minority of people right this is

what they call tyranny of the mob right

they were they were much afraid of this

and and that's stuff that is worth

remembering you know the tearing down

that system because you want to build

something more beautiful

if it looks like chas or chop that ain't

a thing what's this idealistic

they have blinders on they have this

this narrow

tunnel vision view of what they think

this utopian future could be

i think they think that human beings are

going to be fundamentally transformed by

a different system yeah so they look at

the problems

one of the biggest problems we have in

american politics is the myopia with

which we look at the united states

so when you're dating somebody it's very

easy to see all the problems with the

person you're dating

when you're married to someone it's

certainly easy for my wife to see all

the problems with me and there are

plenty

but when she looks at all the other

people then she's like okay well he's

less flawed than the others right

when you look at the united states it's

very easy to see all the different flaws

in the united states because of course

they exist this is a society filled with

humans 330 million of them

but when you look abroad and you look at

other examples of civilizations over

time and then you look back at the

united states you think maybe the system

isn't quite that bad because the fact is

that for all the problems we got

the biggest problems that humanity faces

and has faced are not happening in the

united states they're happening

everywhere else china right now is

shipping

weaker muslims on trains after shaving

their heads to concentration camps where

they are being forcibly sterilized

there are actual problems on planet

earth that is not to say there aren't

problems in the united states but they

are not

the same in terms of degree and they are

not the same in terms of scope

and to pretend that the system of the

united states needs to be ripped down

from the inside

and that if you build a beautiful new

system you will shape humanity such that

we are all saints and no sinners

you're out of your mind i agree with you

and it's it's the uyghur

situation is shockingly undercovered oh

my god well it just it demonstrates that

when people said never again they were

full of crap they're just full of crap i

mean it's not true

in the the this is one area where the

united states should absolutely be

taking a leading role it is obvious that

china is a nefarious actor

china's been stealing our technology

china's the chinese government is

attempting to extend its rule of tyranny

over hong kong they just subjected 7.5

million people to their direct tyranny

in violation of trading

and the response has basically been

muted from the western world

and did you see that did you see that

video of the uh the chinese

ambassador in britain being asked on the

bbc about that tape no i didn't

it's fantastic so the bbc interviewer

shows him the tape of the people being

pushed onto trains right

and he says what is this and the chinese

ambassador says

i can't see it i'm not sure what you're

talking about he's literally saying that

the screen is huge it's right behind him

like he's looking right at it

and he acts as though he can't see it

and then he starts talking about the

natural beauty of the region

right he he he won't he won't deal with

it he won't he won't explain what it is

and the rest of the world is just like

well you know what this is where

you know in the sporting world the the

whole the story that's undercover in the

sporting world is the

is the blowback on that the nba gave to

daryl mori the the

houston rockets jam for saying free hong

kong right you can't even get anybody in

the nba to condemn china while china's

subjecting a million uyghurs to abject

slavery

mark cuban just had an exchange with uh

ted cruz the other day

where where he was going after cruz for

something and cruz said

just you know he questioned cruz cruz's

balls or something and cruz came back

and said well do you have the balls to

condemn china

and cuban said something like well you

know i don't want to

i don't want to get involved in the

internal affairs of another country i

thought well that's

that is not an internal affairs question

it's one thing to say i don't want to

get involved in the tax rates of other

countries another thing to say

shaving people's heads shipping them on

trains to concentration camps where you

force them into labor and or sterilize

them

that seems like not an internal issue

that you're not allowed to criticize

really

yeah that's a big one but the the china

thing is so crazy because so many

so many business interests have this

connection with them

and so much of the the money that they

generate

is because of china i mean the nba films

there's

there's so much so much of our culture

that kowtows to china we're so connected

to them that's one of the things that we

really found out

from this pandemic is how many things

are built there how much of our medicine

how much we rely on china

it also demonstrates the lie of the idea

that if you trade with somebody then

they're going to liberalize

yeah and that was that was something

that was pushed over the last 30 40

years real hard which is

we'll help them out economically we'll

have mutual trade it'll be good for both

of us and they'll liberalize because

once they realize it's good to be part

of the world economy then they won't be

pirates anymore instead they just took

all the chips off the table and said

no actually i'm going to double down on

this and we're going to get more

tyrannical not less i mean

she is the most powerful chinese leader

since mao it's incredible

we don't have much time you have a heart

out in one minute i just want to know

what what do you think goes down in

november and how hopeful are you for the

future

because it seems to me like we're [ __ ]

no matter who wins because the chaos

that we're seeing the civil unrest we're

seeing

it's going to either accelerate or or or

or spread one way or the other so i

think that

if we're going to hold together we have

to make a decision either fundamentally

the american system is good but flawed

we need to work on the flaws within the

system

or fundamentally the american system

sucks and was rooted in slavery and

bigotry and we need to rip down the

entire system

the latter is not really a great recipe

so we can have normal political

arguments within the former or the

country is toast

as far as what goes down in november

look right now the polling data says

trump gets gunked i mean right now the

polling data's got biden up

10 12 points in the polls but didn't the

polling data in 2016 say that hillary

was going to steamroll

on the national data nuts on the

national data they were kind of right so

on the national data the final real

clear politics poll average was like

three points hillary won by three points

in the popular vote

the state polls were really were really

wrong particularly in wisconsin and

michigan and pennsylvania

on this one because trump is universally

losing in like all the swing states and

is in spitting distance in texas

he's got a lot of ground to make up

right now listen biden is running almost

the ideal campaign he's not alive he's a

not alive person

and as it turns out beating a dead horse

is actually kind of tough

right he's like because

he's not threatening he's fundamentally

non-threatening you look at biden and

you feel threatened by i don't feel

threatened by and the man's not alive

you can't threaten me with a corpse

right and so and so trump who is

innately volatile and looking for

something to kind of attack is his own

worst enemy it's his own worst enemy

like with hillary

the untold story of 2016 is that trump

didn't win hillary lost people

hated hillary's guts and the stat that

proves it is that people who hated both

trump and hillary

broke for trump pretty heavily right now

people who don't like either biden or

trump are breaking nearly universally

for biden

because trump is so off-putting and you

know i've said for a long time politics

is about the art of making it hard to

vote for your opponent and easy to vote

for you

and trump is fairly good at number one

and he is awful he is god awful at

number two

making it easy to vote for him that

that's that's a toughy

well said well said thank you ben

shapiro always a good time man

always enjoy seeing you all right that's

it bye everybody

awesome thank you
