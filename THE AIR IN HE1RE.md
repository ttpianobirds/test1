The many ways the world breathes together.
 
  BY BROOKE JARVIS F 

or a manwho died ninety-seven years ago,Carl Flügge had a very big 2020.
 
  We paid homage to him every time we waited in a socially distanced grocery line, used a homemade chute to deliver Halloween candy, or yelled “Six feet!”to a child wandering too close to a stranger.
 
  In an age of CRISPR and face transplants, one of the heroes of the coronavirus pan demicwas a German doctorwho,in 1897, measured how far bacteria-laden spittle could travel from the mouths of volun teers.
 
 Six feet,he determined,and so,last year, that became the recommendation offered by caution signs around theworld.
 
  (In Sweden:“Please keep a distance about the size of a small moose between your self and others.
 
 ”)We’ve learned that our breath can sometimes carry the corona virus much farther than six feet, but the number is still useful and seems perma nently etched into our brains.
 
 We are all Flüggeites now.
 
  Flügge was obsessed with hygiene, and for good reason.
 
  In his day, there was little to offer the sick in the way of effective medicines—beyond, say, opi ates or quinine—and few vaccines were available.
 
  The best way to be of help, some physicians decided, was to try to find out how to keep patients from get ting sick in the first place.
 
  At the time that Flügge was measur ing droplet travel, New York City was overcome by a terrible respiratory disease.
 
  Tuberculosis,the city’sleading killer,was claiming ten thousand lives a year.
 
 A local doctor,HermannBiggs,proposed actions that he believed could save lives: report ing all TB patients to the health depart ment,and tracking everyonewithwhom those patients had been in close contact.
 
  (Other physicians protested, calling the moves“aggressive tyrannies”and “offen sively dictatorial,” so Biggs wasn’t able to implementthem fully.
 
 ) He also pushed for people to cover their mouths while coughing, and for patients infected with TB to be isolated from healthy people.
 
  Twenty yearslater,evenwith no advances in medication, Biggs’s careful attention to the sharing of air had helped cut the number of TB cases in the city in half.
 
  Eventually, effective antibiotics were introduced, and by the nineteen-fifties TBwas considered,in the United States, anyway, to have been more or less con quered by modern medicine.
 
 But, in the decades that followed,with the old pre cautions abandoned, the disease began to spread anew in New York, and there was an additional problem: incomplete treatment could lead to strains that re sisted the drugs.
 
  The number of cases per capita doubled between 1980 and 1990.
 
 The pulmonologist Michael J.
 
 Ste phen writes about the debacle in his wide-ranging new book, “Breath Tak ing: The Power, Fragility, and Future of Our Extraordinary Lungs” (Atlantic Monthly Press):“In a time when we had our most powerful antibiotics,NewYork was doingworse than Dr.
 
 Biggs had done ninety years before, with education and no antibiotics at all.
 
 ”The story is a reflec tion of the remarkable fact that, in the twentieth century, an era of astounding medical breakthroughs,simple—and rel atively inexpensive—public-health in terventions saved more lives than clini cal medicine did.
 
  As a doctor of the lungs, Stephen is plenty interested in cutting-edge cancer therapies and treatments for such har rowing illnesses as cystic fibrosis,but he clearly sees his philosophical forebears in the likes of Biggs and Flügge—and even theirsuccessorWilliamWells,who, in the nineteen-thirties, introduced sneezing powder and Balantidium coli into the lecture halls and air-conditioners of the Harvard School of Public Health, More than just simple pumps, the lungs are portals to our environment.
 
  justto find out howfarthe bacteria could ILLUSTRATION BY ALEXANDER GLANDIEN 66 THE NEW YORKER, JANUARY 25, 2021 travel and still reach human lungs.
 
  All of them understood a basic truth,which, Stephen maintains, becomes more pro found the more you think about it:“The atmosphere is a communal space, and lungs are an extension of it.
 
 ” Our very breath ties us to one another and to the world around us.
 
  It’s a lesson that we seem to struggle to remember.
 
  I n countless languages and religions, breath is a synonym for life, as well as for the spirit or soul.
 
  And for good reason.
 
  The Earth spent some two billion yearswith out oxygen in its atmo sphere,bereft of life beyond a few anaerobic microor ganisms.
 
 Slowly,blue-green algae generated a buildup of oxygen, and so created the conditionsthat allowed for the grand explosion of biology onwhich nearly ev erything and everyone we knowdepends.
 
 “Life and respiration are complementary,”the English physician William Harvey wrote in the seven teenth century.
 
 “There is nothing living which does not breathe, nor anything breathing which does not live.
 
 ” He was overlooking anaerobes, of course,butthe gistwasright.
 
 Even plants respire, in a process separate from pho tosynthesis; animals such as jellyfish or earthworms,which lack respiratory sys tems, breathe through their skin.
 
  (A dried-up worm on the sidewalk is dead because it hassuffocated.
 
 ) Our very dis tant ancestors,having startedwith some thing more orlesslike a fish’sswim blad der,developed lungs—a highly efficient mechanism for exchanging internal gases for atmospheric ones—and took to the land.
 
  It’s a beginning we each reënact on the day we are born.
 
  Though other organs function in utero, independent life starts the moment that our fluid filled lungs inflate, for the first time, with our own breath.
 
  And yet,Stephen argues,we have con sistently overlooked the importance of our lungs(and not just by giving hearts all the glory in love songs).
 
 The details of our or dinary breathing—pacing, depth, and so on—get little attention in modern med icine, but Stephen tells us that breathing exercises, of the sort long promoted in Buddhism and Hinduism, may improve notjustrespiratory conditions but also de pression and chronic pain.
 
  Some studies suggest that they can combat the dam aging effects of stress; Stephen says that “mobilizing the power of the breath has also been shown to turn on anti-inflam matory genes and turn off pro-inflam matory ones, including genes that regu late energy metabolism,insulin secretion, and even the part of our DNA that con trolslongevity.
 
 ”The breath of life,indeed.
 
  Meanwhile, diseases of the lungs, which have often been stigmatized as “dirty,”have trouble attract ing research money and at tention.
 
  (“Ignored, under funded, and forgotten: this is the medical history of lung diseases,” Stephen writes.
 
 ) You’ve likely never heard of idiopathic pulmo nary fibrosis, though it affects more Americans than cervical cancer and has a much lower survival rate.
 
  Lung cancer is by far the deadliest can cer in America, but other cancers re ceive significantly more funding.
 
  Even as deaths from traditional killers such as heart disease and cancer are largely in decline in the United States,mortal ity from respiratory diseases is rising.
 
  (And this was true before we lost hun dreds of thousands of Americans to COVID-19, which kills most of its vic tims through acute respiratory failure.
 
 ) Cases of asthma increase every year,and, globally,so do cases of chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease, which is asso ciated with smoking but also afflicts people who have never smoked.
 
  Lung cancer,too,is becoming more common among nonsmokers;in theUnitedStates, someone is diagnosed roughly every two and a half minutes.
 
  Worldwide, respi ratory problems are the second most common cause of death, and the No.
 
 1 killer of children under five.
 
  We tend to think of a lung as a sim ple pump: one gas is pulled in, another is pushed out.
 
  In fact, Stephen writes, “it is an organ alive with immunology and chemistry,one that does an extraor dinary amount of work under extreme stress from the moment we enter this world.
 
 ”With each ofthe roughly twenty thousand breaths we take in a day, air travelsthrough convoluted passagesthat can stretch for fifteen hundred miles,to one of the approximately five hundred million alveoli—tiny,clustered airsacs— that each of our lungs holds.
 
  Oxygen moves from the lungs to the blood stream, as carbon dioxide flows back to the lungs.
 
  The brain stem controls the balance, which must be just right.
 
  Gas exchange has a remarkably immediate and intense effect on the body; one rea son cigarettes are so addictive is the speed with which inhalation delivers drugsto the brain.
 
 When you hold your breath, what feels like hunger for oxy gen is really your body’s reaction to too much carbon dioxide,which turns blood acidic.
 
  When you breathe into a paper bag to quell a panic attack, it works be cause hyperventilating has tipped the balance in the other direction, leaving you without enough CO2 .
 
  Lungs are a paradox.
 
  They are so fragile that an accumulation of the ti niest scars can rob them of their elas ticity and function,so delicate that one of the pioneers of pulmonology solved a long-standing mystery about a deadly neonatal lung disease in part by read ing a book about the physics of soap bubbles.
 
  Yet, unlike our other internal organs, nestled away inside us, they are open,like awound,to the outsideworld.
 
  The respiratory system is regularly at tacked by pathogens, to say nothing of allergens and pollutants.
 
 As a result,our lungs are home to vast numbers of pro tective cells that patrol them like sen tries, and a lining of tiny hairs that con stantly move a layer of cleansing mucus upward, ejecting all the invaders they can.
 
  Our lungs are both protection and portal,the nexus of ourrelationshipwith an environment that can heal us as well as harm us.
 
  In their deepest recesses, a wall as thin as a single cell is all that separates us from the world.
 
  I n December of1952,a temperature in version, a relatively common winter time meteorological event, developed in the skies above London, trapping cold air under a layer of warmer air.
 
  Because the air could not escape,the already ter rible pollution of the city grew so con centrated that,in some areas,people could no longer see their feet.
 
  Buses and cabs stopped running because of the poor vis ibility,and some people blindlywandered into the Thames and drowned.
 
  The air quality was such that even indoor events THE NEW YORKER, JANUARY 25, 2021 67 had to be cancelled, and the press re ported cows dying of asphyxiation.
 
  For five days, amid what became known as the Great Smog, Londoners got to know, too intimately, everything that the city emitted into the communal atmosphere—including coalsmoke,from factories and homes, which mixed with fog and generated sulfuric acid.
 
  Enor mous numbers of people were hospital ized, and, in the weeks and months that followed, an estimated twelve thousand died.
 
  Undertakers ran out of caskets.
 
  For centuries, there had been failed attempts to reduce coal burning in En gland—among them a ban in 1306 by Edward I,who turned to fines, torture, and death threats; and,in the sixteen-six ties, a report written for Charles II that warned about the effects of “filthy va pour”on “thisfrail Vessell of ours which contains it.
 
 ”But the region’s famous air pollution was dismissed as simply the cost of modern life.
 
 Four years after the Great Smog, though, Britain finally passed a Clean Air Act and began its long,slowtransition away from coal.
 
 (In 2020, Britain set a national record by going sixty-seven days, twenty-two hours, and fifty-five minutes without burning any coalfor power—a firstsince the Industrial Revolution.
 
 ) In the U.
 
 S.
 
 , several years before the Great Smog,a winter inversion trapped the residents of Donora, Pennsylvania, in a cloud of emissions from local zinc and steel factories,sickening nearly half the town.
 
  The resulting outcry led to the first federal efforts to address air pollution,although America’s Clean Air Act wasn’t passed until 1963.
 
  People learned the hard way about the lack of separation between themselves andwhat they breathed.
 
  Or not.
 
  In today’s world, episodes like the Great Smog are lessfamous but more common.
 
 In recent years,residents of citiesfrom São Paulo to Sydney have watched as smoke from record fires, fuelled by climate change and defor estation, has blotted the sun from the sky.
 
  In November, 2017, air quality in New Delhi—a city that,like Seattle and Salt Lake City,is prone to winter inver sions—was so bad that sensors tracking air pollution, including the level of par ticulates under 2.
 
 5 micrometres, which are small enough to travel deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream, couldn’t keep up.
 
  (Levels above 200 are considered “very unhealthy”; most sen sors maxed out at 999.
 
 ) Poor visibility caused a huge pileup of cars on a high way, and Delhi’s chief minister tweeted that the region had become a gas cham ber.
 
 But it wasn’t an isolated event.
 
 Last winter, government officials in Delhi cancelled flights,shut down schools,and declared a health emergency because of air pollution.
 
  Millions of children are now believed to have irreversible lung damage, and a local surgeon told the Times that he no longer sees pink lungs, even among young nonsmokers.
 
  We’re still learning all that air pollu tion can do to our bodies.
 
  It can cause not just lung diseases and impaired lung development (in Los Angeles,research ersfound that they could track the prog ress of anti-pollution measures by the increasing size of children’s lungs) but also, indirectly, heart attacks and osteo porosis.
 
 For firstresponderswho breathed in clouds of dusty air following the 9/11 attacks on theWorldTrade Center,many of them without wearing protective masks, health problems often came in three waves.
 
  First, there were persistent coughs,and then,a fewyearslater,asthma, sinus inflammation, acid-reflux disease, C.

 ,and pneumonia.
 
 Finally came cancer, heart disease, and stroke.
 
  In the U.
 
 S.
 
  today, our bad air comes not just from industry but from indus trial agriculture (with its emissions of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and the like); according to some re search, the two cause about the same number of air-pollution-related deaths each year.
 
  Forty-six per cent of Amer icans live in counties where the air is considered unhealthy,raising the risk of disease and early death,with the brunt borne by poor people and people of color,who are likeliestto live in the most polluted areas.
 
  We know the dangers, and we also knowthat,according to theWorldHealth Organization,more than ninety per cent of human beingslive in places where we breathe substandard air.
 
 Yet this knowl edge doesn’t much stir us.
 
  It feels sym bolic that, according to the E.
 
 P.
 
 A.
 
 , air pollution has decreased the distance and clarity of our vision—even in protected natural areas and even in our post-Clean Air Act country—by as much as eighty three per cent, depending on where we live.
 
  We fail to notice how much the air we breathe is literally shrinking our own horizons.
 
  T his pastsummer,the streets erupted in protest after awhite police officer slowly and calmly asphyxiated a Black man named George Floyd by restrain ing him with a knee to the neck.
 
  Floyd repeated a phrase that other victims of police violence had said before him, and that took on an extra resonance amid a respiratory pandemic in which people of color, in part because they were al ready breathing the nation’s most dan gerous air, have suffered disproportion ately.
 
 In the Annalsof Surgery,SanfordE.
 
  Roberts, a Black surgical resident in Pennsylvania, wrote that the parallels of the situation—of patients gasping for air while protesters chanted “I can’t breathe”—were “striking and suffocat ing.
 
 ”The atmosphere may be a commu nalspace,butitsrisks aren’t evenly shared.
 
  2020 was full of grim jokes about what an awful year it was—sentient al most, weaponized against us.
 
  It began with fires in Australia that suffocated untold numbers of animals and sent coughing people fleeing into lakes, as well as an announcement that a pneu monia of unknown cause was circulat ing in Wuhan,China.
 
 As the year went on, the dangerous imbalance of gases that we’ve created in the planet’s atmo sphere contributed to the most active Atlantic hurricane season in history, alongwith record rainfall in some places and punishing droughts in others.
 
  In Brazil,rain forests andwetlands burned.
 
  It was a relentless litany of news that began to seem united not just in awful ness but in theme.
 
  There is no escap ing the air that we share.
 
  On the West Coast of the United States, where I live, wildfires sent the smoky remains of trees and houses and lives swirling across thousands of miles.
 
  You could drive for hours and never see anything but smoke, which turned our usual bluebird summer skies disquiet ing shades of orange and gray, and ren dered the air toxic.
 
 It was another grim joke: it wasn’t safe to breathe outside, because of the smoke, but it wasn’t safe to breathe inside, either, because of the pandemic.
 
 The air had neverfeltso com munal, nor these vessels of
