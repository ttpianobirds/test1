This guy has performed tricks in front of us before the show and even after the show. That freaked me the fuck out. He's a wizard. And be forewarned, there are some disturbing moments in this podcast. I don't want to give you any spoiler alerts.

[07:21]
He is a he's a powerful and strange human being, and I say that with all love and due respect, please welcome David Blaine government podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, joined by podcast by night all day.

[07:41]
It's a great collection. Yeah. This is these are all from plast to sell. Even the sunglasses come off on. Wow.

[07:48]
Yeah, it's pretty dope, just like John Wick and his pit bull, which is awesome.

[07:58]
Yeah. I got Kanye Bruce Lee but the glasses are big as I know. Well this guy is amazing.

[08:04]
Shout out to the phone from plastic so it makes some dope shit. Yeah.

[08:10]
He's amazing but not as amazing as that shit you did in the green room. And David just did some card wizardry that it's one thing that you see when you see that shit on TV, like if I was there, I'd see some shit.

[08:23]
I know what's going on, but when you see it in real life, you like what is happening here.

[08:28]
It's way better like in person than. Oh, yeah.

[08:32]
Well, at the end, I don't give it any way. But the end, literally, a man is holding one of his wrists and another guy is holding the other wrist and he still does the card trick and we still can't figure out what happened.

[08:43]
And when did you get started? How old were you?

[08:47]
I was about five years old when I started playing with cards, but I didn't know what what they were for, really. So I just had a deck of cards that I carried everywhere. But I like the way it felt, you know, just like felt like something cool.

[09:01]
So eventually a librarian was like, oh, we got this like magic self-serving card trick book and you want to learn something? And I was like, Yeah, I wish, of course. And she shows me that silly self working mathematical trick. That's a long process to do, but it's still a cool outcome, like, oh, I found your card.

[09:22]
Right. And my mother, I used to wait for her at the library and she'd come get me when she was done. And when she came, I said, Can I show you this trick? And the librarian was excited for me to do it to her, which is what I do to my friend's kids. I teach them a trick and make them really good at it. And then I'm so excited to see them do it, you know? Right.

[09:41]
OK, so my mother comes, I do the trick and my mom goes crazy.

[09:47]
Like it was like it was the best thing ever. So like but that began the love of wanting to learn new tricks because I wanted to keep making her, you know, react, you know. So that was basically the fundamental start of it. And then also she would take me to Coney Island all the time.

[10:05]
And, you know, on the side on the boardwalk there, there's those weird freak show performances. I'd watch those guys. And to me it was all like magical. So that was kind of the beginning of it.

[10:17]
So isn't it funny how one positive experience when you're young can ignite this chain of events?

[10:23]
Yeah, that changes your whole life, by the way. And also so then the librarian, when I would come, she would give me books and I would start looking at that little magic section that was between like games and puzzles. And I thought I always wished magic would be like not there. Like, it should be like an art or, you know, just so it was always like when you want a magic book, it's always like that silly like kids jokey thing.

[10:47]
But there's like so in that section I pulled out a book and I was like six years old and I see a guy chained to the side of a building, staring out, looking like death is upon him. And that was Whodini. I didn't know anything about what that all meant. I looked through the pictures and he was hanging upside down and stuff like that. But when I went to sleep, I would have these dreams of this guy chained to the side of a building.

[11:14]
And that began my curiosity and love of of Houdini. And then that began my curiosity of like not just like the magic tricks stuff, but like this stuff. That's to me it's more like real.

[11:27]
Yeah. How do those two worlds collide? Because some of the things you're doing, they're they're just insane endurance and mental exercises and then other things you're doing or what you would consider magic. Right.

[11:41]
So so I love both separately, like independently. Like I always love like I had a karate teacher at the YMCA that used to make us all run barefoot in the snow in the winter in Brooklyn and all because, you know, we're young, we're like six, seven. And all the kids like, you know, and afraid they were going to cut their feet on glass or whatever, and I would run in it. And I felt like I could do this because I wasn't good at other things physically, like I was born, my feet turned in and stuff like that.

[12:07]
So I felt like this. I could do these things. So then I learned how to hold my breath. And the reason I learned how to hold my breath was simply because I was on the swim team at the Y also. And the other kids would swim back and forth and they. Join me because my feet didn't function perfectly well, and what I learned is that if I didn't breathe, if I just swam, it would save me time because I didn't have to move my head, dip it out and, you know.

[12:31]
Right. So I would just swim and a coach would yell at me. But suddenly I was no longer in last place. I was like, now second and sometimes first. And that began my like, oh, God, you can actually do what the coach doesn't think as possible.

[12:43]
You could swim there and back without breathing. And then the older kids would come to see me do that. And I would like challenge them. I'd be like, let's see, you could say under the longest go up and down five times. I didn't understand the physiology of it that like going up and down doesn't help. It's more effective to just sit through the pain and just kind of chill. But I would just sit there and they'd go up and come back down and which makes it worse that they'd be out.

[13:08]
And I don't make it worse because the breath holding thing is all about like a CO2 buildup in your bloodstream and it's about a tolerance level to it. So if you relax and efficiently keep your oxygen and not make this CO2 build up more extreme, you can actually hold more efficiently.

[13:23]
So when you have that feeling, everybody has that feeling where you need to breathe.

[13:27]
And that's it's not an O2 deprivation. It's a trigger from a CO2 buildup, which is giving you an alert that, for example, in 20 minutes from now, you will not recover. And I didn't believe that either.

[13:39]
Some magician friend of mine who's amazing and one of my, like, heroes in life, he he told me a story as I was doing, like buried alive.

[13:52]
I think he said, you know you know, the Navy SEALs, you know, they black them out under water so they're not afraid of drowning. And I'm like, that can't. No way. Like, because it seems so abstract, you know, so but it's stuck in my brain. And then when I wanted to do the water tank start and I started learning about free diving and stuff like that, I suddenly realized blacking out is pretty straightforward, like a blackout.

[14:17]
And then you get your head above the water and if you're supervised, you're fine. So when I went to San Diego with the SEALs, I watched what they do and I actually did it. But I didn't blackout. I went back and forth a few times and pulled. But they have that viewing pool and they roped the SEALs up to some 45 pound weights and they have to walk across the bottom of the pool and the instructors, something above them.

[14:36]
And when when the seals black out, they cut the rope, bring them up to the top and they're fine.

[14:41]
But what that teaches you is that you do not need to worry about being underwater, because if you're with a team and by the way, nobody should try this, you know, there is extreme dangers to shallow water blackouts which lead to death. But if you are in somebody that's training and you have a team and you want to push it as soon as you black out, it's like getting knocked out. But it feels better. It's not like getting knocked out with a punch.

[15:06]
It's like, you know, but no. Yeah, but choked out of EUFOR, right. Yeah, exactly.

[15:13]
Except this one's even better and then you have all these dreams.

[15:16]
No, no it's not exciting that part of it.

[15:19]
Whenever I wake up from a blackout I'm like, whoa, that's how people wake up when they get out. Really the same. Yeah. When people get choked out they wake up almost like they were dreaming. Like sometimes they think they're at a disco. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[15:32]
It's amazing. They're like, what. Yeah, yeah.

[15:36]
And it's not the best thing in the world for you, but it's way better for you than getting knocked unconscious.

[15:42]
Yeah. Yeah. Cheesehead. Yeah. Choked out is just it just shuts off the blood to the brain. Right. The brain shuts off. Yeah. And then it comes back online but there's no trauma. Right. Yeah but it's not.

[15:53]
Yeah. So it's like a blacking out and blacking out underwater thing.

[15:57]
Probably not a good idea to do too many times though right.

[15:59]
No you could do it. I mean I've blacked out underwater a lot. I by the way so many times I don't know, like between twenty to thirty. I mean I think wow. By the way you guys are talking about me on the thing about the breath, whole thing. Yeah. So yeah, one time I went twenty minutes and two seconds. I almost did what you were talking about, the length of a show that I did.

[16:20]
Twenty minutes and two seconds and I had telemetry there and I had pulmonary experts and everything like that and my heart rate dropped to eight beats per minute hold shape and they pulled me up because they were freaked out like you were dying.

[16:32]
Yeah, but back to racing is the reason besides the Navy SEAL story that I knew that it was it made sense because you hear about the kids in the news, like in 1984 or whatever it was, a kid was under an icy river for 45 minutes. Yeah.

[16:47]
With nothing blacked out, unconscious, underwater for forty five minutes. They rescue him out, pull them back, recover him and full recovery.

[16:59]
So there's something that the body does that we don't understand it. But if you actually. So because he blacked out and because it was so cold, the blood, something occurred, we're all like the same as when you get cold, the blood rushes away from the extremities and protects the vital organs. And because he didn't inhale the water, because it was completely out of it when they recovered him, they didn't even. To get water out of his lungs and he was perfectly fine.

[17:22]
Wow. So but but that just shows you that there's like certain levels of of what the body can tolerate that we have no idea.

[17:32]
So you in learning how to swim and learning how to go all the way back and forth and holding your breath. This started this idea of holding your breath for an extreme long period of time, like what had been the record before you had like 20 minutes. And how many seconds?

[17:47]
Two seconds. Yeah, we did. Yeah, but that was done. So what have you done before. That would have been your record.

[17:52]
So when I was a kid I heard as I start reading about Houdini has like proud record of his lifetime and he's the underwater escape king for 100 years ago. And he had he was around the best swimmers and he had access and he got up to three and a half minutes.

[18:06]
So by the time I was like teenage Earl, early teenager, I got to three and a half minutes.

[18:14]
Did you think that that was a barrier that couldn't be crossed?

[18:17]
Well, I came I blacked out as I came out, but I didn't know what that all meant. Right. So I blacked out. Was that size like that? Three thirty. Seems like the edge. But then when I started working on the actual concept of like, how long can you hold your breath for? Then I started looking into and I'm like, oh wow. There's like people that can do five minutes, six minutes, seven minutes.

[18:38]
And then there was a hypothetical record of of a hypothetical 13 minute record, but no evidence of it.

[18:48]
And that was, um, Pirotta.

[18:50]
So it was a hypothetical period to record of 30 to when you say on Purita was the process that flushes everything out.

[18:56]
So you start to need to hold on to pierotti courage really hard on purities, which is like hyperventilates, gets rid of the CO2 and gives you more room for oxygen. And by the way, I just went up to 25000 feet in an airplane, ascending at 500 feet per minute, doors open and everything. No oxygen. And I was with Luke, who jumped from 25000 feet with no parachute landing. And he was with me and two other the pilot and two other guys were just right under 25.

[19:27]
There's a 24 seven and.

[19:31]
He said, let's see who goes hypoxic first, right? So no, no, no, but we have no, but you have to take the Oct, the 02, you have to take the two miners.

[19:39]
You have to be on the right. So and I was already in a hyperbaric chamber with the FAA at Oklahoma City and I started purging just to see what it would do. And my level, my oxygen levels shot up, which nobody believes is possible. So I get into the airplane and we put the monitors on and everybody's around the same. I was actually lower than look. I was like at ninety whatever 596 he was like 97. He's like, oh, I'm going to go get a joke and as soon as we cross 15000 feet.

[20:10]
His slowly is starting to come down and I start doing the breathing technique, the. Purging out, like I said, right, my oxygen levels and we filmed all this shot up to 98 and then 99 percent as I went up to 23 plus thousand feet. Now, these guys think I'm a magician. So they're like, yeah, I like fake news. That's what the paper looks to the levels because he was recording it. So I took his monitor off of his finger and he took mine.

[20:44]
I put his monitor on my finger, put mine on his back. His was dropping around 70 and mine was 98, 99. Then I switch. I switch with everybody on the plane and the oxygen levels with the breathing all the way up to that altitude. And I'm not recommending this because I haven't tested enough in it. But they did stay up at 98, 99.

[21:07]
And so my evidence for that was you hear about all the Sherpas that go up to the top of Everest, up to twenty nine thousand feet, and they're not bringing oxygen. I get it. They're acclimating, but they're still at twenty nine plus thousand feet. So they're doing something that's allowing them to rewire their ability to not go hypoxic.

[21:30]
So this breathing technique, you're essentially exhaling more than you're breathing in. So you're breathing a small amount of. And that I fill up everything for full, but I've been full like Tom the Modibo hold for a second and then exhale slowly.

[21:47]
And I like, for example, if when we're done here, if you have 20 minutes, I'll get you up to four and a half minute breath old. In 20 minutes, and this is just through these breathing techniques, when we're done with this, I'll show you how to do it and you will get up to four plus minutes for sure.

[22:04]
And how did you so you've learned you could go three and a half minutes or three minutes plus, right? Yeah. And blackout. And then how did you have it in your head that you were going to eventually get 20 minutes?

[22:17]
OK, so you really want it here? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's a long time ago. Let's go again. I forget where I'm going. OK, so you might have to remind me we're going. Yeah, OK.

[22:27]
I just want to know the process because it's a little injection by trade. Well, first of all, I like Whodini, so I love magic, but I like Houdini.

[22:35]
And Houdini was like king of guards as well. But he's a guy that's doing real things. Right. And then I like guys that are like as I go, I go to the Museum of Broadcasting because there was no YouTube or whatever. So I'd look at like these magic.

[22:46]
You search magic and I'd find like guys that would like drink a gallon of water, drink a liter of kerosene, he would float all the kerosene on top of the water and then he would spit out kerosene out of his mouth, look like a human dragon, and then put the fire out with a gallon of water.

[23:02]
So it's that it is magic, but it's a it's art. It's mind blowing. It's a it's a performance. It's not like it's incredible. Now, look, there's guys that are card guys that are like that. Also, like lots, lots of people I love. And they do the cards in a way that's like. But but that act to me was what pressed a button.

[23:24]
It was like, whoa, like, how is he converting his body to do a trick? And there's a guy today performing called Stevie Star, who's called the Human Regurgitator, but he swallows crazy things like so he combines magic with his ability.

[23:39]
So he went on Jay Leno, I think was car Carson. He takes, you know, the little film canisters that used to drink. So he puts a film canister empty. It closes it for, you know, you get the 30 and then he goes and then he swallows it. So it's it's yeah, it's gone. And he goes, like, that's gone.

[23:59]
Then he would take a bunch of water, drink that, and then there'd be a cup with a goldfish in it, drinks a cup in the goldfish.

[24:08]
And then you have Jay Leno signed the cap, the the lid thing to the thing with the piece of tape and sign it. Right. Then he'd take that. Now everything is gone. Then he does these weird sounds and movements, which is part of his show. Right. And then he brings it up, spits it out, and the film canister is sealed. It is the water and the fish and it's sealed with the signature.

[24:34]
So to me, that's like the coolest magic because your take because when you see a trick, you know, like, oh, that's cool, but it's a trick. So it's like you're being removed from being able to, like, absorb. But when you see something where somebody is doing something crazy and it seems like a trick, but it's also like, wait, this is real because he's really doing this. It's just way more exciting.

[24:54]
You know? I understand. I understand. It's just. Do you know how he did that one?

[25:00]
Obviously, yeah. I talked to yeah, I talked to him all the time. Yeah. I'd love Steve Stephy star.

[25:05]
You know how it was done. But you can't reveal that, right?

[25:08]
Yeah. And OK, there's another guy, Tom Mollica, who he passed away and he was this guy. He's the first magician I ever saw. He did a simple card trick and I was crying.

[25:19]
I think it tears. I was like, oh my God. But and he passed away and I filmed that. And he's going to do a really amazing piece of that because he is incredible. He also was on like Johnny Carson shows.

[25:32]
What he would do is he would take a pack of cigarettes, throw them into his mouth one at a time, like them on fire, bring them back out and then throw them into his mouth one at a time.

[25:42]
He always say, yes, there is so much to eat, like, wow, that's great.

[25:50]
How fast they pull back up. It's not that it's young Jamie.

[25:53]
Oh, is you. He's a wizard. Yeah, he's a wizard. So he takes, by the way, the sack kill them. So that's how dedicated to his craft he did it. Really. Yeah. Look, he was eating a pack of cigarettes every night on stage.

[26:05]
I mean just swallows them. And while those light cigarettes are.

[26:09]
Yeah. And then but wait he also throws them into his mouth like oh my God.

[26:14]
So now he's chewing them.

[26:15]
What, what is he chewing. He's just amazing. But I get to where he's throwing them into his mouth too. Oh boy. Yes. He throws them into his mouth all the time there. He choose them up, swallows them his mouth.

[26:27]
As I look at the lady. The fuck am I doing here. Oh my God. Look at that stack in his mouth.

[26:34]
And then look, the whole thing goes in. By the way, he also throws them one at a time. Does all that puts the paper in.

[26:41]
Oh, Jesus Christ. And swallows it all. Oh, my God. Yeah, he he's so. So how did this kill him? Every single night, just one night at a bar, doing cigarettes in your mouth, on fire, eating them, swallowing the bullet.

[27:03]
What did he die from cancer?

[27:05]
Yeah, yeah boy. Yeah, but wait, so so he spits them out eventually or he just swallows them.

[27:12]
I'm not going to give away his genius in the video to the outcome.

[27:17]
Oh no, no, no. God, yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. See that's the thing. It's like I this is a guy that died for his art. Yeah. Wow.

[27:27]
So another the guy was talking about that's like my favorite card was the guy that taught that showed me the Navy SEAL. But just an amazing just as a library he he's like this genius that if he came here but he never would because he would never show anybody anything. But if he did and he showed you a couple of moves, like the first move he showed me was actually a card move called The Sencion, where he makes the card float right through the deck.

[27:50]
And like the greatest magician of all time, the card magician said it was one of the greatest tricks ever done. You won't be able to find it anywhere because it's not a very.

[27:57]
But he he only does it to a couple of magicians. So he performs for, like, you know, a handful of his friends. He shows them move and it's mind blowing. And luckily he showed me stuff and he's young, but he'll never, ever perform. He's like, does a painter paint so he can show people there's a painter paint to paint. But whenever you're on the phone with him, you just hear cards like he's like and he's now and he's doing what he's doing.

[28:23]
I'm telling you, like 13 day long, 13 hours a day, he's doing card moves alone. And I said I was like, Bill, what do you do? Do you, like, do the trick to yourself?

[28:33]
Do you better be? But he said he doesn't believe that it's not to him.

[28:38]
It's not a performance. To him, it's it's just about the technical love and feel of that.

[28:43]
Well, that's not there's a Japanese phrase for that about doing something over and over and over and over the exact same thing over and over again to achieve a level of perfection that is almost physically unattainable to mere mortals.

[28:58]
You bypass what a person thinks the body would be capable of doing.

[29:03]
Yep. Yeah, that that's that's it. That's yeah. That's what he's doing.

[29:07]
That is the thing I if you can you know James Nestor's. Yeah.

[29:11]
Of course. The book. Yes. Yeah. Deep is amazing. I don't know deep but that's breath deep. Yeah. Breath is the one that I read and I had him on the podcast today.

[29:20]
He's an amazing he's talking about this monk that was literally meditating and doing breathing exercises all day long for thirty years and could do these insane things with his body, like vary the temperature from one hand to another, change the blood flow, change it literally from one finger to the pressure.

[29:40]
And that, yeah, the only way you could get to that place is you have to be that guy who sits in a cave and does breath work all day long for thirty years. And most people just aren't willing to do that.

[29:51]
But if you do do that, there are some levels that you can reach that are just unattainable to a normal person.

[29:59]
And even if you would talk to.

[30:01]
But I agree with scientists and dr. No, but is it reasonable to normal people? Because when somebody gets paralyzed or something. Right. I've seen people that the doctors say you're done, you have no shot, and they spend all day of every single waking moment trying to get like a little mo, just like a tiny bit of movement in their little toe. And eventually, if they do what you're saying, if. Yes. So it is.

[30:24]
Yeah, it is that it's but most people are not willing to get to that place.

[30:30]
Most people are not going to sit there shuffling 13 hours a day like your friend. Yeah, but there's people that can do that. Like when I was watching you move the cards around. It's interesting. Like you ever watch a movie where a guy smoking a cigarette, you know, that guy doesn't really smoke. You can kind of tell by the way he's holding the cigarette feels, oh, that's good.

[30:47]
If you're moving these cards around like your the your edge detection, like your understanding of where the it's very interesting to watch your fingers move because they're so they're so educated, you know, because of all the commentary that I do with martial arts and my years in martial arts, it's I'm fascinated by how different people move.

[31:09]
And they do the same thing. They it looks different when other people do it.

[31:14]
There's certain people that'll throw a punch and you just walk out of your go, Jesus, there's something about the fluidity of the motion that's stunning even to this day.

[31:23]
And that was what I was watching you move your fingers and watching you move the cars like this motherfucker, shuffle a lot of cards.

[31:30]
There's a weirdness to the movement of your hands.

[31:33]
But I think that's what you're saying. It's like the punch things. It's like there's.

[31:35]
Yes, yeah, yeah. But it's it is. But it's the you the mind forces the body into moving over and over and over again.

[31:46]
You know, you do it to this level of perfection that for a person like me who does. Anything about cards? I don't know anything about card tricks, I don't know how they work. I can't shuffle. If you watch me shuffle, you'd fucking laugh at me. But I watch your your hand movements and like, oh, this is amazing. It's amazing.

[32:06]
But now there's guys I'm around. I wouldn't even pull a deck of cards out of my pocket if they're near me because they're that guy that does it 13 hours.

[32:14]
Yeah. Like yeah. Like like the guy just isn't that fascinating though. But but yeah. But there's also different aspects to it. So like you know, there's also guys. I can't I'm not going to go into the details, OK, but I met I feel like I shouldn't even say this, but it's fine because it's fine. So I met a kid once who moved to Las Vegas when he was this is a crazy story to tell him that it's a good story.

[32:44]
OK, I won't go into details. So he moved to Las Vegas and he was 12. He moved there because he wanted to meet a specific person who was considered. The best card she ever, meaning the guy, this is the guy that the reason that Vegas has those instead of like the dealer picking the the down card, they have to put it into a machine and push a button. He's the guy that the movie Casino was built around with the computer in the shoe like he was the the best card she ever.

[33:19]
But among magicians, he's like a phenomenon because he's working on movies not to entertain anybody. He's working on moves so he doesn't get his hands smashed up against the wall.

[33:30]
Billions. Mhm. Right. So he's working on Moossa. He's not going to get killed.

[33:35]
Survival. Yes. But so he so.

[33:40]
This kid at the age of 12 knows about him, moves to Las Vegas and buys a craps table. He puts the craps table, Tim and his mom, right, as the single mother and him, they live in this small apartment very close to the man I was telling you about. And this kid throws dice 15 hours a day on this craps table.

[34:05]
By the way, their little bed is like under the table. I mean, it's a small space and it's a real craps table, like a nice one.

[34:12]
The only thing he does is repetitiously throw that and he can helicopter spin the dice so you can't see them doing this.

[34:20]
If such force going around this way that when they hit the wall, one guy won't break the number and he can throw it exactly to this part of the of the table missing this from across the table so that one day locks and every time he can guarantee that, no, he did that every day for almost a decade until he could throw dice better than any other human being in the world.

[34:43]
Then he went and got a job at one of the casinos that text for card cheats and worked in the craps tables. It's all he did. And as soon as he turned twenty one, he went out, travels the world and wins the exact amount of money that he was playing craps where you're not detected. But but you can. What is the exact amount. I mean under you know, under a million. Yeah. Probably a few million years of saying it's not like he's going in and getting for you.

[35:10]
It's, it's very smart and structured.

[35:12]
Yeah. And that's going places.

[35:15]
And he can throw dice like I've never seen anybody throw dice.

[35:18]
It's crazy. I know that they take people that are really good at cards. Like my friend Dana White has been barred from casinos because he wins at blackjack. He's probably just counting. I don't know what he's doing. Yeah, he's counting, but they've kicked him out of casinos because he's won a lot of money, but he's also lost a lot of money, which is bizarre to me that you can go to a place and do really well and feel like you're doing too well.

[35:38]
You got to get out of here.

[35:39]
Well, they also it says every we have the right to refuse anybody, which is important because they do that with dice is the question.

[35:47]
I get the how they would do that.

[35:48]
What do you want to hear? Advice, because this isn't me doing magic. This is luck.

[35:52]
OK, OK, so I don't believe it is. I don't like the way past, but I'm serious. I know, but I'm saying that I'm trying to be convincing. OK, ok. So because I'm telling the truth but anyway I go to the palms you know the. Yeah OK. And they had a bet on the craps table called the bet and it was like a game where you have to hit all of the numbers open and close without crapping out.

[36:20]
So when I walk up to the table right away, the pit boss and everybody, they make a big deal like you can't touch the dice. And they're like I said, you can call up I can touch a dice because, you know, they invite me so I can touch the dice.

[36:35]
And because I wanted to throw. Right.

[36:39]
I don't want to just gamble on a subway.

[36:41]
I have. Because even though I'm not cheating, I still feel like, you know, maybe I'll get it. I have a little bit of an ability that's giving, you know what I mean. Right. Not a cheating ability, but maybe I'm a little better than a random person. Right. Got it.

[36:56]
So. The pit bull, they make a joke and then the woman screams out, she says, well, if you take your shirt off, I'll let you throw the dice joking. So anyway, what I do is I bet for everybody in this I go to the low stakes table always. So the high stakes tables, that Super Bowl team right over there and they're like, they're all crazy, right? Like all excited about these big bet. Be here with this table.

[37:18]
We all have a little bet that I say let's put a fire bet down for everybody.

[37:23]
So I put the fire bet down for every single person at the table, including the dealers. I mean, the pit bull, you know, the you know, with the deicing. And I'm throwing that based on the dice. And this goes on for two and a half hours. I keep telling the banks I didn't hit us, I didn't crap out. I hit sevens in between each number which craps work. So you have to roll like a five, let's say.

[37:46]
And then I'm like, oh, no, I need to roll another five, which is statistically much more difficult than a seven because seven is the most common number to come up. So if you roll a five, you're like, oh, that's hard because you can only get a two, three or three two on both dice or a one four or four one. So you have a four out of thirty six. That's a one and nine. So you're probably going to crap out before you get the number.

[38:09]
That's why the game is to their favor. So I'm the dice and it's two and a half hours later and they stop everything. And they're like, you're fired, but just hit right, and the table goes, what does that be?

[38:27]
They go, Well, you all just won like ten grand each.

[38:31]
And they'll go, Oh. They gave you the Taser. Everybody's going nuts. We hit the fire, but which they've now removed from the polls either way. But it was it was a pretty unheard of. Like the odds of hitting that bet is pretty rare, but it's just luck.

[38:48]
Nobody should hit that bet. I mean, statistically, it's unlikely. And I wasn't cheating, so.

[38:54]
Yeah, so do they. But the question is, I'm lucky for some reason.

[39:01]
I'm like, I'm lucky with dice. Right. But I'm not I but I can tell you, I would be if I was great with dice, I'd tell you it's great. By the way, I actually have a die on this story for this reason. But I do have a desire to have you practice with dice.

[39:17]
I know. Yes, but I'm terrible at it, so I do have it.

[39:21]
But it does make sense that but now that I get what that is, that's a physical thing. And then if you develop a touch, you develop a feel, you do something over and over and over.

[39:32]
Well, this is different. But here, look, take the die, OK? And and can you, like, put it between your hand or whatever like and can you mix it like that and then squeeze it when you're done. No, keep it hidden but put it on the table but make sure you can't see it and I can't see it. You like no one could see that right now. Are you sure. 100 percent. Do you want to do it again.

[39:54]
Try it again. Just no. But because it could be. Wait, it's just or you're done. No, we're good. Yeah you're good. Yeah.

[39:59]
OK, say a number between one and six. I pick a number of the six. OK, that five is what I said on the craps table. Right. But, but I already know that it's a four. And the five of us here, basically, how do you know that that's uncomfortable? Could you do that again?

[40:23]
Probably not. You know, we'll do. But stop whatever you want. Yeah, because it could be like a way to die. By the way, that's how people cheat with Dice's. They also take the dye and they flip it and they want it to be, you know, so it's like you throw the numbers. So you said you wanted a five, right? Yeah, go ahead.

[40:39]
Yeah, it's five in the voodoo away from me. Fuck. Is that so weird?

[40:49]
That must be a rush for you, though, just to blow people's minds like that all the time. But see, so it's not you know, I don't think of it. So what happens is the digital fixation part of like the love of just like learning something new and exciting, that's like really the the stimulus is like that that fixation almost like like the meditative thing that you're talking about. But but as a magician that is performing and trying to make TV shows, it's really difficult because you have to, like, keep coming up with new things, which is that's hard to do.

[41:18]
How did you first get on television? How did you convince someone to let you try this on television?

[41:24]
Well, so back in those days, the only magic that you could see and like I said, it was pre you couldn't go watch it or get it or anything. So there's no way to see magic. And if you were me with a single mother in Brooklyn or whatever, how are you going to go? There's no magic. So I never went to a magic show.

[41:41]
So what happened was all of those worlds greatest TV specials were playing and they were called World's Greatest Man. And I would watch them. And they were like the opposite of that. They were like not they were like hard to watch.

[41:54]
You know, it was like glossy, big, like dynamic and luminous is so far away from the whole thing. So I'm like, there's nothing magical about all this. And then. So, OK, I think about it and I'm like, I go up so but I'm doing magic everywhere all the time.

[42:13]
So I'm one of the ways of making money is I'm going into those fancy restaurants in New York City, like those Upper Park Avenue. And I do magic to the you know, to the manager to this. And I'm like, if it can I do magic to the table? And it's like what I did to they're like, do the magic. Like, Oh, that's great as I could. I do magic to the people eating and I won't ask them for anything.

[42:34]
I bought like a nice suit at century 21, like a hundred dollar it was, you know.

[42:39]
But anyways, I go up to these tables and that's a hard situation because it's very difficult to approach people that do not want you near them and try to figure out how to win with magic. It's a and it's like even on the street where if you do it, it's like a complicated scenario. Once a camera comes up, it changes it because now they're like, oh, he has a camera. It's fine. Right. But you'd have to walk up to a table of a a bunch like us.

[43:06]
We're sitting there and something like, you know, sketchy magician kid comes up to us like, hey, can I show you a card trick? And you and I are going to be like, nice to him probably, but not really whatever.

[43:16]
So what I had to learn quickly was like little things that are so important, like distance, like how close should you be to the table or how far? And then you start to really understand the psychology of the magic is way more important than the tricks.

[43:31]
Right? So if you're too close, you're like, oh, they don't want you near them. So you're right. You're like they're like, no, thank you. If you're too far away, it's easy for them to say no, thank you. Right.

[43:42]
So there's like a balancing point.

[43:44]
Just stand where you stand and then who you do the first trick to and then what the first trick is. And so by doing all of this, I started to really figure out how to get reactions from anybody really fast so I could walk up to anybody anywhere and just do magic.

[43:59]
Like one time I was in central booking because I jumped the subway thing. They were sweeping everybody up and there was four guys sitting in the middle playing spades. The only other, like kid that looked like me, it was in there, got the shit kicked out of him. Right. And I'm like, I'm going to get my ass kicked because I was with a button up shirt, like, you know, anyway, so the guys are sitting in the middle that were playing spades.

[44:22]
I grabbed it. I go, let me show you guys something like take the come on. I grabbed the deck of cards and I start doing magic to the fourth toughest looking guys in the cell. Right. Within two minutes they're erupting. And once they're erupting, the whole everybody because central because you moved here, everybody's standing around, go nuts. And then all of a sudden the guards are there and now everybody's watching together. And I'm like, this is what the magic show needs to be like, whether you're like here this was you're this that with young, old, rich, poor, black, white, whatever, everyone wants to see it.

[44:54]
No, no. Everybody's got a good side. Like, there's I want to show that people are all the same, you know, like sure.

[45:01]
There are some that are horrific and do horrible, but at the core of everybody there's like an innocent kid somewhere maybe got really far lost in magic, just pulls that out of people, you know, and that and that's why. And the people say, oh, well, how could you do magic? I do magic to anybody because whether it's like visiting underage kids in prison that like, you don't know what happens them and you see them come walking up with their eyes down.

[45:25]
They don't want to look at you because they don't like anybody there. That's authority. Right. That's what ruined their lives.

[45:31]
And then as soon as you do these tricks, suddenly they're like little happy, sweet kids, you know, you get that.

[45:39]
Oh, that's what and that's what Magic did originally to my mom. I go do it to her and she'd be like reacting. And even if she had a terrible day, you know, she was working three jobs.

[45:47]
It was like this made her happy. Wow.

[45:51]
That's that's a cool origin story then.

[45:54]
And it makes sense that that feeling that you get like when you show something like like the card trick you did in the other room and everybody's like, oh that that oh the oh that you get out of people that that rush that's that, that is because at that moment no one's thinking of anything else at that moment they're like what the fuck.

[46:12]
How did you what.

[46:14]
Oh by the way I've walked many times when people are fighting about to erupt into big fights. I walked into the middle of those fights, started doing magic in those fights. No, I know.

[46:25]
And then the fights were done and everybody's like, do you want to hear the funniest non-magical?

[46:30]
Sure. Sure. Okay, so after the TV show and stuff like that, I get more known. By the way, the world's crazy. But then I was like, OK, let me do the opposite of that. So I called it Street Magic cause I was trying to come up with the lowest name, like I was trying to come up with set expectations as low as possible because the world's greatest ADC like.

[46:49]
So I come up there like card tricks. But anyway, so I'm like driving with my friend, that is. What are those those smart cars in New York? And it's like the coldest day in New York. It's like freezing like a February like 12 degrees out type situation. And we're stuck at a red light and there's a car with these four people outside of it, and you could see they're like struggling like they couldn't get the door open. So they realized they and they didn't.

[47:18]
They lost their keys. They couldn't figure it out. They couldn't get into their car. Right. But I know that that's not what's going on. Like, it's freezing. So I understand the situation. So I could stop one second and I walk up next to these this group, walk up to the car, pull the door open. But I like it. Made it look like I'm just pulling it. But I was giving it for the door opens up and it looks like I did nothing that I get back at the car, leave it.

[47:44]
I hear they go back.

[47:46]
The guy was like the best Rick ever did, but it was just opening up the door, the frozen back, because I knew that it was just frozen.

[47:55]
But that's the same as what magic is like. It's like and what you so and the hole. So there's a book called Magic and Showmanship was all about like what makes magic effective? And it's called like the ham sandwich. He says, if you just said reach in your pocket right now, there's a ham sandwich. That's a good trick. But if you were like, man, I'm hungry, I would love a ham sandwich and I'd already put it there.

[48:15]
And I'm like, reach in your pocket.

[48:17]
And then there's that's real magic. So it's just context. That's where it's so baffling because then people walk away.

[48:25]
How the fuck did he know I was going to say a ham sandwich like the folded car that you somehow or another shoved into Jeff's wrist, into his below his watch where?

[48:35]
What? I mean, I know there's something to it. I don't know what you're doing, but that oh, the result the oh is pretty, pretty phenomenal.

[48:45]
But in that moment no one's thinking of anything else.

[48:48]
Yeah but it's all short. No, but there's also a lot of people that are trying to figure it out there. There's a lot they're still going.

[48:55]
Oh they're not. Even if they're trying to figure it out, they're not thinking of anything other than that trick.

[49:01]
Right. Moment, something you might be trying to figure it out. But they're still they're not thinking about, oh, I got to feed the dog. And now they're thinking about they're like good friends of their budget.

[49:11]
They like to know about that. Yeah. We can all get too accustomed to things. Yeah.

[49:20]
So you you first get on television, you first do these things and then your magic evolves and your magic goes from being just magic to some of the more insane things you've done, like standing in a block of ice. For how long did you do it for. Seventy. Sixty three hours straight. I'm always late so I showed up late so I missed like what the length of time I was supposed to do. So that's all. But I'm always late.

[49:44]
I made it here on time though, didn't I.

[49:46]
You were early. Yeah. Yeah, perfect.

[49:48]
But I rode the motorcycle here and was lying because I had to make I wanted to be on time. So if you were on time. Yeah.

[49:55]
The the ice thing. Why what made you decide to stand in a block of ice 60 hours.

[50:01]
Well I'll tell you that. So you were saying how do you go from the magic tricks like to these to the extreme physical endurance and so studying Deenie and all that stuff. And then there's a poster of Whodini that I loved where he was. It was he was buried alive, but he never did the stunt. He died before he got to do it. But he was going to be buried alive underground in a coffin. So I sterrett I love that poster since I was a kid.

[50:23]
It's like in the magic books. You see that poster. Yeah. And anyway, so Bill, again, the guy I told you about, Bill Colludes, comes up to me and he's like, what about this? And he shows me an image of Indian Faqir that was buried alive for a month. He's like, what if you pretend to be buried alive in Central Park? We'll sneak you out and he'll come back a month later. And I was like, I always wanted to do like Houdini like things, but I never wanted to copy.

[50:46]
But that one, he never did. So I was kind of like, well, that's interesting. But what if instead of doing it the way he did it, what if I did it and everybody could see that I was buried alive? So what if I was really just buried alive?

[50:59]
Like, it can't be that hard. He's a gag. You can't do that. And I was staying at his place. So we got a coffin from Queens where actually Houdini was buried. I bought a coffin. We brought it back to his house. And then I would just practice sleeping in the coffin. Then suddenly, yeah, I know. But then suddenly I realize he'd only food. And then if you have a little thing to go to the bathroom, I did four days like nothing.

[51:18]
So I'm like, OK, I can do a week. And that was it. And then then I pushed the idea of doing the buried alive and convince people to let me do it publicly. You know, what's funny is like firemen and stuff like would come to the stop in the middle of the night and they would shine like holograms at me and their lights and stuff, and that's the ice. But and then they would assume that I wasn't actually in there.

[51:39]
OK, so here. So back to this.

[51:41]
I'm well well let's go. But let's not jump around. So the buried alive thing. Yeah. Where did you do it physically. Where that was in New York City on the west side. Trump had like this bunch of properties that it was developing. And I was like, I want to be buried alive. I'm one of your properties. Is that possible? He's like, sure, he's a driver. And I went around and that's what I did.

[52:04]
My first thought was, how could they see you and then give me another one who I do who like others there? Yes, so it was see through but right. And then we put six tons of water on top of it. So that's basically it.

[52:16]
And then so it was there.

[52:18]
And how are you getting there was to see those two big holes. So the oxygen was being see the holes above my head right there. So the air was being blown in and out. But it's pretty straightforward like that one's not to me, not that impressive.

[52:31]
If I said to you just laid there for a week. Yeah, but, you know, the hard the hard part, I mean, your body and you lose weight. But the hard part of it is you wouldn't you would never anticipate this being the hard part. But if you're not used to like peeing while standing in front of lots of people staring at you, it's actually really hard.

[52:52]
So it's like very low life. And I had the truckers to on and all that stuff, which is like a con with a cap or whatever. And and people are there the whole time, like it suddenly became like an event. And so there was never like and I they were like, oh, we'll cover it. No one can see. I'm like, no, then people are going to think I'm sneaking in and out.

[53:10]
So I had to learn so I would close my eyes. Like when you were kids sleeping, you'd have those dreams. I'd have matters of it. It would take me hours. I would be able to pee. Right. But that and by the way, I didn't eat for a few weeks before, so I had no food. That was the other was an issue. But what happened by midway through the stunt, I'd be waving and smiling like pee and it was like nothing, you know.

[53:34]
But these are things that you don't consider when you're practicing in your role, often in your house.

[53:39]
So you didn't eat for how long? Two weeks before. Yeah, yeah.

[53:42]
But I was always into fasting. I read Siddartha as a kid and I had done like a week with just water and, you know, knew all of that, knew the body's really good with that.

[53:53]
So you were comfortable with the fact that you were able to fast and that wouldn't be an issue. Yeah. And you were comfortable with the fact you were getting air. Were you drinking water from how are you getting water?

[54:03]
Oh, I had like a little bit of water in there that I could suck do a thing like that. And that was fine. It was like it was enough. How much water do you think you drank over the week that you were in there? I don't know.

[54:14]
They always say it was like just a little bit, but it was a good amount. It was like, I don't know, probably. Probably three leaders a day or something. Oh, OK. Yes, real. They say he did tablespoons it, but no, it was it was it was like a normal amount, so.

[54:30]
Well, and then, by the way, it did 44 days with nothing but water. And I did nothing but pure H2O. So it's not even like it had minerals in it and body was full recovery. And my starvation expert was like one of the top guys in the world in London. My doctor at the end thought that I was cheating. So they put me on and I spilled water. So something called H2O and their thing things. It's just pure.

[54:53]
Yeah, exact distilled. Right. So I had this right. Which which is irrelevant by the way.

[54:59]
But so I had nothing but pure H2O for 44 days. Lost 60 pounds. B.M. Bone Mass Index dropped 33 percent. Yeah. That's what I was. Yeah. No, no it was bad. No it wasn't. Yeah it wasn't good. But Doctor thought I was cheating because he's a magician by the way. My friends that were with me that are, you know, magicians and the guy building, they're like you need to take these vitamins and they hand me a handful of sugary vitamins.

[55:27]
And I'm like, no, it's just because I if I'm going to do it, I want to, like, actually do it right. And if I would have taken those vitamins, I feel like my metabolism wouldn't have gone into starvation and I might have had irreversible damage from it. So the fact that I actually did it, I went into starvation mode and the body protects itself doesn't.

[55:47]
But what I was saying is the starvation expert that now I have a paper published in the New England Journal Medicine with them, which I'm pretty proud of. But he he didn't believe me. So he put me on an IV and right away the phosphate levels reacted and I almost went into shock. So I almost actually did die when they refit fed me. So his papers called the refeeding syndrome. They say, like after World War Two when they rescued the from the from the camps, the Jews and everybody was starving in the camps.

[56:14]
And a lot of soldiers gave them like candy bars and stuff. And all of a sudden their systems went into shock and they died from not being refed the right way.

[56:22]
So what is the correct way to feed someone if they haven't eaten? You have to slowly bring them back so that you don't have. What happened to me was this phosphate levels go all crazy. So very small amounts of food.

[56:33]
Yeah. But then two days later, somebody sent me a trunk from Harrods full of food and loaded like a frybread. And I was giving it to all the nurses and doctors because I knew I should eat it and I was trying to do it right then. Like in the middle of the night, I woke up and had like a bag of potato chips and then a bagel. And I was right. It was like the most. I also didn't go to the bathroom for a month and a half.

[56:59]
But think about that.

[57:02]
So how long does it take you to recover from one of these things? That one I feel like a never fully recovered from, but like so. And I wouldn't recommend anybody does that like those like super, super long with no food. But but by the way.

[57:16]
So you don't think you ever come into my body always goes like this now. It's always confused. When I like train, I go up, down really quick, really easy.

[57:26]
And it was since that everybody freaked out because wanted to be. Yeah I feel like that, you know, but there's no way to prove that.

[57:32]
But that's a common thing though with people cut wait for fights. Really. Yeah. They get to a certain point when they have kidney failure and. Yeah. Yeah. And then that's exactly that's what happened to me.

[57:43]
And I keep having problems with my kidneys. Yes. Yeah, yeah. And I have a spot, my kidney right now. Mm hmm. Yeah.

[57:51]
Yeah, yeah. That's, that's a real common one with guys. Daniel Cormier I actually had to drop out of the Olympics because that I didn't know that his kidneys failed.

[58:01]
Yeah.

[58:01]
Kidney failure is a big one with fighter's kidney stones, too, for a lot of guys who come late. So, yeah, that was probably, in your opinion, the one that damaged you the most. Or left the most residual, so the most difficult one was the ice. By far, the the ice was a monster and the reason why was because and now there's also something great about it. So it was a warm November. So the air coming through was like, you know, it happened to be a 68 degree, three day spread, which led to the ice cube dripping the cold on me.

[58:36]
And it's radiating this way. But I'm also standing up in one spot completely still. And you can't sleep because if you fall asleep in the presence of ice, you get frostbite. You have to cut your skin off. Right. So I'm staying completely awake the entire time. And it's a difficult situation on our 55. Exactly. Our look back at all of it. My friends knew my eyes just go out and I'm now hallucinating like you could never, ever know.

[59:03]
Hallucinogenic drug will ever give you those kind of hallucinations.

[59:07]
And what was it? First of all, it's amazing, but it's also when it goes into that nightmare part, it's scary, but there's also that amazing part of it. And if you have people are after that stunt now, whenever I hallucinate on stunts, I have friends there that I say I'm going to start hallucinating, just talk me through it. But so here's when I started realizing that I was hallucinating because you don't know when you are right.

[59:32]
And by the way, that one stunt than I ever did was sleep deprivation. If you remind me, I'll explain that whole thing. But I'll forget. But so so what happens is when I started realizing it is I need to know like what time it is because I'm done at 10:00 p.m. because it was life on ABC. So I'm like, I need to know how much longer I got to go through this because it's good stuff. So it's there, by the way.

[59:54]
And my doorman would come in like news or whatever.

[59:58]
Fox News said David Blaine is not really the they did a special on it, an hour long special on Fox saying that I was never in the ice and I had a double of me that was in the ice. I'm switching up and down with burgers.

[01:00:13]
Fox News, Fox TV station. Yeah.

[01:00:16]
Yeah. So they did, but they did a one hour special that I was never in there.

[01:00:20]
So my dorm, how they get away with doing that, I don't know. I don't care. But listen to my dorm. My dorm man who comes to this is the funny father.

[01:00:27]
So my doorman that comes to see me, he he's he knows me so well. He was at Buried Alive and he's so nice. Right. So he comes to visit me in New York and he walks up to the ice and he sees me and he's looking at me all weird.

[01:00:42]
I wasn't hallucinating. So get me over then he leaves but I go back. I was like, what's up? He's like. Are you sure that that was you would nice, could that have been you had. Like, what do you mean? He's like, OK, well it's you know, so we go on that special airs now. He's convinced that it wasn't me and I, especially his.

[01:01:06]
Why you're saying no, no, no.

[01:01:07]
That's after he already thinks because he doesn't believe it. My friends, my best friends and I was buried alive. They didn't think I was really doing it. They thought it was a trick, right? So so he he asked me, he's like, there's was that really you? Because they said that you were a double of yourself and you were switching as like Eddie.

[01:01:29]
But you looked at me like how if I have a twin brother, like, where is that identical twin brother and why why would I switch off?

[01:01:38]
So anyway, so back to the back to the. But I get to 55 hours, some looking around and I need the time. So I go like this, like what time is it. And the guy goes. 402, yeah, so so far to I'm like, OK, that means we have like another six hours or whatever it is, right? By the way, my time estimations are so I'm like, OK, wait, I might have been to.

[01:02:06]
Wait, wait, wait, wait. And I'm in. It's hard. I'm like, things are moving, everything's weird. Spiders walking up. People are like sitting in the ice and waiting, waiting. Voices are talking to me as I'm talking back to. Right.

[01:02:21]
But I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

[01:02:23]
And I wait for like a few hours before I ask anybody the time again. And I see somebody and I'm like. And the guy and the guy goes. Four oh three oh, no. And that's when it all crashed out, it was like when that when that connection and then the hallucinations were just rampant and my eyes were all crazy. When the drill was when the chainsaw was coming through, I tried to grab it.

[01:02:52]
Yeah. So I see. Look at that. Oh, God. But OK.

[01:02:57]
But but now that I've learned that sleep deprivation is one of the most amazing ways, if it's controlled to go to another place, it's like that.

[01:03:09]
But but I want to get to that. But before we get to that, like while you're in there, what are you doing to occupy your mind?

[01:03:16]
Like, how are you?

[01:03:17]
Did you have were using meditation?

[01:03:20]
Were you just thinking we just winging it like so OK, so for some of them what I do a big first of all. Yeah. A lot of things you get to your free time to think like there's no phones, no distractions aside from the physical. But but the one thing that I use with everything is kind of like a breakdown of numbers. I'm like, OK, this much I have to get to this point. Then when I get to this point, even when I run on a treadmill, I'm like, OK, I have to get to this point, which means let me get to the halfway point.

[01:03:47]
I'll consider that when I'm holding my breath, I do the same thing like, OK, I need to get to 15 minutes, so let me get to seven and I'll start at seven. Then at seven I'm like, OK, I'm at seven left. I have to get to another three and a half and three and a half. And then what I always do is whenever I'm training, I always go past it. So it's the same thing.

[01:04:03]
So like when I'm running a treadmill, I'm like, if I have to do, let's say, like, you know, three point, whatever it is I set, that is my target. But then I always go like another half a mile past it because I won't I can't quit before because then you'll be in the mindset that, OK, I can stop before. So like anything that I do, I use numbers to get there, I get halfway and then I push the goal further every single time, no matter what.

[01:04:26]
Hmm. Which is so it's a mathematical system, erotic.

[01:04:29]
So you don't necessarily have any sort of meditative techniques. You're just concentrating on the numbers.

[01:04:35]
Meditation for breath holding all the time. Right. Every time I do a breath, not on the end.

[01:04:40]
Now the ice was kind of there is like a breathing thing and I didn't really know much about it back then, but I was like more like fighting it.

[01:04:47]
Like, what is it like on your ankles or your knees and your everything swells up like a dream really bad and all that stuff. And the pain is excruciating and unbearable.

[01:04:55]
But yet, I mean, you're waiting and you didn't have any residual effects of that. Just my ankles and legs were really swollen just for a few days or so longer than that, but. Yeah.

[01:05:06]
Yeah. Now, has anybody ever tried to break that? Uh, I don't know. I hope not. Not because I don't care about how. I just don't anybody hurt themselves.

[01:05:15]
But I would imagine, like someone does something so high profile, like you did, that that people would be like, I'm going to try that. I mean, I think it's too weird.

[01:05:23]
So people aren't really like, oh, I want to do that.

[01:05:26]
There's billions of people, I would imagine that someone would step in and try to emulate. That obviously was.

[01:05:31]
I pray not. And that's why I pray my daughter never becomes a magician, even though she's so amazing at it. Because if she started doing these things, I like if she's going to bump any of like I have a heart attack, you know, that's the problem with being a parent, right?

[01:05:44]
Yeah.

[01:05:45]
The things that make you amazing are your ability to overcome adversity and then you shelter your children to adversity. You know, it's all my favorite people are all they all came from a very tumultuous childhood. They all came from, like, turmoil. And no one wants that for their child. You want to protect your children?

[01:06:03]
Yeah. Yeah, it's very weird. So what are the ones have you done where like. While you were doing it, you were thinking, what the fuck have I done? Because you admitted there was one that don't don't pull this one up, don't pull this off. It was called the dive of death and I started to get cocky.

[01:06:31]
I didn't like the thing in London. I didn't like the water tank then. So I started to get too cocky. Right. I didn't have time and ABC on the show really quick. I was like, OK, I'm going to go upside down for 60 hours, three days, whatever. Right. I was going to be upside down. And then and then some guy was in a parachute upside down on a tree in Italy and he was in the hospital because he was three days upside down in the tree.

[01:06:56]
And I was trying to speak to him. He was like not I didn't want to talk at all. And then they were like, it's his situation's really bad. So kind of like set the tone before I did the situation really bad, like from being upside down for that long. What happened to him? I think the blood I think I think it does. I don't know, because he didn't I didn't get to ask. They wouldn't tell me, but he wouldn't also engage in it was bad that I know it was like in the news it was bad.

[01:07:25]
I don't know what the permanent repercussions, but so when I did this thing upside down in New York, I didn't practice it. I thought I could just wing it. My stunt guy who taught me to jump off the pole, he's like, you can never, ever just go wing something and not dial it in and rehearse and figure it out. You can't just go do it. It's you can't hope for. And that was the first one ever and last one that I was like, OK, let me just hope that I can do this.

[01:07:50]
As soon as I went upside down, remember I said you could never prepare for certain things. Yeah, I had that catheter hooked up in the first time I peed. It just went upside down all over me. So this way. And I was like, I'm done.

[01:08:01]
So the whole stunt with that over there, that was like that was a great learning lesson because I learned you never just dial it, though.

[01:08:08]
Did you make it through that one? Yes, but it was terrible. It was a garbage. Yes. But you were asking me, like, what things? So that was one that was like, oh yeah.

[01:08:17]
But all of the others, they were amazing. The team that working with the best people, all of it. And this one is the most amazing. Like I have a team that's the one you're doing right now. I have the most amazing. I've never been able to have a team like this.

[01:08:33]
FALOON one. Yes. OK, explain this. OK, so I went to YouTube with crazy idea who, by the way, this is YouTube and they've been a blessing beyond beyond.

[01:08:44]
So I'm like, OK, here's what I want to do. Like, I want to grab a bunch of balloons and go floating up into the sky and disappear like, OK, great, OK, sure.

[01:08:52]
So now I need it to. This is all hypothetical. I'm not like a sky diver like that has a thousand or 10000 or 20000 jumps. I'm not a balloon pilot. I have no experience in any of this stuff. I just know that I want to do this and I've wanted to do it forever. But I, I had drawings of it made fifteen years ago, but now you have to get for real.

[01:09:12]
So there is a guy that flies, balloons and there's a guy like Long Chair Larry that went up on balloons with like a lawn chair and a bunch of beer. That was his balance. And he like popped balloons with the guy. So there are examples. So it's not like a complete hypothetical.

[01:09:27]
This one has like, OK, so what if I could take the balloons, that idea and just have the innocent image of a kid? Like we all dream of just holding the balloons and drifting up and into the sky here, see?

[01:09:41]
What's that? What's that one from their website. From whose website is that, Jamie? Right. So that's that's my belief is that up there? Yeah, we yeah, we did. We did short flights, not big in public. We kept it small.

[01:09:59]
Can I show these to Jamie? No, I don't know. Yeah. To him.

[01:10:06]
And I can show. Sean can show. I'm not sure. And don't wait. That's my balloons. Yeah. Oh, well, that's fine.

[01:10:13]
But that's that's the end of him doing it right.

[01:10:16]
So this is. But I think maybe maybe not. And but anyway. So, so OK. So it starts with just the idea of that. But now I have to go get a hot air balloon pilot license.

[01:10:30]
So I go meet with the best hot air balloon pilot, instructor and also flyer.

[01:10:35]
But isn't that the different situation than a hot air balloon? Because you don't have the ability to control. You have to first get your hot air balloon pilot license, so you have to learn how to fly. And Orlando Bloom, which is amazing. It's like so and then you have to take that written test. And I don't have time because I'm trying to do so much.

[01:10:51]
So I have to cram studied the whole written test in eight hours with a guy helping me. I study the whole thing, went to the airport, took the test, got that. Then you need to go get your gas or Strix and lift it. Which means because and very few people even ever bothered to do this because who's flying hydrogen or helium nowadays? So I went and met this guy, Burt Padel, who's the best gas balloonist in the world.

[01:11:14]
He's the one that built around the world in 80 days. He's built every balloon that's done the longest flights. And you fly now a hot air balloon.

[01:11:21]
You're like, right, you have to control it.

[01:11:24]
And it's helium and hydrogen. You're just part of the wind. You're literally just floating away. And it'll keep going up to 84000 feet until they pop there like you are just floating.

[01:11:38]
Like, I can't explain that feeling of floating anyway. So I had to go learn how to fly and land hydrogen balloons and use hydrogen because helium is more expensive and stuff like that. Now we have to go test the whole rig. So now at the same time, I have to also try to get as close to 500 jumps out of an airplane because I need to be really comfortable in the air. I have to jump out and land. I mean, and safety.

[01:12:04]
He's right. And when you're up at 25 plus thousand feet, you don't know where you are.

[01:12:09]
Right. So, yeah. So now and by the way, the video, did you see the video I made for you? You didn't see it? No. You made a video for me. Yeah.

[01:12:19]
Because when you did the thing post and imposes like he's not real and you were defending me, I was like not although I made a video, I sent it to Matt, I texted him.

[01:12:30]
I didn't get a video. He didn't show the video.

[01:12:32]
No, although I may do this video. So this is me yelling from the plane. And by the way, this is after the wingsuit guys jump out of the airplane. So remember, I'm also crushing lots of jumps really fast.

[01:12:44]
This one, I ran into a fence and almost killed myself. And Luke, who's the best in the world that has 25000 more jumps, jump from 25000 feet without a parachute and landed in a net. I saw. Yeah. So he's a guy coaching me. So he's the one filming this. And he landed at the state troopers patrol thing because we were so far lost and I ended up trying to make it back, almost hitting the trees really, really close and then crashing into a fence.

[01:13:11]
My legs are all bloodied up, ripped through the thing, flipped over land. And I was fine. I was recently I was like, and the reason why is because I was making this video a complete true. But I'm going to say that to make the video, I had to wait till the wingsuit started playing because their last. Right. But that means and by the way, the conditions, you'll see what they were like in a second.

[01:13:32]
So the plane's moving really, really far away. Right, because it's still going that means the drop zone is way over there. And I made the video and it was longer than I said it was going to be. And then when we jumped, we're like lost in the clouds and I see the only hole. So I fly through the hole. And now because I flew through that hole were so far away from everything.

[01:13:53]
And I should have followed Luke and went to the state patrol thing. But I was like, no, I'm going to make it just back. And but so here's the video I gave you, though.

[01:14:01]
Can we play it for other people? Why once you airdrop a dÃ©jame? Oh, yeah. OK, so we. Air drop, isn't that funny, though? It's pretty wild, but you don't see bummed out that I didn't get this before.

[01:14:19]
Oh well yeah. So I was going to like, posted or something. I asked them if I should, and it's like, well, wait, because maybe you'll just do the show. So I think that's why he didn't maybe. Or something. Like what. I don't know. Hello. Maybe he got lost in the email or something, it might have gotten to one of those that the email dumps get pretty big sometimes. The point where I can't keep up is that young James, young Jamie, young James.

[01:14:51]
OK, so that's that one. But then I'm going to show you the rest of the shot. But you might have to scroll through it to get to it. But I show you. But by the way, it's the most amazing thing. I'll show you the rest of that shot and then you'll see where he landed and where I landed. So I'm going to send you first the pretty version of it. You guys can, like, cut through or whatever.

[01:15:11]
Sure. OK, yeah. So I'm going to edit. I'm going to just send you like the full and then go look.

[01:15:17]
So here's another one. When is this one supposed to be in two weeks, two weeks? And do you have to take into consideration the wind, the like with the current?

[01:15:31]
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. And that's why we can't, like, confirm a location, because we determine everything. So even though now, like, you know, almost 400 jumps, the wind still decide where you go here.

[01:15:44]
So. All right, here we go. Did you get that other way? I've only got one. OK, so what makes you want me to play? Well, that's the first one so I can come back short.

[01:15:56]
OK. OK, check this out. The. Feel a little bit about what I've been through, so I'll look first at the because that my have. Oh, Jesus Christ. Okay, but so you see the clouds. Now, hold on. This one's going to come. So you're hanging on to a plane. How? Oh, hi there. No, that was just I 13000.

[01:16:29]
Oh, nothing. No, but I want to know that I want to 25. I know. I remember you tell me. Yeah.

[01:16:34]
Yeah. But still the still 13000 feet up there hanging on to a plane. Jump off.

[01:16:40]
Maybe it's another one. Maybe it's this one.

[01:16:43]
It's hilarious that you're like, oh, it's only 13000 feet hanging on to the wing of a plane that I let go on video.

[01:16:52]
I don't need to see that. I can. I can't play here, though. Right. And show you like this. We have to air because it's going to drop is better because of first going slow.

[01:17:01]
I just want to send this one that shows like how spectacular. But I could just say that was pretty spectacular. Explains what's going on. So hold on now which one.

[01:17:09]
Because there's three young James, the MacBook Pro joining me, but there's three MBP doesn't matter is click one and it should work.

[01:17:17]
Now, when you decide to do something like this, do you get it? Inspiration and then you consult people to see if it's feasible, like, well, so so that's why I was lucky.

[01:17:29]
So the thing is, I come up with the idea and then I find a guy. His name is Jonathan Trappe. He's the one that tried to cross the Atlantic with helium for balloons. And but I mean, he has it's like a full system. He is a Basque. So it's like a real balloon, like a hot air balloon system with. So nobody's ever done it where they just float, where their bodies are the basket, you know.

[01:17:50]
I mean, so he had the whole system and then he came and tested out and I was like, could I go try it like this? And he's like, no, we're not ready. You'll kill yourself or whatever. You're hanging on to the rope.

[01:17:59]
Yeah, but I'm going to make sure that I'm not going to have a parachute on. And I'm going to I'll I'll have a system. So I'm completely secure. So I'm not going to fall off, but I'm not going to wear the parachute because I don't want to be I want it to look like a kid. Just holding on to balloons like that. Visual is the important part. So the parachutes up in the balloons.

[01:18:19]
But once I get above, like a thousand feet or so, I'm going to put the parachute on air.

[01:18:26]
So you going to put the parachute on when you're up there? Yeah. And then I want to see if how high I can go. See, that's the thing. You can go ball, so the highest thing on earth is Mount Everest, right? So that's kind of my goal. But I have to be careful, because if you if you're if you don't come back down, you're dead. So if you can't get down from there, that's that zone is like the death zone.

[01:18:56]
So from like 25000 to 30000 is very, very dangerous. You can blackout like this. So I'm going to do a couple more hypoxic tests and see if I'm right. I'll have emergency stuff up there like oxygen if I need it.

[01:19:09]
But I don't want floating around with you up there in the balloons.

[01:19:12]
Yeah, we have like the police dude, your loved ones panic when you start plotting things like this. My daughter asks question, how old is she? Nine. And she has great questions. And the plate the tail number of the plate is for me and her. So it's n for no but nine for her age, 47 for my age, and then DB for me and her both this and David Blaine. But which is the balloon that has I made.

[01:19:41]
This has to be a registered aircraft. So we had to get it registered, we had to fly it up, we had to prove that it's completely safe, we had to land it with nobody on it. So the body one time that I went wasn't me. It was sand that weighed exactly what I weighed. We had to remote dump the sand. We had to use squibs to promote pop the balloons, fly it over. And this is at twenty two thousand feet and fly.

[01:20:04]
What is what is control. But is it radio. Yeah exactly. And I, I have the whole team helping me that did like Alan Eustace when he jumped and Felix Baumgartner when he jumped from the edge of space. So we have Don De the best meteorologists.

[01:20:17]
They have to wait who before you get on it's precision.

[01:20:22]
And then so we had to fly it all the way up to twenty two thousand feet is proof that this aircraft is actually completely doable. And then remote land exactly where they predicted we were going to land that. And we've done that multiple times.

[01:20:35]
We've flown it, we've deployed the the the imitation, I've flown massive amount of time involved in constructing one of these things and orchestrating it time and team and team is everything.

[01:20:49]
So it'd be like you when you have like the best trainers if you had like your five best in the world, like tweaking you before fights like that.

[01:20:58]
So when when you plan on doing something like this, did you bring this up to to these folks? These are the first people, the people that you're doing it with. These are the people that you brought it up to the first time. Yeah. Nobody said, get the fuck out of here with this now.

[01:21:11]
Went straight to YouTube. And I was like, I have seen these guys and they hesitated.

[01:21:16]
All No, they're they're amazing. That was crazy. That's one of them. Right. It is also crazy because it is just a hypothetical idea. That's insane. That's true. And they did let me like but there were stages I had to prove each step side to prove that No. One, the balloon is doable. Number two, I'm not going to hopefully kill myself. Number three, I can actually get the dough in then for the skydives, by the way, because I had to get five hundred jumps really quick.

[01:21:42]
And this is all during the last year. Right. So insurance wouldn't cover that. I mean, they would cover it, but it's not affordable. So I had to do five, almost 5400 jumps or so with no insurance, you know, so that's a whole separate thing that's not related. So I had to go do them from my own as fun and do everything through my own. You see, this is crazy. It's all nuts because and because he think of skiting, think like, oh, you have the best go.

[01:22:09]
It's fine.

[01:22:09]
But they're still like when you're trying to do fifteen jumps a day, it's like you can do what I did, which is try to avoid hitting an airplane in a hangar and turn to low income wacking down the line.

[01:22:21]
Did you come up with this idea? Oh, I mean, I think it was like inspired when I was a kid. I think like the idea of, like the little boy drifting balloons. I think it was like but I never really thought of it as a reality. But then fifteen years ago or so, I had drawings made of it. So I started having I'll show you the drawings. I can't open it on there.

[01:22:41]
So when did you put it into motion like it was never even possible until YouTube said, OK, well back this because the idea is like all of my other stunts, there's like the budget pretty very you know, you couldn't afford to do something like this.

[01:22:55]
This is to build test flight, build an actual aircraft, fly it, land it, get all the jumps, learn how to do everything, get all the skill set, have this. So this is but that's the first drawing.

[01:23:07]
Oh wow. Yeah. So you drew this when you were. I didn't draw someone else did. Yeah. Mark Stutzman's an amazing artist that did my poster for this thing which I'll so so I send this to Jamie. Yeah. It's not working but you can draw try here. Just not working. And I was somewhere it was happening.

[01:23:23]
I was trying to do it. I can but maybe the picture will go, oh OK. If not I can restart the phone and maybe it'll work. Was it shown up for you, Jamie? No, right, let me restart the phone is a lot of OK announces it's waiting. There's like so many MacBook pros, yeah, yeah, there's three went yeah, someone went through okay then I also sent. Oh but wait so I also show you the poster that I had made, which was okay.

[01:23:54]
So you come to YouTube, powerful YouTube, they come up with this, I mean, they just this idea just that's the original, but this is the latest one.

[01:24:04]
So you send that one Tim to. I'll send it to. It's coming through right now, supposedly. I think it's like I have to accept them for some reason, it doesn't just go. Is it showing up for you? No, I think I should restart the phone because those videos, too, I want to send their guys. OK, how did you get it together? Which one did you press?

[01:24:30]
I don't know. There's so many of them. It doesn't make any sense. Your phone is being monitored by the government.

[01:24:36]
They're calling all that one. Hold on. I want to try to send this video so I could explain making your video, if that's possible. But when you oh, now it's preparing it so beautiful. Now, it's going to have it coming right now. Because it says it's converting, so it might be coming, we're waiting for an except on this, so, OK, as soon as I get that.

[01:25:03]
So you bring this to YouTube.

[01:25:06]
How long ago was it? Uh. A year and a half ago or something, they say, yeah, let's do it, we're fucking crazy. Yeah, and also it's probably going to have 100 million people watch it.

[01:25:19]
So it seems like I don't know. I don't know about that. Oh, I do. Yeah. I don't know, you know, float around in a fucking balloon. A lot of people don't watch it and I don't know if that's true.

[01:25:28]
Oh, I'll bet on it. But this one by far is my favorite that I've ever done. It's the most visual of the most colorful. It's it's the first one that I've ever done where my friends are like, I want to do that.

[01:25:41]
They're not like, why do you do that? You know, whatever you're holding up.

[01:25:45]
But, you know, all the other things that do people are like like that's it's great that you're doing it, but that's crazy or why are you doing it?

[01:25:51]
This one, they're like, I want to ride the balloons because it's a childhood dream. Yeah. Yeah. Like so it'll be like that. Wow. That's pretty cool. So it'll look just like that. And how is it, are you harnessed.

[01:26:05]
It's like yeah it'll be like a little thing that connects it. My wrist, which like the way the Israelis have it and then it has a connected to your body, your torso somehow.

[01:26:15]
Yeah. It'll be connected some more crotch. Yeah. Hopefully it's or something. Yeah. Because when you get up to like minus you know, twenty degrees or whatever you'll be non-functional up there so. Right. You can't just rely.

[01:26:29]
Well you can't really rely on your hand.

[01:26:31]
No, no, no, no no no. I was, I if I had to do this up to like, you know, two to 3000 feet I could because was holding on. Yeah, yeah. You can ascend. You can also do what you know, just put something around your foot like the the wires could come down OK.

[01:26:45]
So something around your foot would just it takes all the way to help. Yes. It's doable. Right.

[01:26:50]
And then in the nation can you actually hang though like I mean it's really hard to hang more than a couple of minutes. It's hard to hang for more than a minute. I think like the record is like two minutes. But what would you say with one hand?

[01:27:04]
Oh, but this has to look, the whole this has to look like the one hand the advantage of a person front.

[01:27:09]
Yes. To be exact. So you'd have to have some freaky forearms. Popeye.

[01:27:13]
Yeah. So I'll have assistants Bill but so I won't have a parachute or any of that stuff that'll be above me. So it'll look really clean, but I'll be supported now if there is a balloon failure or something like that, obviously I'm in trouble obviously. But once I get the parachute on, once I get to 5000 feet, then we know, OK, he's not going to die. He has a parachute on. I can get away. And now the big challenge is how high can you go?

[01:27:40]
Oh, so once you get how are you going to know? Do you have an altimeter on the.

[01:27:46]
I'll have an altimeter but I'm also going to have a communication. OK, for everything. OK, I'm going to have cameras with me.

[01:27:54]
Are you using a watch for the altimeter or like what do you use. I'm using this one called the Kunu right now, but it's OK. Sure. No, but I was I've been jumping with some toes and things just to check how accurate there aren't. They're not bad. They're like off by like two hundred feet or something like that. But on the landing, you don't want to be off, you know, especially if you're like me. You don't even you only have 400 jumps.

[01:28:16]
Not even. Right. Right. So and you're landing in dicey areas because you don't know where you are.

[01:28:21]
Right. So gust of wind can throw you hear there. Yeah.

[01:28:24]
Anything. But you also have to like, not hit a power line or a building or an obstacle or anything wherever you are. Right. If you if you come down into a mountain, you're going to whack into that. It looks flat from here. But if you didn't adjust, you're going to come in hard and that's it. Yeah, right. If you hit a power line, you're dead. So, yeah, those types of things we have to like.

[01:28:43]
And which is why when I'm controlling the balloons and going up and up and up and up and up.

[01:28:51]
I'm going to hopefully be five, hopefully scaring the shit out of me already, so at 5000 feet, you how do you get the parachute?

[01:29:00]
It's up there and the balloons and I'm going to pull it down. It's on like a fishing wire thing. I pull it down and then I put it on. That's only like really difficult things to be done as you've practiced that that aspect of it. And that's like really scary to everybody around. Oh, like, they're asking me, why won't I just wear the thing like everybody. Yeah. They're like, you have to wear it and you don't want to wear it.

[01:29:24]
My brother's really obsessed with my daughter's. New question is how come you're not wearing the parachute? But but I'm telling her it's fine. But you haven't. Have you done this transition yet where you go from floating to putting the parachute on? No, that'll be done live the first time. Oh, jeez, this whole thing will be done the first time live.

[01:29:43]
And I've never done it. And I've done all of the elements of it. So I've done the jumps. I've done the balloon flights, I've flown the rig. But I've never put it all together.

[01:29:52]
That's all going to happen for the first time in my life. I've got to go.

[01:29:59]
And so once you get the vest on, once you get the parachute on, then the goal is to see how high you can get up. Yeah.

[01:30:06]
And once you get part that I'm obsessed with, when you get to the area of 30000 plus feet, not only can't cross there, I mean, I just want to get the goal is if I get up to like 20, 5000 feet, I'm excited, OK? Because that's where the ice I want to disappear. Like, I actually want the visual to be that I disappear into the sky.

[01:30:28]
OK, so you get up to 25, but I'm not going to kill myself doing it, so not I won't.

[01:30:33]
OK, I believe you. But this one is different than I'm going to have these two things.

[01:30:37]
By the way, you can't send the O2 pulse oximeter signals down so they won't know from hypoxic. But I'm going to have the O2 monitors in my pocket. I'm going to put them on. I'm going to show them to the camera.

[01:30:48]
They can still communicate with you. Get through. Now, if they can't, that's a big issue of communication fails. Then this is for me.

[01:30:55]
Communication is done through what RF this this incredible guy that builds all of the communication for every skydiving stunt movie.

[01:31:04]
So he's the same way little plane can communicate with the ground. Yeah.

[01:31:08]
Yeah, it's it's something. Yeah.

[01:31:10]
And I have I have a transponder up. I have everything. So the plane's visible. Everybody knows. Ram, we're clearing everything with the FAA, the ATC. So everything is going to be, you know, completely organized as it needs to be. We have a wind path in every location that we're going to possibly do this in. Of course, New York is a dream and there's some other dreams that we have. So, you know, this is still we have a couple of key points that we're dreaming about doing this.

[01:31:36]
And depending on wind and weather, that's where we'll do it.

[01:31:39]
And how do you get how do you descend? Just let go some, just the least. So, yeah, so you're going to skydive at twenty five thousand feet. Yeah.

[01:31:51]
By the way, when I did when I did the I told you when I did that test, when I went up to 20, almost 20, 24, 24/7 or whatever, I had the the helmet on. The first breath I took, the entire thing was ice right away. So and I was flying down looking through like a little hole in the helmet.

[01:32:08]
I couldn't see Jesus Christ. And so. When you land, you have to land, I mean, you're from 25000 feet, you have to make sure that you're conscious, you have to make sure that you can see. That's right.

[01:32:24]
But usually, by the way, even if you are hypoxic and you're dropping, you clear up at like 10000 feet. So, Luke, ACoNs, the who you what? He did a jump once where he was jumping with Felix Baumgartner, who he trained and he was out of he was hypoxic. He was blacked out. But when he got to about 9000 feet or so, he woke up and then from. Yeah, but from 9000 feet down, you have, you know, 40 seconds to figure out where you are and what you're doing, OK?

[01:32:55]
It seems it still seems fucking terrifying.

[01:33:00]
And so then you're floating down and you have to find a good spot to land. And when are you going to do this?

[01:33:08]
Like, what's the official launch date?

[01:33:10]
Is it August 31, 100 percent, depending on winds, depending on when. So if the winds are fucked on August 31st.

[01:33:15]
Yeah, exactly. And that's the other thing. YouTube's been amazing. There it is. David Blaine, Ascencion, YouTube originals, August 31st. Yeah, that's basically what I love, that YouTube stepped up to do this. Yeah, it is amazing. It is amazing. Look at you floating above the cloud in that image and that's literally what you're going to be doing.

[01:33:33]
Yeah, that's so fucked up. But also, the thing about this one, aside from like the technical part of it is like the visual on it so far is my favorite one.

[01:33:45]
Yeah. It's light up like when they did it. Yeah. But when I, but when I look at the balloons I become like giddy like in all these adults are working and we're all like laughing because they're like little, we're like kids, you know, it's like it's iconic.

[01:33:59]
It's something that every kid has kind of thought of. Yeah. Yeah. Grabbing a balloon and lighting like Mary Poppins. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow.

[01:34:07]
And that was my daughter's nickname when she was growing up. We called Mary the real Mary Poppins. If she was a real very pop as we put a balloon up and we'd always watch it and dream and talk about where it goes and stuff like that, what is it like for her to when you discuss things he sees?

[01:34:24]
So I run ideas by her. She's amazing. Yeah. She's amused by the way, the reason there's pink balloons and this because I was showing her all the balloons, she says they're going to be pink. And I was like, of course there's going to be fake.

[01:34:35]
And now there's fake legs. Wow.

[01:34:40]
Now you have you been doing live shows this whole time or are you able to with not D'Errico but now right up to code I was doing live and I haven't been promoting that or anything, but it's like my favorite thing because I've been working on the live show for.

[01:34:56]
20 some years, and I've never done one until like the last few years, like started like three years ago, the first time I did that, which is crazy, right?

[01:35:07]
Yeah, but I finally felt like I had the right material to make a good show. And the show is so it's so it's like I open it with the mouth going. So the first thing is I like it, but I bring people up. So it's also comical. It's like funny, like joking around and stuff that you see people like that, you know, when you say Malzone you actually saw your mouth.

[01:35:28]
Yeah. Yeah. And you do that how many nights a week one know.

[01:35:32]
So I would do two days on, one day off. But every day of a show means you can't eat for 36 hours before the show because I also have to put a gallon of water in my stomach. I have to put a cup of kerosene. But now I don't swallow the kerosene. I put it in my mouth and spit it so I don't swallow. But on Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel, I drank this stuff and it's like, really, really.

[01:35:52]
That's how the guy died, how jolly that told do it.

[01:35:55]
So now I just put it in the mouth, spit it. But see I and then I do the frogs in the stomach. I put the hanger all the way down the throat to fetch somebody's ring.

[01:36:03]
I, I do the breath, I do the breath.

[01:36:07]
Hold every single night and and then and then I push and then I have them push an ice pick through my arm every night which is like you don't want to hit a brachial you know anything or. Yeah. Or an artery or anything.

[01:36:20]
So but I, and I let them choose a spot. By the way, I also brought the ice pick if you do do want to, because I know that, you know, it's real.

[01:36:27]
But I said, oh, I believe it's real, but I still want to see it. I know I haven't done it since my tour, really itching to do it. I mean, I need you to do it.

[01:36:37]
I'd like you to do it just to see that it is like pretty straightforward. Oh, I believe it's straightforward, but I brought one with me and I got the alcohol from there.

[01:36:44]
So here is that girl. Girl. So you're stitching your mouth. Exactly.

[01:36:51]
But so see, so what I was able to do with the state show is I bring people up on stage and I have the cameras at the big screen. So you see people reacting to this stuff. So it's the magic plus the reaction. So you get that whole and this girl's really into it.

[01:37:04]
Look at her. So you do this all the time, the stitching the mouth shut, I would imagine you would accumulate some scar tissue.

[01:37:13]
Now, that one's easy, but this one's legit. This one. I used to do it through the hand. This is the guy with this, like I used to do through the hand. And I developed so much scar tissue that like when I move my fingers a certain way, I get a shooting pain. So I stopped doing the hands and I switch to here.

[01:37:27]
That makes sense. I would I would imagine that would really fuck your hands up.

[01:37:31]
Oh, that's the first. So wait, but so I might have to sit next to you or something.

[01:37:40]
Do you want me to do this to you? Is this what's going on here. Yeah. I can come over to your side. OK. OK, ok. All right. But wait, don't you need the ar. You can put those on.

[01:37:49]
I'll just come walk over. I take that thing off. You can if you like. We'll both be basically talking to the same.

[01:38:00]
No but we can do it sitting. Yeah but can you put those on top. Yeah. OK. Gymnast's my work, OK, Jamul, turn this, you know, crank this thing over the air, so so choose where we want the left or the right, let's do the right since it's right next to me.

[01:38:19]
OK, do you want them to come in and see it as well. No. Good enough. OK, so now this is not a new icepick and usually I do it with new ones, which means this isn't as sharp as it needs to be. So it means that push is going to be a little more difficult, I guess.

[01:38:35]
Why do you like to do this? You seems to be or are these ones that you give us pure alcohol? Yes. Yes, I believe so. I mean, they're just the standard ones that you get. It's fine, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you want to make sure there's no Centinela?

[01:38:50]
Oh, no, I want to make sure that there is no Bacterin. Right. But I mean on the alcohol strip. Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Why do you enjoy this?

[01:38:58]
You seem you're not excited about this now. Well, first of all, it's amazing that you can actually do something like this, like it's nothing. So there's a guy named Mirin Daio. Can you pull up Miren Dio. You think so. Miren Dio. It's this guy. And nobody believed he was doing it for real and he would take ratepayer's and he would have them push right through the middle of his body, oh his lungs and everything he would show on all sides and then they would pull him out and he'd be perfectly fine and every doctor and saying, oh, you can't do that.

[01:39:28]
But so remember when Steve Irwin died, you know why he died? You know, because he pulled the stingray thing out of his heart, this thing, and he pulled it out. Right, crocodile.

[01:39:38]
So if he kept it in there, he would have lived right after that.

[01:39:41]
A 70 year old man was on his boat and a stingray jumped up out of the water, stung him in the heart, and then a stingray was gone. But I didn't even.

[01:39:50]
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I get that.

[01:39:53]
It's isn't that crazy. But the fact that you can actually do this is what's crazy. Like the body. Can you with your mind, you can override it. And then the thing is, he got so cocky, though, that he thought he could do anything. And then he ate one of these things.

[01:40:08]
He swallowed it, killed it internally and died. But see, he got really cocky because he was like, I could do anything that is fucking insane.

[01:40:17]
Is he going through his liver? He can go through anything. And that's what I'm saying. So the seven year old guy that got the stingray to it stabbed him in the heart instead of pulling it out, which it's like a corkscrew.

[01:40:29]
He waited till they were doctors to it beat out the other side and he was fine.

[01:40:35]
You say, wow. So instead of pulling it out, he waited until one happened, the doctors waited with the heart, they let it beat out the other side and they slowly let it come out. He went through his whole body. They if they would have pulled it, it's like a corkscrewed would rip him apart.

[01:40:51]
He would die. How long did it take for it to beat through it?

[01:40:54]
No, but I know that the doctors what they did is they let it go through.

[01:40:58]
Guy how many times this guy gets stabbed like that one, by the way, right there.

[01:41:07]
That's a safe place, that's like not an issue, but when you go through the lungs and stuff, it's crazy, it's crazy, but this is too much. So it's too like too fucking sword, man. But that's one thing.

[01:41:20]
That one. Listen, he's so but so what happened was he started to get too cocky. He started to think he was fine.

[01:41:29]
Oh, Jesus Christ. But but OK. But if you listen to the origin of this trick, that's not a trick. No, I know. But listen. OK, origin of this is as a kid, there's that trick where they do needle through arm. Yes. Right. And it's like the rubber, you know, the stuff and it sticks your skin together. Looks perfect. It looks like it's really through your arm. And then they like squeeze blood out of the thing.

[01:41:53]
They. Right. So I saw that. And then I was like, but maybe that's like actually doable. Like maybe that trick could really be done. So like the same exact trick, but for real. Right. So that's this, OK, because you take that OK? Like I said, it's going to be a little tricky to push through just because it's usually sharp and this time it's not as sharp.

[01:42:15]
How do you know where to do it? We're going to take there's no particular spot to hit in art. You know, you're going how do I know I'm not going to hit an artery that I know I can't kill you? But what if it was done?

[01:42:26]
So you want me just right here, anywhere? Sure. Where do you prefer? Wherever you look. Right there.

[01:42:32]
Wow. Sure. I don't know. But yeah. Do it there where you want. Do it where you wouldn't you say.

[01:42:36]
Well sure. Where do you like it to go through the bottom.

[01:42:40]
Like no I liked where you were going. Right. I mean that's, that's fine. But it's OK to go like through. Well what do you want me to do. Yeah. You're going to push through. OK, so hold on. You here keep like a straight path. OK, like that. No, it goes like that. I'd go straight through. Yeah. OK, ready. Slowly and go slow. You'll see that, yeah, see?

[01:43:11]
So it's hard to believe that it's real. We keep pushing going. Keep going. Wait, oh, hold on. Well, what happened? I hit a nerve. Oh, jeez, another spot. No, no, no, no, no. Come on, man, you got to spike your nerve. Yeah, but what if I fucked your arm up, man?

[01:43:36]
And then you can't hang from the balloon and then YouTube's mad at me.

[01:43:43]
OK, I got Jesus, bro.

[01:43:46]
OK, so, by the way, honest to God, I never go in this direction, which way to go, I always go this direction one inside the out. I'm just saying it's like that of all the times I did it, I've always gone this direct. You want me to go that direction?

[01:44:01]
I'm just telling you, I've never got better. No. So what's the difference? I'm just saying I've never done it this way. OK, so the groundbreakers. No, I'm saying it's nuts, but it's definitely not so nuts again. OK.

[01:44:12]
No, but from the bottom. Like this. Like that. Yeah, ok. And I go again and I would, I would try to go like a straight path through like right now I would go like lower and Im like just like point. Yeah. OK. Yeah I'd go like that and hold on. Wait, wait. Yeah, like that, like that, that's good. Yeah, we're on a clean path, we hit something, but it's fine now.

[01:44:44]
It's like I use the skin here and I push so you can see it come through. Push. That's it. See?

[01:44:51]
All righty.

[01:44:56]
Super unnecessary, but it does seem like a magic trick.

[01:45:02]
It definitely doesn't seem like a magic trick to hold on. There's blood vessels and everything. Yes.

[01:45:06]
There's no blood. Well, it's a very small hole in comparison to it now. It's a good. And there is blood on the other hole. OK, yeah.

[01:45:15]
That's because it's that you hit something and your body's healthy, so it's clotting out pretty quickly. Okay. I'm sure I put it out. Yeah. OK, here we go.

[01:45:25]
Slowly go. That's it. OK.

[01:45:40]
So here this is for you to keep, but I can't say I enjoyed that.

[01:45:48]
I was very uncomfortable. But what's weird to me more than anything is that you seem to enjoy it.

[01:45:56]
You enjoyed the freak out of it.

[01:45:58]
No, I like what I said. I like that you can override your body with your brain to do things that seem like they're not real.

[01:46:06]
Yeah, it doesn't seem, you know, it's real because of what you do to your body. But most people see all of the things they do and think it's a magic trick. Right. They think it's a trick, like, OK, it's a trick.

[01:46:16]
Like he's not holding his breath and you've done that thing with the sword when you've gone through your body. Yeah, but it was not very thick and it was through right here. I didn't go didn't go through the organs like this guy did.

[01:46:27]
No, but but I think you can I think obviously he did it right and swallowing this is what killed him.

[01:46:34]
So he got really he thought he could do anything. So he's like, I'm going to swallow this type of thing and then I'm going to bring it up. Swallowed it. And he couldn't bring it up.

[01:46:45]
And then he fell asleep and it ruptured his heart. When he woke up, they found him cold. Oh, boy. Internal bleeding. Jesus Christ.

[01:46:55]
That is the thing about these extreme feats, right. Is that you possibly might be pushing the boundaries of what's physically possible, which means you could die like Houdini. Like Houdini died from getting punched in the stomach. Yeah. How does a punch to the stomach kill you?

[01:47:08]
Well, so normally, like, I had Kimbo Slice punch me in the stomach. Did you really? Yeah. Ouch. Yeah.

[01:47:15]
And then I had him do it again and then I felt bad. I didn't want to make him keep doing it because it was, you know, because as you know, you can train to take a punch.

[01:47:23]
That's obviously. So I basically had my trainer, rich bread.

[01:47:27]
I throw heavy balls, kick me in the stomach, do everything. And I trained for a long like a year just to take a punch from anybody and oh yeah.

[01:47:37]
Kemba boom.

[01:47:39]
Oh and then I was like and then I said to him do it again. So and by the way I'm not even in top physical so I said do it again and then I, but I could, I obviously could have kept going so boom.

[01:47:50]
And I did that based on Houdini. Right. So but here's the thing. So Houdini would do this on stage every night. And it's a it's a great thing in the show. It's like, look, Bhabha every any ten strongest people knowing he's come upon you. And so and these kids think he's invisible. Invincible, right. Like like this is Houdini, man of Steel or whatever. So he's sleeping in his dressing room. These two college kids want kids, like watch out stronger than they punch Houdini and stomach really is asleep.

[01:48:18]
Yes. And as you know, that's dangerous because you don't have a wall up.

[01:48:22]
So he ruptured something, but he's a workaholic.

[01:48:25]
So the guy is in a lot of pain.

[01:48:27]
Whether he might maybe it wasn't related, maybe it's something different. Maybe he had, you know, who knows. Right. He's a lot of pain, but he wouldn't let the audience down so he wouldn't quit his show. So he did his show. And at the end of the show, he's upside down the water tank, everything else. When he shouldn't have been he should have been in the hospital. But instead he did the show that night, collapsed on the stage, was not from the water tank, but right after the water tank was rushed to a hospital and then died in the hospital.

[01:48:53]
And what was the diagnosis? What did he die from?

[01:48:55]
What was, you know, 1926 little voodoo? Yeah, they died from voodoo. Yeah.

[01:49:03]
Wow. So when you mean that, that's the thing about someone who does something that pushes it to the edge like that. I mean, when someone sees you hold your breath for twenty minutes, what's fascinating about is not just that it's hard to do, but that you might die. Yeah, right, yeah, yeah, or some people say, oh, what how's he doing? What's the trigger? You know, so there's all different interpretations.

[01:49:28]
But the worry the thing that thrills people. Yeah. Is like the you know. Well, yeah. The idea that something could go wrong. That's why everybody watched Evel Knievel, because he might like it on and he often did wipe out his bike. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:49:42]
What did this thrill of getting to that edge is very dangerous. Right, because you keep pushing.

[01:49:49]
There's a danger. But I still like if you rehearse and practice and put the best team and don't just do crazy things without like a plan, then I feel like the danger is like, sure, the danger is there. But I also rode my motorcycle here, which is also story and I've lost a lot of friends on bikes. Yeah, right.

[01:50:05]
So sure, I get what you're saying and I understand all that.

[01:50:09]
You seem to like thrill's. Well, I mean, I like adventures, like riding motorcycles. It was a adventure that is an adventure. Yeah, yeah. It's I mean, I look at people to do it every day and I go, that's a brave California.

[01:50:24]
You're allowed to like we've done. So that's that's kind of amazing in California.

[01:50:28]
Like, go ahead, give it a shot. Fuck it. You're here.

[01:50:32]
You know, how where do you see this? Do you have, like, a grand vision of your life in terms of, like these stunts that you do like do you have like some ultimate threshold that you'd like to get to?

[01:50:46]
Like, we have to take a break. I want to make sure that I'm OK. OK.

[01:50:51]
Oh, yeah. Yeah. We'll take a break. We'll be right back. All right. So we got to clean up your wound and it was fine. Yeah, you seem to enjoy it. You really do.

[01:51:03]
You were laughing while they were cleaning it up and checking it. And it's good.

[01:51:06]
We're good. It was just what was it? The blood. What was it that was bothering you? He's drinking all the water. Prepare for swallowing.

[01:51:16]
I just I just felt, you know, too much of a magic becoming real to magic.

[01:51:23]
How much water do you have to drink?

[01:51:25]
Oh, probably you do what you want to do, I will say.

[01:51:29]
And do you have to drink it at a certain speaks? I've seen people that can chug these. They just shove the whole thing down their face. It's almost like a magic chicken. It's all they can drink it.

[01:51:48]
Yeah, those guys are just like I had, like the guy that was the fastest work on it with me. But how many do you have to drink.

[01:51:57]
You've drank three so far. Yeah. Plus two out there but yeah. So five you have to drink eight total.

[01:52:05]
Do you need a bucket or anything to throw the frog up? Do we have a bucket ice bucket? That doesn't seem like enough fluid, though, bucket. Well, this American flag bucket in the back, that big one.

[01:52:23]
Oh, perfect. Oh, look at that. How convenient this poor frog has no idea he's a magical frog.

[01:52:30]
How do you know he's real? Hmm. He's real. Well, you don't know. It could be a magic trick.

[01:52:34]
Well, if it is, it's amazing to sell these to people that don't want biological frogs. That's a fucking life.

[01:52:44]
I mean, he's looking at me. He's moving around his bobbing his head. He's trying to get the fuck out.

[01:52:49]
He's making the thing with the throat. We're looking at trying to get out.

[01:52:53]
That's a real frog, kids, no doubt. When did you start doing this, the frog thing? I don't know. Was it overflows? There there's a guy called, there was a guy called the Human Aquarium. And so the thing about most of the acts that I'm doing, by the way, like night after night, usually the people that did them, it was like their one acts as one guy called the human aquarium. And he was the guy who could swallow frogs and bring them up.

[01:53:25]
But he would do it. You'd see him swallow them and then you'd see him bring them up. So it wasn't magical. It was like a skill set. I would usually what I do is I'd put them in my stomach, keep them in there for like two hours and then bring them up and freak you out. Right. And I'd have a gallon of water. My stomach's I have an aquarium. A baking soda gets rid of the acid, no food, 36 hours.

[01:53:48]
And then once I drink this, were at a gallon or four leaders just an hour ago, so. So did you not eat for 36 hours in preparation for this? Yes.

[01:54:00]
Well, that's a lot of not eating for poor frogs.

[01:54:05]
Worst moment of his life was poor little dude. Jamie, just in case you don't think he's real, he's real. Oh, there's more than one in there now.

[01:54:15]
That's just him. It's just an illusion.

[01:54:20]
I thought there was a little one in there. That's a decent sized frog, too, by the way, you wouldn't want to swallow frog that large. Mark Twain has a quote. He says, either live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse could happen for the rest of the day.

[01:54:39]
By the way, back to the James Nestor book, The one thing deep or something he talks about that's really amazing, which is one of my favorite parts. And there he talks about how Coral communicates. Can I read this thing? Sure. Yeah, sure. So he talks about it's one of my favorite things that he talks about. It's so amazing. So that's where. OK, so. I have, like a bunch of notes. What app you used to read from ebooks, just because you could keep all the books there and you highlight things with ebooks?

[01:55:21]
Yeah, of course I didn't know you can. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then keep all of your books here, right?

[01:55:27]
No, I do that on my phone, but I didn't know you could highlight.

[01:55:31]
I've rarely read on the phone to I usually use the Kindle.

[01:55:35]
Yeah. I don't, I only use this is the thing I like live by. So it's like ruined my life. But also also had it helped that somehow I guess some way and see I don't take any second to pull it up.

[01:55:49]
I just like the Kindle because it looks like paper, you know, the Paperwhite ones.

[01:55:54]
Yeah. And they're. Yeah. And they're easier on the eyes. Yes. That's my eyes. As well. OK, so so can I just. Yeah, yeah, OK, so it's part of what the aquanauts Aquarius are trying to find out. They're also trying to crack the more mystical Marine riddles like the secret behind Coral's telepathic communication.

[01:56:18]
This is so crazy. Would be right to it every year, on the same day, at the same hour, usually within the same minute, Corales of the same species, although separated by thousands of miles, will suddenly spawn in perfect synchronicity. The dates and times vary from year to year for reasons only the coral knows stranger. Still, while one species of coral spawns during one hour, another species right next to it waits for a different hour or a different day or a different week before spawning and synchronicity with its own species distance seems to have no effect.

[01:56:57]
If you broke off a chunk of coral and placed it in a bucket beneath a sink in London, that chunk would in most cases spawn at the same time as other coral of the same species around the world, which is crazy. Like you could take a piece of coral, break it off, put it in London and another coral, the same species will, in synchronicity spawn at the exact same time frame.

[01:57:20]
You have no idea why the synchronous spawn is essential for coral survival. Coral colonies must continuously expand outward to thrive, expand outward, to thrive, to remain healthy and strong. They must breed outside of their gene pool. With neighbouring colonies once released to the surface, the coral, sperm and eggs have only about 30 minutes to fuse any longer, any longer, and the coral eggs and sperm will either dissipate or die off. Researchers have found that if the spawning is just 15 minutes out of sync, coral colonies chances of survival are greatly reduced.

[01:57:55]
Coral is the largest biological structure on the planet and covers 175 thousand square miles of the sea floor. And it can communicate in a way far more sophisticated than anyone ever thought. And yet, coral is one of the most primitive animals on earth. Coral has no eyes, no ears and no brain crazy. That's insane.

[01:58:19]
Yeah, that's I thought as well.

[01:58:21]
It's fascinating, too, that you just have no idea why or how. I mean, what is the what's the mechanism for the communication, the fact that if something's under a sink in London and it sinks up coral, the same species on the side of the planet, like what is I think, like one of the most futuristic minds of our life, those is Jim Cameron.

[01:58:40]
I think like Avatar and Terminator two would like the machine. I he's like I think like, wow, he really didn't have a lot.

[01:58:52]
He knew some shit. The trees all communicating with each other. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:58:57]
Well you have you read about mycelium and the the fungus underneath the soil that actually the trees utilize it through the root structures and they communicate through that. You know, there's some sort of a there's some sort of a mycorrhizal relationship that fungus has with with these trees, and they actually somehow or another communicate through each other as well. They like using the soil like this. That's crazy. We think of soil as being dirt. Right. Just but there's lots in there.

[01:59:31]
Yeah. Yeah. All sorts of biological life living in that soil. Yes. And these trees in different plants actually through their root structure, communicate and use the use the fungi that live in the soil. And it's very, very Paul Stamets was a wizard when it comes to mycology and talking about fungus. And he's got some amazing work that he's done just his whole life studying mushrooms. And it's like no advance when he talks to you about it.

[02:00:00]
Like, you just really get this feeling like there's something going on that we don't totally understand. Like the largest animal, the fungus is kind of an animal. It breathes oxygen and it brings out carbon dioxide.

[02:00:13]
So I just know that, yeah, the relationship is fungus that mushrooms have with the earth is in some ways more similar to us than it is to plants because plants are breathing and carbon dioxide, obviously, and breathing out oxygen. So the fungus closer to fuck. Yeah.

[02:00:32]
Then they're living with these things. And there's a group of fungi, I guess, in the Pacific Northwest. It's the largest living creature other than I guess like biological organism you would say was a coral reef. But there's something in the Pacific Northwest that's fucking enormous and it's just one interconnected mushroom structure.

[02:00:53]
Wow. It's very heavy. Yeah. And obviously the right ones can bring you to God. The right ones can connect you to alien life and yeah. You know, the future and tell you what you're doing wrong with the planet. Yeah. Yeah. So there's something, there's something going on with these things.

[02:01:09]
A different part of your consciousness. Well, we're just very egocentric and arrogant in our ideas about what the human race means to the rest of the planet, because we have this ability to manipulate things and send texts and emails.

[02:01:20]
And it's just about our portions, basically, just because our fingers, the ability to like.

[02:01:25]
Yeah, but we think that's so important because it's so important to us, because it's so significant, like the ability to watch a television show or not be able to have the ability to fly in a plane or not. Those things are so significant that we think of them as being the most significant things in the world. But meanwhile, there's some animals like like when you see a flock of birds fly in synchronicity and some sort of strange dance and you like, how the fuck are they doing that?

[02:01:50]
Yeah, no one knows. They really don't. You think there's all this guesswork? They're not really sure exactly what's going on. How do they know how to travel thousands of miles every season and go back to the place where they spawned like they don't know. They don't know like how to Samin Sam and figure out a way to get all the way back to where they were born.

[02:02:10]
They they make their way all the way through the river, to the ocean. And then when it's time to rock and roll, they get all the way back and they have to get back to that one spot. They can't get just any old river. They won't they won't make it. They won't survive. They won't spawn. They won't do it. They have to get back to the place where they belong and something in their little salmon brains or in their salmon biological system lets them know.

[02:02:31]
And we don't know what it is. We don't know what it is, but we fuck up and we dam these river structures and then they die and they die off the Pacific Northwest as if they had a huge problem with that. And they didn't understand it. When they first put these dams in place, these salmon would just pull up and they try to redistribute them to other places and then they'll like, nope, I need to go back to where I'm from.

[02:02:52]
It's weird, man, biological life is weird and it's is amazing and funny, you're right.

[02:02:58]
Yeah, we think we're so because we can do things that other ones can't do, but they can do things we can do. Yeah. We just don't put a high priority on what they can do. Yeah. For whatever egocentric reason.

[02:03:09]
Yeah. But I was it was like I was swimming in Tonga in the Pacific Northwest and I was with humpback whales and I was with my daughter and we looked at the mother and the calf, you know, I mean, you know, swimming. We were watching them and. It was it's the most beautiful, overwhelming moment, I'll show you after some footage, but then I was alone. And I was like holding my breath and kind of freediving next to them and, you know, when you're not on scuba, it's not they're happy to be around you and free diving and swimming with the mother and the baby.

[02:03:57]
And I'm looking at the mother and I'm certain certain that she's just looking at me, but in the nicest way, like in the most peaceful, it was just it's not like a shark either.

[02:04:10]
Whoa. This thing is like. Yeah, so I'm like certain that she's like being trying to communicate something.

[02:04:20]
So I'm still in the same breath and I go like this. I open my arms up and turn to the mother like this or something like that. And the mother mimics the, the humpback mimics me and turns right towards me and goes like this.

[02:04:35]
Right. So now we're swimming together and I'm like this kicking I've fins and the the humpback is doing the mother is doing that to me. And I'm swimming in synchronicity with with the mother and the baby's father. And then as soon as I'm like done from here and I go back down, she goes back down. And it was like, I want to cry. But yeah, it's I think it's a little dance. But also their brains are so much bigger than our because they're so yeah.

[02:05:04]
I still have all this water in my stomach. So if I'm going to do this, let's do it. So you need another one of those names. What is the reason why you need so much water to do this? Is it so that the frog has a place to be?

[02:05:24]
So the frog is safe? You know, I've never injured a frog or anything. I'm sure he feels very comfortable knowing that here he goes. Oh, Jesus. You hop right out. Yeah, he's like, I know what the fuck is happening here.

[02:05:41]
Oh, hey, buddy, let me just. Okay, so OK, I just usually like to get them a little bath.

[02:05:51]
Yeah, good. OK. So this is basically the technique and I've put up to 10 frogs inside. Look, so he come. The more. And now we could hang and talk for, you know, so long. So how long does he stay in their. What's the longest you've kept him in there and they live like three hours or so and none of them have ever died. Wow, that's pretty mean how bad you have to be right now.

[02:06:42]
I don't want to 10.

[02:06:45]
Any time anybody complains about needing to pay, I'm going to show them this video. Tenth, the tenth quarter and what are they, eight ounces? Sixteen, 16. It's more like. It's more than a gallon of water. Yeah. Now. It's the magic of like a up empty. And I have to, like, get him to swim up to the. How do you do that? And I just like it and had fluoroscopy eyes and looked where they were and then saw that they had a sword.

[02:07:31]
I did Sword Swamp to like. Do you feel them moving around on you when there's a lot, when there's 10? Jamie, your face. It comes no, I go first. I like to get a little bit of. Forcing them out now.

[02:07:57]
Can't talk, just goods, more water was the first time he did this one. I. I worked on it. I started like. Three or four years ago, and it's been, you know, the first time you put the frog in your mouth, got salmonella, and I didn't swallow the first, I just wanted to get comfortable with the salmonella. Yeah. And then I got it again after I tried it the second time. And then I built up a resistance to salmonella.

[02:08:34]
Oh, Jesus.

[02:08:36]
I mean, that's good. If you like sushi mouth empty, right? Here comes the. This is so bizarre. Here comes. It's because I drank so much, so it's like. After, like, locatable, you have to locate kind of. The sound, what would you call this, Jamie Asmar? This is so strange, so for people that are just listening, I highly recommend you go to the video because you're going to have to condense.

[02:09:44]
No, no, no, no. We're going to keep this up exactly the way it is. People need to say, oh. Take out like a liter of water. Oh, God, it's so strange.

[02:10:13]
No, I spit on Biggie, and it's called the water spout, that's I usually put out the fire.

[02:10:22]
Oh my God. Hola. The frog is probably like, what the fuck did I do to deserve this? I bet that frog was just like an asshole person in another life.

[02:10:46]
That's a gallon of water. Do we need another bucket?

[02:10:50]
Maybe go could get that plastic back in the back. The the the I don't know if that's good enough, but for now, we'll just use that for now.

[02:11:03]
It is quite preposterous to watch the amount of water that's coming out of you.

[02:11:09]
Oh, I think you know better. Where is he at right now? Boy, is there. Got them in there, put them in my hands. OK. And there he is. Oh, boy, here, little fella, let's watch a little, fellow, you've had a rough life in that road. You've had a road, PATTY So that's the frog truck.

[02:11:56]
He's alive and perfect. Yeah, he seems fine.

[02:12:00]
Don't lose. I don't want to lose him, but hey, you want to put it back in the jar?

[02:12:05]
We give him a big bowl of some little bit of water fresh. OK, I think going to need more than paper towels, Jamie.

[02:12:26]
Yeah, I'm and my hands eventually. Oh, here.

[02:12:31]
Oh, you have a pair, Jamie real ones, I don't know.

[02:12:36]
But is that just coincidental?

[02:12:38]
No, no, no. There was a guy, Ed Calderon. He's a guy who used to work with the Mexican police at the border and they take a few paper towels to you out.

[02:12:50]
And he he brought us some handcuffs to teach us how to get out of them, right?

[02:12:55]
Yeah. I just noticed that there were there random problem that seems planned. Yeah, but that's really they were just here.

[02:13:06]
He gave them to me and he gave me like a little tool to show me how to how to walk, how to open them.

[02:13:13]
What's this plastic thing? I've no idea. But he gave you tools to show you how to. I'm like, how I don't remember. I have to go back and watch the video. Yeah. How to get the fucking show.

[02:13:25]
I got to pick them and shove it through the thing to kind of like, go past the teeth of the lock to make it open up. So I had to pick them.

[02:13:34]
Yes, exactly. Oh. So I'm not going to work, I don't know. We're trying to do I see like. What do you physically trying to do? Oh, I just want to see if I can actually break them. Break them, yeah, like break the metal. So, like, really break them for real. How do you usually do that? I don't know. You don't know? No. It's like really hard to break.

[02:14:11]
Was it usually easy to break them? No, it's always very difficult to break handcuffs because you're breaking the handcuffs. Right. But you're trying.

[02:14:20]
Yeah. Because there's some sort of technique to it or something using leverage. And that's what I'm hoping, but I don't know. How many days of your life do you think you spent fucking with handcuffs? You just. Boil it all down to time 50. Yeah, this is probably boring for, like anybody that's a big. So you just trying to use the way the attachment as a leverage point to start your thing? Yeah. That thing might be weird, weird thing, but, yeah, I'm trying to use like.

[02:15:14]
What is the yellow thing that we know just how Ed brought them to us? You know, if I can get these things broken, hmm, you think we could talk it by now, like it's going to be stuck out there?

[02:15:28]
Yeah, but you'll be so preoccupied. Yeah. The frogs, like, what the fuck does happen? Look at him.

[02:15:35]
He's just sitting there breathing.

[02:15:36]
So, yeah. Imagine him being a frog like, well, this is it. I knew it was coming one day. That's why I'm so scared of bass.

[02:15:46]
By the way, there. Yeah, these are the ones I get are like normally they would be like used for bait. So first I asked the guys, give me some here and they became my daughter's pet. So the shipper I've never, never, ever injured or hurt a frog, but how did you know that that was going to be the case when you first swallowed one, the first one you swallowed? You probably had to be like, oh, I didn't start the fire started with, like, bingo balls and things like that.

[02:16:14]
And I would put up I started playing around. So it started with like, you know, how much water I put in and how could I spout the water out to use it to put out the fire, then put the kerosene float on top. And I went to landscape.

[02:16:28]
Be so bad for you and for you. What is kerosene like inside your body? Feel it burning.

[02:16:34]
No, but the problem is all that's. No, the problem is all that stuff has a residue. What is this guy doing, James? Oil based.

[02:16:40]
This is the kitchen waterspout thing.

[02:16:43]
Haji Ali, Egyptian fire eater in human fountain. Do you know of this guy?

[02:16:48]
Yeah, that's the guy I'm talking about. Oh, there it is. Yeah, he's a boy. There's a really funny clip of see, he's spitting the kerosene and then he puts it out with the water, which is underneath.

[02:17:00]
It floats on top. Yeah. Look how much control he has.

[02:17:04]
I saw that act and wanted to, like, figure that out.

[02:17:08]
What year is this the like almost a hundred and twenty five of the last 100 years ago.

[02:17:15]
I mean, that guy had to go. He was called the human fire hydrant. That had to be a rough way to go. How he died because he probably every day took a toll.

[02:17:25]
Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah.

[02:17:27]
Forget those that we have, we don't need they're very slippery. So let me get back to the question that I have before you ran off because you got worried about your arm.

[02:17:36]
Do you do you have like you've done so many insane stunts and so many really of these bizarre things that require so much of you?

[02:17:47]
Do you do you like have a thing in your mind that you have to keep ramping it up and that do you have a place that you would ultimately like to get to do with these things?

[02:17:57]
No, I just constantly, like, kind of try to figure out, like, what things have been done in the past historically. And then I try to figure out how to make them interesting and then I figure out how to make them kind of modern. So it's not like, you know, it's like it's a it's a small step by step process. And I think about each thing and then I try to put them all together.

[02:18:21]
But do you feel like you have to keep pushing the envelope? Well, I have like a few things I've been trying to work on to get to that place. So there is like it's not a push the envelope. It's to save a bunch of things. I've been trying to.

[02:18:37]
How many do you have? Like on the back burner in the back of head? Two more crazy ones that I can't share them. Uh. The thing I will tell you is that if you put them all together, the letters all equal out like my name, so that and that's all you can say.

[02:19:00]
But yeah, I don't want to go too into it.

[02:19:04]
What do you enjoy most? Do you enjoy Dundies? Like if you talk about something too much, then you talk it away.

[02:19:09]
I understand. Yeah. Yeah. You take away the magic of like well he's going he's going to do what. Yeah. Like when it gets announced. Yeah. Yeah.

[02:19:17]
Do you enjoy doing these big things or do you enjoy the live shows or do you enjoy freaking people, just random people out like all of it.

[02:19:28]
So it's not like one specific thing. I kind of love doing card tricks of the magic. I love doing things from history. I love looking like the the human aquarium guy, you know, the frogs and goldfish. And some of that came from Houdini writing a miracle mongers all about his act. So it's like you look into the history of things that have been done, like Hage-Ali, the human fire hydrant, and you find these there's a great book that Ricky Jay wrote who is an amazing magician, where he discusses and explains everything, learn all of these things, put them together.

[02:19:56]
And then what I do that Ricky thought was amazing is an insane is I can actually take these ideas that that seem impossible, but magical. And that's what the amazing part is, taking them from a hypothetical image and then learning how to do them. So that's like what's amazing about the whole process to me.

[02:20:16]
And Ricky's book called Learn the Pigs. And there's so many bizarre but amazing acts that exist in there. So it's like you look at them like, no, that can't be real, but it was real. If you believe it was real.

[02:20:28]
How many of there how many of you are there out there? Like, this must be a I always think of stand up comedians as being a very small group of people that can only understand each other.

[02:20:39]
There's a good amount of amazing magicians. How many?

[02:20:44]
A thousand. On the planet now, there's a lot of guys that are I mean, yeah, and there's different categories, but the stuff that you're doing is not just magic.

[02:20:55]
What I'm saying is like this sort of like the crazy. Yeah. You're like you're mixing it all. You're transcending magic into it.

[02:21:01]
You go into this weird realm of what I like because I like to use the body as the prop. So I have to figure out how to do things where, like, your body is magic.

[02:21:09]
And I think that comes from like I didn't have, like, you know, a lot of many resources to like, oh, go. Which is lucky because then I was like, OK, so what can I do with, like, what's around like an ice pick or a bunch of water or industrious.

[02:21:22]
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, not yeah.

[02:21:24]
But like you have to figure it out but you also how do you balance it out with like I mean you obviously develop some problems from not eating that one time. And you know, you've, you've got these stunts where they have this possibility of physically injuring you permanently.

[02:21:40]
Yeah.

[02:21:41]
Yeah. So I wanted to balance out the risks and the rewards. Yeah.

[02:21:45]
There's not that many of those people out there. I hope not. No, that's what I'm saying.

[02:21:49]
Like the people I worry about them. You don't worry about yourself. Well, I think I'm careful, you know. Yeah. I'm still like so we did one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ten, five, five liters.

[02:22:05]
Basically that's like I think that's in one shot. I think that's a record. I don't think I've actually ever done that many. You never drink that much water? I don't think so. I think I usually kapit a gallon.

[02:22:18]
Well, it's dangerous, right. You can die from drinking too much water intoxication. Yes. Yeah. But I think that's if you like, flush it out too much.

[02:22:26]
But, but when you combine that with other things and it's so that's what kids have done like in like photography fraternity when they have to do those hazing rituals. Right. If died from drinking too much water and there was a woman in San Jose. Yeah, it is possible. Of course, it was San Jose where she was on the radio.

[02:22:46]
And there was a thing like, how much water can you drink if you want to win an Xbox for a kid? And she died. Yeah, yeah.

[02:22:52]
I think that's when your electrolyte levels get messed up. Is that what her heart stops. Yeah, because yeah.

[02:22:57]
So you, you water become just too much water in your system and your body doesn't know what to do with it and. Yeah that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

[02:23:06]
And it flushes out and puts the imbalance off. I mean your electrolytes.

[02:23:10]
So when you do something like this do you make sure that you consume a lot of electrolytes beforehand because you know, because I couldn't eat or do anything. If you're going to do the frog and why my friend told me do not do the frog. Why sounds gross. I don't want you to have to do that because I have to listen to it.

[02:23:30]
It definitely does sound gross. But you feel OK after drinking all that water that quickly.

[02:23:36]
Yeah, but I spouted it out. That's true. That's most of it. Right. There's got to be a lot which is on purpose.

[02:23:41]
Yeah. Jesus. You're a weird man, David Blaine. You really are. That's what I was getting at, like what I'm saying, there's not a lot of people like you out. I'm glad you're there. I really am. I'm glad you're out there, first of all, because I think you're very entertaining, but also because I'm I I love when there's a new type of person that I meet, you know, and you're there's not I've met a lot of people, but you're you're in this new like, oh, and then there's this guy, you know, this is like a totally new frequency of human or just freak out, but take out the quinsy both.

[02:24:19]
But I mean, it's it's a very strange path that you're on. I mean, ultimately, it's like at the end of the day, it's trying to just figure out how to make things that seem as close to magic as possible. And the process is really difficult and tricky and labors to get to. But eventually you start to figure, oh, this could look magical that this or this could, you know, but you seem like a very joyful person because of all this.

[02:24:48]
You clearly love what you do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:24:51]
We do that. You spark. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how I do it. I know you love it.

[02:24:56]
Yeah. That's what's interesting. It's like such a strange thing to love to do. Stand by, not I used to do is crazy fight, take a long time, but but I'm saying that's crazy like it is maybe.

[02:25:11]
But that's the same. It's the same. You're pushing your body to do things that most people but you're basically you're living in a place where you have to override discomfort and have to override what your body's trying to tell you not to do. And you push yourself, you know, and then and it's that whole journey of pushing yourself to do things that you physically don't think you can do or to set a goal that that's the best part.

[02:25:37]
I think I'm just I'm fascinated by people that are really far down on a path that seems to be ever brought up. That woman, Stephanie Mullingar, on the podcast before. I follow her on Instagram and I know I've posted some of her stuff on Instagram, but she's like a contortionist and she has like an incredible balance and core strength. And she's a very small woman who does insane things with her body, like she did this one. She's on a handstand and she bends her back so that her butt touches her head.

[02:26:10]
Like her spine is so flexible that you look at some of the things that she does and they don't seem to be like, watch this.

[02:26:17]
Look at this. Yeah. Watch how she does this and look. And also she's bouncing on these posts. Right. So but look what she does with her. Wow. Look at that. That is amazing. Amazing.

[02:26:29]
Yeah. And then she stands with one hand and she by the way, she does this like off the side of cliffs and she's incredible.

[02:26:36]
Like, look at the way her body is contorted that and she's pressing her butt against the top of her head in the craziest way. Like it doesn't seem like a person should be able to do that. And the amount of physical strength that it takes to move your body like this and balance while you're doing it is just it's the year and the amount of time.

[02:26:59]
Yeah, this is what I'm saying. Like she's so far down the path. See if you can find the one when she bounces on the plates, that one in the middle. We see the plate. Watch this.

[02:27:08]
So she takes a this is like a standard Olympic weightlifting plate, right. So she puts it down. So it's on its edge. And then she stands it on top of a bar. Right. So you got this like this bar that was like a small chance for balance.

[02:27:26]
Yeah. So it's around saying bouncing on another round thing's amazing.

[02:27:31]
And then she lifts her whole body all the way up and over and does a handstand on this fucking thing. I mean, she's amazing. It's unbelievable. And again, always smiling, always like joyful, loves, loves this.

[02:27:47]
But the physical strength that it takes to do something like that and to kind of balance, that's what I'm talking about. Like someone who's on this crazy path.

[02:27:55]
Where have you you asked someone, could someone do that, you know, but your body doesn't work like that. It's not a body works, but it does.

[02:28:02]
You just have to take these little baby steps for years and then you look back and you're in a different place.

[02:28:07]
And then also you find a version of it and then you figure out how to make it your own. Yes. Yeah. Taking something and then made it like a hole.

[02:28:16]
Yes, you are right. Poetic. Yeah.

[02:28:20]
Yeah. She's like Cirque de Soleil. Like when every time I go to see her, I've seen most of the Cirque de Soleil shows.

[02:28:27]
Every time I go, I'm like, how are the photos? What are they, what are their aliens like.

[02:28:32]
Yeah, but they're on a path. They're just really far down on this path of extreme dedication, extreme focus. And that's what you're doing. You're just doing it with bizarre physical feats and magic. It's very interesting. It's very interesting. I'm really happy that you're around. I really am.

[02:28:52]
I enjoy the fact that a person like you exists. OK, thank you. And I want to thank you for being here too, man. I really enjoyed the fuck out of it. Was very cool. Very cool to talk to you. Wanting to meet you for a long time. Oh my pleasure and my honor. Thank you very much. Thank you.
