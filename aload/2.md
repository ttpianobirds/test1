yeah which brings me to the one thing

that I wanted to get to before we leave

this is waterboarding yeah and this is

this is something that came up because

you were defending what is it Gail

Medina

Gina what is her name has Bell has Bell

and she is the the person that was being

appointed by to lead the CIA yeah and

there was a bunch of people that were

saying that she shouldn't be because she

advocated torture and you to defend her

decided to get waterboarded yeah we've

actually been talking about this for the

past hour and a half yeah we have we've

been talking about the slow erosion of

of the human condition us getting softer

and us getting weaker and us getting

nerfing the edges and finding the easy

outs and the easy solution the

conversation of middle ground finding a

way that we can communicate with people

and have a discussion

wait so we've been we've been having

this discussion for the past 90 minutes

and what I have is a bunch of people

that are saying what something is but

they don't know what that is

mmm man I know what torture is I've seen

it in Africa I've seen it in South

America I've seen it in the Middle East

I've seen it on almost I'm pushing 20

trips overseas in a military capacity a

handful of combat deployments you know

from looking for poachers human

traffickers drug cartel kind of piracy

the things that I have done like you

want to talk about knowing intimately

what torture is I [ __ ] know what

torture is pouring water on somebody's

face is not torture okay if you starve

them if you beat them if you isolate

them if they're there for you know

you're the only giving yes we can start

adding things on to it but the thing

that was the most irritating was

everybody's just throwing out this let's

talk about morality and this woman is

immoral to be in this position I

remember people jumping to their deaths

on 9/11 because they didn't look at

burnt alive right and then I saw a guy

on his knees and have his throat slit

open by somebody pulling his hair back

and sliding that knife across his throat

that was one of the guys that she

interrogated no I'm not seeing two

wrongs made a right but she interrogated

them to get a question to get questions

out of them to try to save more

Americans the intent was to try to save

more lives they say okay well if it's

not that bad

then why did it work and this is why

this is what nobody understands and it's

because they can't understand the

difference between the easy way and the

hard way is that because these people

that we were waterboarding are cowards

they were [ __ ] they were impotent

little bullies their whole entire lives

if I put you on that waterboard I could

waterboard you for days you have your

moral convictions and you would never

change because you believe in what's

right and wrong and that's a great and

beautiful thing they're not you they are

pieces of [ __ ] that that throw acid on

little girls that fly planes into

buildings because it's capitalist that

that's who these people are and they're

only tough when they're surrounded by

6070 other of their friends but you take

one of them away from that and you put

them in a position where they're

powerless and that's what waterboarding

is the powerless and they cave and they

cower in seconds I don't need to drive a

nail through their hands I don't need to

pull their teeth out I don't take a

drill bit and drive it through their

fingernails that's torture this is us

pouring water on a cowards face and they

freak out and people can't understand

that because they can't understand what

these people are and they're animals

these aren't beautiful religious people

that are trying to do the best thing for

the families these people were the worst

of our kind these were the Nazis of the

1940s but this is the current version of

it in the these radical fanatics that

are doing anything for any reason to

hurt anybody so they can feel better

about themselves and you take them out

of that power you take them out of that

control you take them out of that

opportunity where they can be the bully

and they're just shadows of themselves

and then they give you everything that

you need and what you need is an

opportunity to save more lives well

there's two there's two things that were

discussed about this one that your

situation that you were

and was not in any way similar to the

situation they were in because you were

doing it with your friends you knew you

were gonna be okay you willingly did

this the whole process was very

controlled you you weren't being held by

people who spoke a different language in

a country that hates you

yeah it's it's a situation where you

knew you were safe so you could relax

yourself and calm down and tolerate it

to the point where you knew that you you

would be okay you know there was the

other side the other side is if torture

works isn't that the best form of

torture you're gonna be okay

I mean if torture does work and I don't

know if torture works I've never been

torture I've never been around torture I

know there's a debate both in both

torture doesn't work it doesn't work

doesn't work so that's not torture No so

you think you feel like that works but

torture doesn't so I think too and I

think maybe we're arguing about

vernacular and verbs

well you're forcing someone to do

something they don't want to do and

you're freaking them out yeah you're

doing something physical to them so I

think we just have to define torture if

if it's me doing something to somebody

that makes them uncomfortable is torture

I mean me asking a pointed question at

somebody in an interrogation room down

at LAPD could be torture right you know

if you smack him in the face has it

become torture yeah is that is that

torture right well if I had weapon if I

hit with a phone book maybe the problem

is the word maybe the problem is

defining the word your I mean they then

they call it enhanced interrogation

techniques when if you're trying to get

information out of someone that would

save American lives it seems to me I

mean I may be ignorant but waterboarding

seems to me to be one of the most humane

ways to do it

I agree with that you're not gonna do

any permanent damage to the person it's

not like what they did to John McCain

you know when he was president in

Vietnam and that disturbed the [ __ ] out

of me when that guy was on Fox News and

he called him songbird McCain because he

was saying that you know terrorism that

or torture rather worked on McCain like

her how could you stoop like that I mean

how could you do that I mean you know

what that guy's been through to

humiliate

and humiliate yourself by by by taking

that position on television like that

was so disappointing

it's about usable information we're

we're questioning and if you cross that

threshold of torture where you are doing

damage physical damage where they'll

tell you anything that's not usable

information right wait you're gonna say

that you've you've been you know dating

your producer for you know seven years

and secretly like I could get you to a

say anything under the right conditions

that doesn't do what you just want to

stop the pain yeah just anything to make

it stop that's not what was happening

here and and when we start talking about

morality if they're saying okay if this

is a moral Act then then okay this make

me and all of my friends that have done

all sorts of some in some cases terrible

things are we now immoral people because

we did it in the interest of protecting

our country and serving our country and

and providing protection for our

freedoms and I know those are cliché

phrases that that people grab onto and I

don't want to but then by extension

throwing and lobbying those accusations

at her extend to to me and to the things

that I've done and I think I'm a very

moral person and I try to be a good

person in every way I can imagine I'm

not perfect I'm not but I try and the

politics of bleeding over and and

misusing words manipulating everything

just so it fits your agenda but nobody's

in the middle of ground nobody's

agreeing and nobody has the best

interest at heart

and that's the people like the best

interest should always be serving the

people and none of them are doing that

they only care about what is gonna get

them reelected or what's gonna give them

more power or it's gonna be more money

from the lobby or what's going to give

them more clout for the next vote or

it's gonna give a little handout from

the president or what's you know

whatever games that play that happened

on the Beltway that's what the and that

was an example of that in the most

horrible of ways because it came down to

human lives it came down to somebody

they'd been serving their country since

the eighties in the best way that she

knew how in the ways that were legal for

her to do it and everyone

yells just manipulating the narrative to

fit their agenda when I'm just sitting

here being like how about the people and

how about freedom who's fighting for us

is it are you guys just gonna keep

bickering about this so me strap

strapping myself to that board I'll tell

you it's harder do what's easy is to lay

there strapped and have somebody put

water on your face do it's hard when I

did to steven crowder watch his hands

where he'd reach up and pull the he

couldn't have he couldn't take it he

would pull the rag off his face see how

many times I pulled the rag off my face

not once right every single time I said

no nope or longer no no use the hose use

the bucket right now you're a tattoo I

need you at an eight no I need CIA

interrogation friends right

and I'm sitting there willingly with my

hands what the sensation of me drowning

is that waters running into my sinuses

showing that was intentional

I understand people are like oh no he

was safe he wasn't even tied down I did

that to demonstrate how a man of resolve

can do it effortlessly and how it's not

torture because I could willingly lay

there with my hands-free to pull the rag

off at any juncture but I did it I just

sat there and I asked for more I

understand that but I also understand

the position that people take where they

say you knew you were safe and so this

is why you had this resolve you're

you're not in enemy soil being

interrogated by Isis being strapped down

by them where you didn't know what was

next if you do think this what would be

next let's say Rachel Maddow from MSNBC

because we agree on so much if she's

like hey I want you to come on to my

show I'm gonna bring in five CIA

interrogators and we're gonna do it live

you're in control of nothing do you

think the result would be any different

it's not the same because you're on a

television show and you're still you're

you're Americans are gonna do this to

you

you haven't been captured you're not an

enemy soil you're not you know so how

far did on how far do we have to go you

have to kind of be I mean what the

person who's really captured is really

captured it's not a game it's like if

you get choked out in the street you

can't tap out right if you get in a

physical fight to the death to someone

and they take your back

you can't tap out right in this

situation you know you can tap out you

know that even if it's CIA and terror

getting you and they're yelling at you

there's a part of your brain that knows

I'm on Rachel Maddow Show they don't

kill soldiers on Rachel Maddow Show this

is true so I don't know how I could

better have Illustrated I think you did

a fantastic job I think the problem lies

and it's impossible to really recreate

it without you being an actual prisoner

of war yeah do what we do reverse the

roles we're talking about snatching

these guys from their bomb-making

facility and whisking them to Abu Ghraib

and and pouring water on their face what

happens to me and my friends when we're

captured are we waterboarded no no no no

I'm not I'm not saying that what they do

to us makes what we do to them right ROM

scene is it's better I'm saying it it's

better I mean since what I was saying

before if it is torture

if you want to use the word torture like

we'd use the word drugs right drugs are

coffee and it's also heroin right there

are drugs caffeine is a drug right yeah

torture if you're just gonna say torture

I'll take that torture every day because

that's what that is

yeah because even if it sucks yeah I'm

gonna start alive I'm gonna be slowly

carefully methodically painfully

murdered yeah and that's my only option

there there is never any other option if

I got captured there's no moral

equivalency I think we could both agree

there's no I mean between us and them

there's not but here's the thing McCain

himself said that she shouldn't be

appointed because she willingly

participated in torture he said that

yeah the what did you think about that I

one respect his opinion I things that he

has done whether we agree on things are

is irrelevant his his resume speaks for

spell I agree and I think very few

people could speak to torture better

than him I agree with that as well so

him coming from that position and saying

that she isn't eligible to serve is a

very powerful statement um I also feel

that I have

pretty intimately familiar with torture

and that I understand the full spectrum

of what somebody can do selflessly for

their country and selfless selfishly for

their own satisfaction as a psychopath

like Zarqawi's enforcer that would go

around and kill people in front of their

own family members and had carried

around a battery-powered drill and like

I saw that we tracked him so I also know

that when she was doing all of these

things for her whole entire career one

they were you have to look at the

context of the time and what was

happening and when she did every single

one of those things they were authorized

techniques they were encouraged they

were successful in some degrees to some

degree and so she was trying to do the

best that she could in the with the son

in some cases limitation that she had

and I think that is a trait that I want

and somebody leading the CIA that is

that they're gonna do the best that they

can with what they have and what they're

allowed to do and I got like that I

realized that but this isn't someone

who's talking about this in the you know

the comfort of a boardroom this is

someone who's dealing with it in time of

war yeah and you're dealing with some of

the most horrible people that we've ever

experienced that are making these videos

of cutting journalists heads off and

sending them to their families yeah I

mean this is this is this is really what

we were experiencing when people were

deciding to use these enhanced

arrogation techniques this is what they

were up against this isn't something

that you can discuss in a classroom and

and get a full sense of the the tone and

what was happening in these people's

lives 9/11 was the tip of the iceberg

when that happened there there were

hundreds of other plans to do similar

things with the that one was just

successful they had been trying others

and they have tried other since whether

it's a shoe bomb whether it's a Paris

train whether it's a San Bernadino

bombing whether it's a a

a garbage truck in France you know or

London Bridge it's any any they they

have consistently been trying to do that

and duplicate and replicate that the

reason that it hasn't happened again to

that scale to that level is because of

the uncompromising selflessness of

heroes trying to protect Americans now I

don't want to go into what is the

greater good

okay are we losing morality coming

that's a rabbit hole that we could talk

about forever but man I just want to

preserve life well I think that concept

is so hard for people to grasp it's Gary

well not just that but the concept that

the reason why this hasn't happened more

often is because of these people doing

the hard work why is that so hard for

people to understand cancers did hard

work I just made a goddamn TV show just

so they could see for the first time

that people work hard so they can have

food and they have work hard so they

could have oil and they got power like

people they look at a post when I don't

have a shirt on

everybody says man Tim love and being

off you sada

I've looked the same since I was 19

years old I have looked exactly like

this with the same eight pack with the

same muscle definition since I was an 18

year old kid I don't even know how many

times I've been tested from the military

for you sada two different events I've

been clean my whole entire career but

nobody can in their mind they can't

understand to get from here to there is

hard work though there has to be an

easier way it has to be steroids or it

has to be this or has to be that it's

the same way they're protected and

they're safe but they can't grasp the

idea of the hard work that it took to

keep them there I don't even
